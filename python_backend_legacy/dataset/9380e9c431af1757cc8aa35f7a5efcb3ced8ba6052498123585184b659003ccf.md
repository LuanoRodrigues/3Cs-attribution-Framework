Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation\n**Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación\n**Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation\n## Introduction\nIn the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats (Way and Casey 2008). Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous\ndata about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to \"capture\" large parts of the public being targeted (Vicic and Harknett 2024).\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n3\nterintuitively, these first “catches” aren’t primarily useful for their social network connections. Rather, the goal is to infect their computers with malware. Invitations to cheap music downloads and free political entertainment content create a web of machines infected with click fraud software, which manipulates browsers to view troll-created content elsewhere online and increase its visibility to a growing network of users. To content hosts and the rest of the world, growing interest in such content now appears natural, providing a foundation for more capable attempts to manipulate discourse.\nThe chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO) (Vicic and Gartzke 2024). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed (Etudo et al. 2023), it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO (Hunter et al. 2024). There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace (Whyte 2020a). But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution\n1. Though it should be noted that there is little evidence of this use of malware leading to any noteworthy amplification of malign influence in the 2016 case. For macro overviews of the case, see *inter alia* Jamieson (2020).\nrisks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n2. For work that increasingly ties digital action to subversion as an alternative strategic framework to coercion or rationalist bargaining traditions within IR, see Maschmeyer (2023) and Deibert (2022).\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine (Lin 2022; Bronk, Collins and Wallach 2023) and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) (Petrosyan 2024). These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s (Way and Casey 2019). These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n# Findings\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) (Maness et al. 2023). However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n3 Importantly, this article follows Cormac, Walton and Van Puyvelde's (2022) distillation of success for covert operations. The authors acknowledge that success for covert operations is inherently difficult to measure, not only because of the underlying secrecy implied. More than just that, the objectives and acceptable outcomes for such campaigns are fluid and so success must inherently be subjective. Cyber operations like the CEIO described here might be characterized as analogous. From a methodological point of view then, this means that success must be gauged as extant only if success has been assessed by a set of credible third-party observers. That approach is contained within the CSIO dataset.\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox\nThis article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks (Whyte and Etudo 2020). As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research (Etudo et al. 2023) that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest (Zegart et al. 2023) perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another (Maschmeyer 2021). Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsome compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action\n⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and (Whyte 2020b).\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro\n⁴\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n9\ncesses in the same period. In the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, cyber attacks have waxed and waned seemingly in line with changing domestic political conditions, either featuring during IO and then dropping away or vice versa. And beyond Russia, states like Iran and China have increasingly married basic intrusion techniques to create the infrastructure of influence, including extensive social impersonation attacks, use of website injection techniques, etc., to expand networks into which malign content can be poured. By studying these cases, IR scholars stand to much more clearly elaborate on the operational interactions of mechanisms of state power that are similar but yet clearly diverge in their strategic utility.",

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation **Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación **Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation ## Introduction In the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats. Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous data about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to\"capture\"large parts of the public being targeted.\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun CHRISTOPHER WHYTE The chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed, it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO. There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace. But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution risks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine  and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) . These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s . These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n# Findings\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) . However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox This article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks. As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another. Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest The Subversion Aversion Paradox some compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action ⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and.\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter. Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro ⁴ CHRISTOPHER WHYTE",

    "# Resumen El trabajo reciente en materia de tecnologías de la información y conflictos cibernéticos en el campo de las RRII se ha centrado en un fenómeno de rápida expansión: las operaciones de influencia cibernéticas (CEIO, por sus siglas en inglés). Las CEIO representan una interacción única con lógicas operativas que difieren de las excepciones, tanto de las campañas cibernéticas como de las campañas de influencia. Con el fin de examinar cuándo los Estados eligen desplegar operaciones cibernéticas en apoyo de las operaciones de influencia, recurrimos a un nuevo conjunto de datos, el conjunto de datos de Operaciones de Influencia de la Contrasociedad (CSIO, por sus siglas en inglés), que busca representar la interferencia por parte de la contrasociedad en términos más granulares que los recursos de datos existentes. Adoptamos un esquema de codificación único que caracteriza las diferentes formas de ataques cibernéticos que se han utilizado para ayudar a influir en los resultados y desplegar covariables novedosas, y, el cual nos permite confirmar que la gran mayoría de episodios de CEIO involucran el uso preparatorio de intrusiones cibernéticas que son de baja intensidad y que probablemente desaparecerán después de los primeros tres meses de una campaña de influencia.

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation **Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación **Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation ## Introduction In the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats. Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous data about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to\"capture\"large parts of the public being targeted.\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun CHRISTOPHER WHYTE The chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed, it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO. There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace. But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution risks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.",
    "# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence": "How do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine  and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) . These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.",
    "# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO": "To study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s . These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.",
    "# Findings": "Descriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) . However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox This article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks. As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another. Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest The Subversion Aversion Paradox some compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action ⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and.\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter. Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro ⁴ CHRISTOPHER WHYTE"

CEIO represent a unique interaction of operational logics that diverge from the exceptions of either cyber or influence campaigns.

By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success.

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation **Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación **Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation ## Introduction In the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats. Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous data about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to\"capture\"large parts of the public being targeted.\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun CHRISTOPHER WHYTE The chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed, it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO. There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace. But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution risks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine  and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) . These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s . These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n# Findings\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) . However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox This article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks. As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another. Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest The Subversion Aversion Paradox some compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action ⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and.\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter. Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro ⁴ CHRISTOPHER WHYTE",

CEIO represent a unique interaction of operational logics that diverge from the exceptions of either cyber or influence campaigns. In order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. By adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the \"subversion aversion\" paradox, a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\n# Resumen\nEl trabajo reciente en materia de tecnologías de la información y conflictos cibernéticos en el campo de las RRII se ha centrado en un fenómeno de rápida expansión: las operaciones de influencia cibernéticas (CEIO, por sus siglas en inglés).

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation\n**Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación\n**Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation\n## Introduction\nIn the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats (Way and Casey 2008). Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous\ndata about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to \"capture\" large parts of the public being targeted (Vicic and Harknett 2024).\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n3\nterintuitively, these first “catches” aren’t primarily useful for their social network connections. Rather, the goal is to infect their computers with malware. Invitations to cheap music downloads and free political entertainment content create a web of machines infected with click fraud software, which manipulates browsers to view troll-created content elsewhere online and increase its visibility to a growing network of users. To content hosts and the rest of the world, growing interest in such content now appears natural, providing a foundation for more capable attempts to manipulate discourse.\nThe chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO) (Vicic and Gartzke 2024). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed (Etudo et al. 2023), it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO (Hunter et al. 2024). There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace (Whyte 2020a). But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution\n1. Though it should be noted that there is little evidence of this use of malware leading to any noteworthy amplification of malign influence in the 2016 case. For macro overviews of the case, see *inter alia* Jamieson (2020).\nrisks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n2. For work that increasingly ties digital action to subversion as an alternative strategic framework to coercion or rationalist bargaining traditions within IR, see Maschmeyer (2023) and Deibert (2022).\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine (Lin 2022; Bronk, Collins and Wallach 2023) and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) (Petrosyan 2024). These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s (Way and Casey 2019). These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n# Findings\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) (Maness et al. 2023). However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n3 Importantly, this article follows Cormac, Walton and Van Puyvelde's (2022) distillation of success for covert operations. The authors acknowledge that success for covert operations is inherently difficult to measure, not only because of the underlying secrecy implied. More than just that, the objectives and acceptable outcomes for such campaigns are fluid and so success must inherently be subjective. Cyber operations like the CEIO described here might be characterized as analogous. From a methodological point of view then, this means that success must be gauged as extant only if success has been assessed by a set of credible third-party observers. That approach is contained within the CSIO dataset.\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox\nThis article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks (Whyte and Etudo 2020). As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research (Etudo et al. 2023) that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest (Zegart et al. 2023) perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another (Maschmeyer 2021). Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsome compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action\n⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and (Whyte 2020b).\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro\n⁴\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n9\ncesses in the same period. In the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, cyber attacks have waxed and waned seemingly in line with changing domestic political conditions, either featuring during IO and then dropping away or vice versa. And beyond Russia, states like Iran and China have increasingly married basic intrusion techniques to create the infrastructure of influence, including extensive social impersonation attacks, use of website injection techniques, etc., to expand networks into which malign content can be poured. By studying these cases, IR scholars stand to much more clearly elaborate on the operational interactions of mechanisms of state power that are similar but yet clearly diverge in their strategic utility."

CEIO represent a unique interaction of operational logics that diverge from the exceptions of either cyber or influence campaigns. In order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. By adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the \"subversion aversion\" paradox, a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\n# Resumen\nEl trabajo reciente en materia de tecnologías de la información y conflictos cibernéticos en el campo de las RRII se ha centrado en un fenómeno de rápida expansión: las operaciones de influencia cibernéticas (CEIO, por sus siglas en inglés).

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation\n**Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación\n**Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation\n## Introduction\nIn the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats (Way and Casey 2008). Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous\ndata about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to \"capture\" large parts of the public being targeted (Vicic and Harknett 2024).\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n3\nterintuitively, these first “catches” aren’t primarily useful for their social network connections. Rather, the goal is to infect their computers with malware. Invitations to cheap music downloads and free political entertainment content create a web of machines infected with click fraud software, which manipulates browsers to view troll-created content elsewhere online and increase its visibility to a growing network of users. To content hosts and the rest of the world, growing interest in such content now appears natural, providing a foundation for more capable attempts to manipulate discourse.\nThe chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO) (Vicic and Gartzke 2024). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed (Etudo et al. 2023), it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO (Hunter et al. 2024). There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace (Whyte 2020a). But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution\n1. Though it should be noted that there is little evidence of this use of malware leading to any noteworthy amplification of malign influence in the 2016 case. For macro overviews of the case, see *inter alia* Jamieson (2020).\nrisks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n2. For work that increasingly ties digital action to subversion as an alternative strategic framework to coercion or rationalist bargaining traditions within IR, see Maschmeyer (2023) and Deibert (2022).\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine (Lin 2022; Bronk, Collins and Wallach 2023) and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) (Petrosyan 2024). These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s (Way and Casey 2019). These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n# Findings\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) (Maness et al. 2023). However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n3 Importantly, this article follows Cormac, Walton and Van Puyvelde's (2022) distillation of success for covert operations. The authors acknowledge that success for covert operations is inherently difficult to measure, not only because of the underlying secrecy implied. More than just that, the objectives and acceptable outcomes for such campaigns are fluid and so success must inherently be subjective. Cyber operations like the CEIO described here might be characterized as analogous. From a methodological point of view then, this means that success must be gauged as extant only if success has been assessed by a set of credible third-party observers. That approach is contained within the CSIO dataset.\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox\nThis article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks (Whyte and Etudo 2020). As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research (Etudo et al. 2023) that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest (Zegart et al. 2023) perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another (Maschmeyer 2021). Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsome compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action\n⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and (Whyte 2020b).\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro\n⁴\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n9\ncesses in the same period. In the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, cyber attacks have waxed and waned seemingly in line with changing domestic political conditions, either featuring during IO and then dropping away or vice versa. And beyond Russia, states like Iran and China have increasingly married basic intrusion techniques to create the infrastructure of influence, including extensive social impersonation attacks, use of website injection techniques, etc., to expand networks into which malign content can be poured. By studying these cases, IR scholars stand to much more clearly elaborate on the operational interactions of mechanisms of state power that are similar but yet clearly diverge in their strategic utility."

CEIO represent a unique interaction of operational logics that diverge from the exceptions of either cyber or influence campaigns. In order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. By adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions.

Adoptamos un esquema de codificación único que caracteriza las diferentes formas de ataques cibernéticos que se han utilizado para ayudar a influir en los resultados y desplegar covariables novedosas, y, el cual nos permite confirmar que la gran mayoría de episodios de CEIO involucran el uso preparatorio de intrusiones cibernéticas que son de baja intensidad y que probablemente desaparecerán después de los primeros tres meses de una campaña de influencia.

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures. Je nomme la dynamique qui en résulte le paradoxe de “l'aversion à la subversion”, une situation dans laquelle la probabilité d'une action performative pendant l'OI devient plus probable quand la probabilité d'une réussite subversive chute.\n**Keywords**: cyber conflict, influence operations, information warfare, subversion, disinformation **Palabras clave**: conflicto cibernético, operaciones de influencia, guerra de información, subversión, desinformación **Mots clés**: cyberconflit, opérations d'influence, guerre de l'information, subversion, désinformation ## Introduction In the third decade of the twenty-first century, it doesn't take a national security expert or even a particularly avid news reader to be familiar with the distinct elements of Internet-enabled influence campaigns. Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats. Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous data about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to\"capture\"large parts of the public being targeted.\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun CHRISTOPHER WHYTE The chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed, it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO. There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace. But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution risks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine  and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) . These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus\nThe Subversion Aversion Paradox\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s . These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n# Findings\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) . However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n\nwith the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox This article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks. As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another. Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest The Subversion Aversion Paradox some compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action ⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and.\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter. Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro ⁴ CHRISTOPHER WHYTE"

CEIO represent a unique interaction of operational logics that diverge from the exceptions of either cyber or influence campaigns. In order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. By adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the\"subversion aversion\"paradox, a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\n\n---\n\n## # The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\n\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.\nCHRISTOPHER WHYTE\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine  and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) . These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.",

Les OICT représentent une interaction unique des logiques opérationnelles qui se différencient des exceptions des campagnes d'influence ou cybercampagnes. Afin d'examiner le moment où les États choisissent de déployer des cyberopérations pour soutenir les opérations d'influence (OI), je me tourne vers un nouvel ensemble de données (Counter-Society Influence Operations [CSIO]) qui cherche à représenter l'interférence de la contre-société en des termes plus granulaires que les sources existantes de données. En adoptant un schéma de codage unique qui caractérise les différentes formes de cyberattaques employées pour influencer les issues et en déployant des covariables inédites, je confirme que la vaste majorité des épisodes d'OICT impliquent une utilisation préparatoire de la cyberintrusion qui est de faible intensité et disparaîtra probablement après les trois premiers mois d'une campagne d'influence. Par contraste, peu de cyberactivités connexes impliquent des tentatives d'intrusion et de perturbation aussi importantes. Toutefois, contre toute logique, je trouve clairement des éléments pour confirmer qu'il existe une corrélation négative entre la réussite d'une campagne et les graves cyberactivités, enclines à l'escalade et liées aux OI. Pareillement, il existe un lien positif entre ce genre d'activités et tant l'attribution éventuelle de belligérants qu'une nouvelle mesure de la congruence entre les objectifs des belligérants et les factions politiques nationales mineures.

Dozens of campaigns since the mid-2010s have followed similar formats (Way and Casey 2008). Disinformation factories produce sensationalist content about domestic events. Bot accounts and paid trolls stir up fringe communities before trying to push disruptive narratives on mainstream social media platforms. And sometimes, web personas masked in a layer of pseudonimity push supposedly scandalous\n\ndata about celebrities and political elites. Such campaigns are multi-faceted. That said, they also face a series of challenges to success, many of which stem from the outsider-looking-in dynamic of interference from abroad that necessitates avoiding attribution and makes it difficult to \"capture\" large parts of the public being targeted (Vicic and Harknett 2024).\n\nConsider an added layer to such a campaign. First, a divisive event takes place in a targeted nation. Then, foreign influence operatives swing into action. They craft messaging designed to attract social media users, appealing to their outrage and their desire to act. Coun",
    "CHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n3\n\nterintuitively, these first “catches” aren’t primarily useful for their social network connections. Rather, the goal is to infect their computers with malware. Invitations to cheap music downloads and free political entertainment content create a web of machines infected with click fraud software, which manipulates browsers to view troll-created content elsewhere online and increase its visibility to a growing network of users. To content hosts and the rest of the world, growing interest in such content now appears natural, providing a foundation for more capable attempts to manipulate discourse.\n\nThe chain of causality here is straightforward. Simple messaging techniques create a foundation for cyber tools to amplify operational resources and rapidly scale the spread of malign influence. This is a cyber-enabled influence operation (CEIO) (Vicic and Gartzke 2024). It’s also reality. Specifically, as recent research has revealed (Etudo et al. 2023), it is the exact shape of events that transpired during Russia’s attempt to manipulate the 2016 presidential election season in the United States.¹ And on the surface, this particular style of using cyber instruments to aid influence makes logical sense. Preparatory intrusions when a campaign is still young bring numerous benefits whilst minimizing the risk of discovery. Cyber attacks of different kinds can help create botnets of the kind noted already. Network infiltration allows for reconnaissance amenable to planning a complex counter-society operation. And cyber operations can more directly access valuable information about target demographics or elite actors.\n\nSomewhat ironically, this tactical style of deployment of cyber operations in support of influence campaigns is under-emphasized in the growing number of studies that seek to better problematize and conceptualize CEIO (Hunter et al. 2024). There are certainly important elements of ongoing debates about cyber activity as intelligence contests vis-à-vis more conventional strategic activity, which I discuss below, but the CEIO context is generally understated. In part, this stems from an ongoing conflation of terminology surrounding the projection of state power in various forms through cyberspace (Whyte 2020a). But many of those treatments that explicitly seek to understand when cyber operations are deployed alongside influence operations (IO) also seem to exclusively emphasize the prospective value of cyber operations for the direct generation of influence, such as via the hacking of voting infrastructure. Given the inherent attribution\n\n1. Though it should be noted that there is little evidence of this use of malware leading to any noteworthy amplification of malign influence in the 2016 case. For macro overviews of the case, see *inter alia* Jamieson (2020).\n\nrisks involved in such attacks, it is not clear why much cyber scholarship in IR sees value in CEIO along these lines rather than in terms of cyber operations’ prospective tactical and operation-specific contributions.\n\nIn order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. I argue that IR scholars’ present focus on the influence-generating value of cyber operations during CEIO stems from reliance on existing datasets that are primarily geared towards mapping the landscapes of cyber conflict and political interference, but not the incidence of tandem operations. The result is a set of resources and knowledge that is illustrative but noisy.\n\nBy adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the “subversion aversion” paradox,² a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.\n\nThis research note thus makes two key contributions to IR and the cyber conflict studies field. First, the use of CSIO data highlights the significance of preparatory cyber activities as a key driver of cyber-enabled influence operations relative to the prospect of more conventional notions of cyber-generated influence. Second, I draw attention to a novel interaction dynamic between cyber and influence activities, namely that worsening conditions for subversive success clearly change the calculus for the deployment of cyber operations on the part of a belligerent. Tracking recent research, this supports the idea that digital age IOs are substantially sensitive to the domestic conditions of targeted nations. Here, it seems likely\n\n2.

    "The Subversion Aversion Paradox\n\nthat as domestic aversion to subversion increases, the strategic value of IO-linked cyber operations shifts to performative action and preparation for influence generation in future campaigns. As such, both the intelligence- and signaling-oriented expectations of conventional cyber conflict thinking play out, but only in direct relation to the functional requirements of IO.\n\nUltimately, the contribution made here might be best thought of as an argument in favor of better tactical theorization of the relationship between cyber action and strategically meaning effects. This is not new, either with cybersecurity analysis at the point of threat hunting or in a broader historical perspective. But it is novel in cyber warfare debates within IR. Much as understanding German airpower in the opening days of World War II requires comprehension of Luftwaffe doctrinal development as a ground-support instrument that reacts to the maneuver and communications of armored forces, growing evidence points to the idea that cyber operators live off the land and so filter their view of strategic imperatives through tactical conditions they encounter. Thus, what this research clearly offers is a means of bridging cyber conflict studies yet further into IR's varied programs of security studies, most notably intelligence studies and covert operations.\n\n# The Interaction of Cyber Effects and Malign Influence\n\nHow do cyber effect operations and IO interact? Specifically, how do cyber techniques augment efforts to generate malign influence or vice versa? Existing scholarship includes three baskets of relevant research. First, there is a discussion in IR and linked areas of social science research on informational and conflict phenomena on the manner in which political power is projected through cyberspace (Whyte, Thrall and Mazanec 2021). This broad discourse says much about influence and cyber effects—all of which is definitionally varied and thus potentially problematic (e.g., Jensen 2017; Cordey 2019; Hansen and Lim 2019; Ramluckan, Wanless and van Niekirk 2019; Rid 2020)—but also includes helpful efforts to map the confluence of the two, in particular several data collection programs. Studies by and Martin et al. (2023) in particular have both recorded incidences of cyber and influence activities occurring contemporaneously or emerging from threat actors, such as Russia's Fancy Bear or Sandworm groups, that are linked with both toolkits. Figure 1 below combines these datasets to descriptively illustrate the landscape of what the scholars involved\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Global cyber-related IO campaigns, as recorded by both Foote et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2023)\n\nhave variously called \"cyber information operations\" or \"political interference\" activities with cybersecurity characteristics.\n\nThe datasets demonstrate a conspicuous convergence in the methodologies employed by foreign aggressors to achieve comparable objectives. However, it's significant to note that neither focuses their coding choices directly on the question of operational utility of cyber methods for influence operations. Cyber event datasets like DCID have noted IO contemporaneously present in cases of major (and minor) cyber disruption but do not describe operational ties. In the case of DCID, the dataset creators are accounting for a range of cyber-related activities that happen to include information operations rather than assuming any technique connection. Moreover, the criterion for inclusion involves activities that scale towards strategic significance, something that creates ambiguity for any research program (such as this one) where the goal is to study operational interaction. On the other side of things, online influence campaign datasets tend to code for cyber threat actors' involvement in IO, not incidence of tandem operations. In part, the form of such datasets emerges from a simple specification that interference making use of \"cybertechnologies\" is to be captured. For macro-analyses of interstate or state-to-non-state activities, these parameters suffice. For the operational level of analysis, the lack of focus on mechanical elements of such campaigns is problematic.\n\nSecond, there has more recently been focused empirical scholarship centered on CEIO. This body of work has also showcased terminological conflations regarding activity in or around cyberspace but has also delivered several key touchpoints in the form of case-specific empirical findings. Studies like those by Etudo et al. (2023) and Vicic &amp; Gartzke (2024) seek to discern the underlying factors driving the trajectory of these influence activities.",
    "CHRISTOPHER WHYTE\n\nThere's a prevailing notion that IO exhibit tactical sophistication beyond mere alignment with national interests. Are they primarily tools for sowing division, exploiting societal fault lines for strategic distraction? Or are they heavily influenced by case-specific intelligence and outcomes? Perhaps the nature of IO witnessed in recent years is more intricately linked to the organizational context, such as Russia's GRU, rather than broader strategic considerations. Alternatively, could IO lack consistent structures, evolving through learning cycles to eventually exhibit coherent patterns? Recent work in this area suggests several assumptions in need of validation, most notably the idea that domestic developments drive operational decision-making.\n\nFinally, there has been a substantial amount of conflict-specific investigation of digital harm tied to major flashpoints in the Twenty-first century, particularly Russia's war on Ukraine (Lin 2022; Bronk, Collins and Wallach 2023) and paradigm-setting events like the second Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (with its widespread use of unmanned platforms) (Petrosyan 2024). These cases validate or call into question assumptions key to unpacking the interactive logic of CEIO deployment. Particularly the idea that cyber capabilities are consistently shaping the operational logics of other methods of conflict engagement short of war and that proximity increasingly exists in the institutional sources of cyber and other interference capacities.\n\n# Methodology: A New Look at CEIO\n\nTo study when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset, the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset. CSIO was constructed as a means to understand in more granular terms than existing data resources the interaction between different operational elements of political interference activities, or what some in IR are increasingly labeling \"grey zone conflict.\" The dataset was not initially developed with a sole focus on cyber operations and other influence activities, but rather with the diversity of the toolkit of political interference in mind and an intention to provide resources for scholars to study patterns in the functional interaction of different capabilities, from the use of cyber effects to dark money injections, assassination, and more.\n\nThe CSIO dataset stretches from 2008 to 2021. The unit of analysis for the dataset is, in the same vein as other resources like DCID, discrete political interference campaigns. However, CSIO is intentionally bounded as technique agnostic so as to avoid the shortcomings of existing resources for the task of understanding operational\n\nutility and interactions. For each recorded event, there is presented an analytic justification for the operational distinction of one campaign from other similar ones. CSIO covers 57 victim nations and records 32 belligerent nations (or their proxies) across the 14-year span. A number of resources were used in the construction of CSIO, including existing datasets like those mentioned above, but also original open-source information collection and interviews with campaign victims (e.g., critical infrastructure operators and political operatives).\n\nThe CSIO dataset contains a host of covariates useful for analyses of political interference operations as a multi-spectrum phenomenon. These include a number of political and social process objectives coded at the level of individual campaigns (i.e., not at the level of individual belligerents), detailed descriptions of methods deployed, campaign time scales, attribution at campaign endpoints, incidence of prior CSIO in targeted nations, Polity IV regime type information, and more.\n\nTwo sets of covariates bear additional elaboration. First, the description of cyber methods—among other methods of engagement like assassination—follows two standards (coded as two different sets of covariates). On the one hand, the categories made standard by DCID are reflected in the CSIO dataset. On the other hand, however, mindfulness of the likelihood that cyber operations are deployed as an adjunct to broader influence activities and so might not be best understood purely in terms of their relative threat to information systems prompted the development of an additional coding scheme. Specifically, I delineate four types of cyber-mediated influence maneuvers—(1) preparatory intrusions, (2) manipulative attacks, (3) attacks in parallel, and (4) influence-enabling activities. Preparatory intrusions entail activities that exploit the informational advantage gained from cyber intrusions to amplify the effectiveness of subsequent influence endeavors, predominantly through tasks such as reconnaissance, resource accumulation (e.g., botnet establishment), or commandeering of accounts. Manipulative attacks represent the most discussed category of activity among researchers examining CEIO, encompassing actions designed to directly exert influence (e.g., by infiltrating voter systems or manipulating social media algorithms). Attacks in parallel entail cyber operations conducted against a nation simultaneously with influence endeavors but lacking clear operational synchronization. Lastly, influence-enabling attacks subvert the traditional paradigm of CEIO by employing interference activities to bolster the sociopolitical ramifications of cyber operations.\n\nSecond, I include a measure of sociopolitical congruence adapted from the work of Way and Casey on Rus",
    "The Subversion Aversion Paradox\n\nsian interference efforts during the 2010s (Way and Casey 2019). These three measures record the intersectionality of interests between the belligerent responsible for political interference activities and different formations of domestic political actors in targeted nations—(1) major mainstream political parties, (2) other minor or fringe political elements, or (3) significant non-political actors.\n\nThe dependent variable is the incidence of a cyber effect operation tied to a discrete influence campaign. This is constructed for deployment in testing in three ways. First, a simple measure of incidence of any cyber effect event is used. Second, an index variable accounting for repeated use of cyber methods during IO is utilized. Finally, a measure of escalation of cyber effect operations from simple preparatory events to more operationally and strategically meaningful manipulative or concentric attacks is operationalized and deployed.\n\n# Findings\n\nDescriptively, the CSIO dataset captures 67 distinct cyber effect operations during influence campaigns. These range, methodologically, from simple probing intrusions to disruptive and degrading attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) and even some use of ransomware. Most CSIO campaigns defined in the dataset feature cyber effect operations at least twice (mean = 2.113). Most cyber effect operations conducted as linked to CSIO occur within the first three months of a campaign and measure as a 1 on the 10-point severity scale adapted for use in DCID by Valeriano et al. (i.e., probing attacks, propaganda dissemination, etc.) (Maness et al. 2023). However, 13.43 percent of all captured cyber effect operations rate between 2 and 4 on the DCID severity scale and involve more sophisticated or more confrontational effects, from targeted harassment of sociopolitical actors and denial and disruption attacks to critical infrastructure network intrusion. And a sizable minority of cyber effect operations tied to CSIO are seen after the first three months of a given campaign's start point. Specifically, 31.34 percent occur after the three-month mark, with 16.41 percent seen after six months and 7.4 percent after a full calendar year.\n\nTo further investigate the operational linkages between cyber effect operations and IO, I deploy a logistic regression using the dependent variables described above and a core set of CSIO covariates (omitting several to avoid collinearity issues). The results support the idea that there is a nuanced set of dynamics at work when it comes to the targeting of CEIO and their evolution over time under different campaign conditions. Specifically,\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Binomial logit regression models of cyber incidence, repeated event and escalatory repeated event CSIO dependent variables\n\nthe models presented in figure 2 suggest several relationships, some expected and some prospectively counterintuitive. They find that cyber effect operations are negatively associated, albeit minorly, with IO that are successful in their assumed objectives. $^3$  At the same time, cyber is positively associated with higher Policy IV scores, expectedly painting democracies as the target of CEIO dramatically more frequently than anocratic or authoritarian states. Across the board, cyber operations are also associated with eventual correct formal attribution of an IO by the national government of the targeted state. Some additional interactions are weak or neutral, including an established history of hostilities between the states involved.\n\nPerhaps of greatest interest are the divergent relations between cyber effect operations incidence and the dependent variables for repeated and escalatory cyber behavior linked to an IO. Escalatory cyber behavior is much more negatively associated with success in process outcomes for the belligerent at 90 percent confidence. Such behavior is also much more positively associated with the eventual attribution of a given CSIO campaign. But possibly most curious is the finding that escalatory cyber during an IO is strongly and statistically significantly associated\n\n3 Importantly, this article follows Cormac, Walton and Van Puyvelde's (2022) distillation of success for covert operations. The authors acknowledge that success for covert operations is inherently difficult to measure, not only because of the underlying secrecy implied. More than just that, the objectives and acceptable outcomes for such campaigns are fluid and so success must inherently be subjective. Cyber operations like the CEIO described here might be characterized as analogous. From a methodological point of view then, this means that success must be gauged as extant only if success has been assessed by a set of credible third-party observers. That approach is contained within the CSIO dataset.",
    "with the congruence covariates. Congruence with major political parties in a target state appears likely to mute the escalatory inclinations of belligerents conducting CEIO. On the other hand, congruence with minor and fringe elements is substantially more likely to align with escalatory cyber behavior during a campaign. These findings are less apparent for the alternative dependent variables and hold across diagnostic testing that uses cyber operations severity categories as ordinal measures.\n\n## Discussion: The Prevalence of Preparatory CEIO and a Subversion Aversion Paradox\n\nThis article argues that CEIO are an understudied phenomenon in international security studies and that initial studies illustrate clearly distinct operational dynamics from the expected logics of cyber effect operations deployment outlined in mainstream research on global cyber conflict. Deployment and initial testing of a new dataset here—the CSIO dataset on combined operations during political interference campaigns—serves to validate this assertion. Foremost among the descriptive and statistical findings of testing, the CSIO data upholds basic assumptions about CEIO found in recent conceptual explorations. Specifically, CEIO appear to have been primarily deployed against democratic nations, reflecting the expansion of Internet-age political interference generally.\n\nAt the operational level, the limitations of cyber effect operations for augmenting IO are apparent. The “outsider looking in” dynamic of malign foreign influence campaigns means that IO perpetrators face an evolving risk-payoff calculus where greater operational success mutes the potential gains to be found in cyber capabilities employment, selective or otherwise, and amplifies operational risks (Whyte and Etudo 2020). As such, cyber attacks that attempt to aid a broader influence campaign via direct attack on national information or sociopolitical systems risk poisoning the strategic maneuver writ large. This dynamic underscores the common trope among scholars, particularly historians of propaganda and clandestine influence campaigns, to consider cyber effect operations as singularly useful for preparatory or limited reinforcement activities. Early use obscures intended cumulative effects, commitment is often cheaper than alternative preparatory tools, and known sociopsychological components of cyber engagement may create alternative informational effects. However, beyond these circumstances, risks rise. Cumulative effect potential becomes less opaque, there may be strong incentives for public reporting among elites or industry under threat, the complex deployment of combined capabilities creates space for organizational misstep, and there are likely long-term dissimulation costs associated with discovery. In short, the incentives to obtain cyber effects generally recede as an IO gets underway, a trend clearly illustrated in the data.\n\nThese findings also broadly back up an assumption suggested in recent research (Etudo et al. 2023) that cyber-enabled IO are subservient to the logic of IO rather than to an overarching “logic of the [cyber] domain,” regardless of whether one aligns with the persistence (Fischerkeller, Goldman and Harknett 2022) or intelligence contest (Zegart et al. 2023) perspectives that presently dominate academic discourse on cyber conflict. Specifically, CEIO deployment is clearly shaped by domestic conditions within the targeted states across the campaigns recorded in the CSIO dataset. Again, the timing of most cyber effect operations early in campaigns vs. late-stage interventions initially suggests sensitivity to the operational contours of IO. Importantly, this idea of necessary tradeoffs tracks recent contributions by Maschmeyer and others, particularly in the idea of the subversive trilemma for cyberspace operations more broadly that must trade positive values for the potential speed, intensity of effect, or operational control of an activity against one another (Maschmeyer 2021). Here, as with the trilemma, conditions simply dictate that negative correlation between the value propositions of certain cyber actions at particular times and in a particular fashion determines clear patterns of the CEIO approach.\n\nMore significantly, the minority subset of cases where repeated cyber effect outcomes are escalatory in nature bifurcate around divergent indicators of domestic favorability to the objectives of belligerent malign influence activities. Where one or more major political parties are susceptible to elements of outside influence, CEIO deployment adheres to the logic of IO's “outsider-looking-in” dynamic and remains ancillary. Where alignment is found only with minor, outsider political entities within a target nation, there is a high likelihood of late-stage campaign escalation via cyber effect operations. This finding is made stronger via the similar result linking alternative IO support tools (such as bribery, assassination, etc.) and escalating use of cyber effect operations.\n\nThe link between CEIO and domestic conditions seems clear in the aggregate. But what might explain the dynamic illustrated by this testing of the CSIO dataset wherein CEIO usage typically toes the line of IO's operational need for restrained deployment but occasionally switches tack during late-stage campaign phases under conditions of only marginal domestic susceptibility to influence? Both the findings here and existing work suggest",
    "The Subversion Aversion Paradox\n\nsome compelling explanations. First, not only does alignment between belligerent interests and marginal political forces tie to escalatory cyber usage, but also the negative association between belligerent and major political party interests combined with the prevalence of more severe cyber events clustered late in the average IO campaign suggests a failure of attempted subversion tied to escalatory CEIO. So why do belligerents change tack under such conditions? Recent work on subversion in IR might offer a conceptual answer,⁴ which is that cyber operations in favor of a countervailing domestic political element appear to help harden the silo of opposition even as they reduce the likelihood of process-based (e.g., electoral) success. In other words, as subversion seems less likely to the belligerent, attention turns—where feasible—to strategic gain beyond the scope of the current campaign, whether by preparing for future interference or otherwise.\n\nI preliminarily label this dynamic the “subversion aversion paradox.” The paradox here is as follows: whereas most CEIO activity corresponds to the logic of IO that demands restrained deployment of ancillary methods of generating malign influence, the probability that more disruptive or performative efforts will be deployed in support of the influence campaign increases when the likelihood of IO success in achieving subversive objectives are low. There are good reasons to think that this pertains to an effort to salvage interference campaign effects by using performative actions to harden divisions in a target state. Some research has suggested that cyber attacks can be used to harm trust in formal democratic processes (though only when they are visible to the median citizen).⁵ Work on far-right communities and Russian interference through the 2010s suggests that obvious interference may serve to solidify broader sociopolitical opposition to fringe elements in targeted societies,⁶ thus heightening “othering” effects and making those marginal populations more susceptible to future manipulation.\n\nAnd literature on subversion during the Cold War highlights other rationales for subversion with publicly visible elements. Carson and Yarhi-Milo, in particular, assess that there are invariably observers of covert action\n\n⁴ For an introduction to this literature, see inter alia Wohlforth (2020) and Lee (2020).\n⁵ For instance, see discussions in recent work by Gomez and Shandler (2024).\n⁶ Perhaps the clearest empirical demonstration of this is in Etudo et al. (2023). Otherwise, we might cite a number of sources for this assertion, including Klapsis (2015); Laruelle (2015), Vicic and Gartzke (2024), and (Whyte 2020b).\n\n(strategic adversaries and key partners, they argue) and that the costs of acting covertly with certain limited visible outcomes thus matter (Carson and Yarhi-Milo 2017). Here, outside assistance to a marginal political element may serve as a narrative tool by which supporters could be convinced of broader, global support for their cause (e.g., white supremacist or other far right causes). Indeed, there are robust incentives for such fringe actors to embrace outside help via its refutation. After all, refuting the existence of outside assistance in the face of clear evidence of interference opens door to “leaderless resistance” effects where causes can simultaneously present as a legitimate political voice and one nefariously supported by hidden actions that might be present across many aspects of society.\n\nThis short presentation and examination of new data on CEIO and digital-age interference campaigns more broadly has illustrated clear tensions between the strategic and operational deployment of cyber as adjunct method of power in international affairs. Future research would do well to elaborate on the various determinants of decisions to generate cyber effects along these different lines. Particularly, further validation of the idea of a “subversion aversion paradox” is desirable, even given the strong descriptive and statistical large-N evidence proposed herein.\n\nFortunately, there are a host of yet-understudied cases of influence campaigns that contain no cyber effect components and various formations of use of cyber instruments. There is a tendency to focus on paradigm cases of cyber-enabled interference, particularly the 2016 Russian campaign. But other notable cases that have received attention and which appear in the CSIO dataset yet require more in-depth process examinations. Recent work has, for instance, highlighted the activities of non-state actors like the Belarusian Cyber Partisans (BCP) in using cyber attacks to compromise government databases or disrupt infrastructure control systems in order to generate positive coverage of their grievances alongside more common influence activities. More conventionally, Russian engagement of European democracies through the 2010s has involved a varied deployment of cyber instruments alongside social media manipulation and other IO mechanisms. In the United Kingdom, targeted attacks of political infrastructure and government websites occurred in the general elections bracketing the Brexit referendum period but were curiously absent during that debate and the Scottish referendum period that preceded it. In Montenegro, Russian cyber activities have been extensive across at least four different years of political interference, a contrast with the lack of cyber engagement during IO targeting Italian and Bulgarian sociopolitical pro\n\n⁴",

In the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, cyber attacks have waxed and waned seemingly in line with changing domestic political conditions, either featuring during IO and then dropping away or vice versa. And beyond Russia, states like Iran and China have increasingly married basic intrusion techniques to create the infrastructure of influence, including extensive social impersonation attacks, use of website injection techniques, etc., to expand networks into which malign content can be poured. By studying these cases, IR scholars stand to much more clearly elaborate on the operational interactions of mechanisms of state power that are similar but yet clearly diverge in their strategic utility.\n\n# References\n\nBronk, Chris, Gabriel Collins, and Dan S.

    "abstract": "Recent work on information technology and cyber conflict in IR has turned to the rapidly expanding phenomena that is cyber-enabled influence operations (CEIO). CEIO represent a unique interaction of operational logics that diverge from the exceptions of either cyber or influence campaigns. In order to examine when states choose to deploy cyber operations in support of IO, I turn to a new dataset—the Counter-Society Influence Operations (CSIO) dataset—that seeks to represent counter-society interference in more granular terms than existing data resources. By adopting a unique coding scheme that characterizes different forms of cyber attacks leveraged to aid influence outcomes and deploying novel covariates, I confirm that the vast majority of CEIO episodes involve preparatory use of cyber intrusion that is low-intensity and likely to fall away after the first three months of an influence campaign. By contrast, few such related cyber activities involve more severe intrusion or disruption attempts. Counterintuitively, however, I find clear evidence that severe and escalatory cyber activity linked to IO is negatively associated with campaign success. Likewise, this activity is positively tied to both eventual belligerent attribution and a new measure of congruence between belligerent objectives and minor domestic political factions. I call the resulting dynamic the \"subversion aversion\" paradox, a situation in which the probability of performative action during IO becomes more likely as the likelihood of subversive success drops.",
