However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas. Sin embargo, las diferencias con respecto a lo que constituya una «conducta acceptable» han obstaculizado el progreso en la formulacion de estas normas. En los ultimos años, los países occidentales han adoptado una estrategia con el fin de indicar que es lo que se considera un comportamento inaceptable a工程技术 de la atribución publica de los ciberataques y las intrusiones. Argumentamos que el acto de atribución publica oficial sirve como una practica para que los países expresen su desaprobación con respecto al comportamento inapropiado en el ciberespacio y condenen este comportamento. también, pueda dar forma deforma acumulativa a las practicas internacionales, responsabilizando al Estado atacante.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran\nPalabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán\nMots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran\n# Introduction\nOn September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\n\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\" (Rama 2022).\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours (Aljazeera 2022). The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5). How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences (Baram and Sommer 2019; Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Smeets 2021; Baram 2023a). Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution\nIn recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend (Joshi 2024a; 2024b). The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent (Feingold 2023). This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace (Farrell 2015; Sherman and Morgus 2018; Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs 2019; Janofsky 2021; Price 2021).\nWhy Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries (Goldman 2020). Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Lonergan and Lonergan 2023). Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively (Stevens 2012; Crowley and Gerstein 2014; Rowe 2018).\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; on norms for cybersecurity, see Finnemore 2011; Finnemore and Hollis 2016; 2020). One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members (Ullmann-Margalit 1977, 8). Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Finnemore 2011). They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community (Deitelhoff and Zimmermann 2020). However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998). Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations (Erskine and Carr 2018; on norms diffusion, see Erickson 2017; on the role of the military in promoting cyber norms, see Lonergan and Schneider 2023).\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 895). Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896--901; see also Hurel and Lobato 2018). Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 902--905). In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain (Rogers 2014).\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation (Henriksen 2019, 6).\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and\nGIL BARAM\n5\nstability of the digital environment. By fostering a collective understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace, the aim is to prevent the escalation and minimize the risks associated with cyber conflict (UN GGE, 2015).\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace (UN GGE, 2015). These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” (UN GGE, 2015, 2). However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms (Davis and Lewis 2019; Kulikova 2021).\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages (Wheelwright 2016).\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states (Painter 2021; UNODA 2021).\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 (UNODA, 2021; United Nation 2021). In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" (UNODA 2021).\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability (Kello 2024; on the ASEAN countries, see Tran Dai and Gomez 2018; Tan and Ang 2022). Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions (Ristolainen 2017; Claessen 2020). Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking (Grigsby 2017, 12). These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures (Grigsby 2017; Kello 2021; On norm sabotage, see Schneider 2021).\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them (DeNardis 2014). To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Rebello 2017). Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards (Tiezzi 2014). These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order (Katagiri 2024, 289).\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security (DiploFoundation 2023).\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms (Pohle and Thiel 2020; Ciglic and Hering 2021; Raymond and Sherman 2024).\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states (Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021; Egloff and Smeets 2021). Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks (Tsagourias 2012; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2019; Baram 2023a). Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility (Lindsay 2015). In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary (Mueller et al. 2019, 107).\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations (Lin 2017; Eichensehr 2020). Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks (Alperovitch 2018; Kaushik 2019; Egloff 2020a; 2020b; Schroeder 2022). While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks (Bateman 2022). States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape (Egloff, 2020b).\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” (Guterres 2023, 27). This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” (Lewis 2022, 4). Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community (Lewis 2022, 10; on accountability mechanisms in cyberspace, see Pawlak, 2023, 2024). Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions (Carvin 2021). Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats (Lee 2023). However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors (Katagiri 2021, 3). The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities (Baram 2023b).\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware (Ikeda 2023). In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” (Feng 2021).\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee (Whyte 2020), NotPetya (Greenberg 2018), and WannaCry (Chen and Bridges 2017). After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China (Packham 2019; Joint Statement Minister for Home Affairs and Minister of Defence 2021; Evans 2023). Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops (CISA 2022).\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. (Grossman 2023, 28-30; Lyngaas 2022). Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people (Higgins 2023). The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat (Semini 2023).\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM\n13\nand citizens, accusing them of espionage and illegal activities related to the MEK (Oghanna 2023; Zaimi 2022).\n## The Investigation\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" (Higgins 2023; Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022). A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. (Higgins 2023). The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy (Ajazeera 2022; Rama 2022). This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy (Zaimi 2022).\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them (Zaimi 2022).\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations (CISA 2022). Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities (Miller 2022). In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis (NATO 2022). In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation (Miller 2022). The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation (Miller 2022).\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## Conclusions\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\n15\ntions to sculpt and sway the direction of acceptable behavior. The data showed that official public attribution is a growing practice, as the US leads this practice along with other Western countries. The 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania has demonstrated official public attribution in action, thereby enriching the discourse on the evolution of cyber norms with practical and policy relevant insights.\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\n# Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research.",

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran Palabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán Mots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran # Introduction On September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\".\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours. The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself”. How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences. Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution In recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend. The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace.\nWhy Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries. Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations. Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively.\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations. One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members. Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community. They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community. However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one. Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations.\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization. Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue. Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale. In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain.\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation.\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and GIL BARAM\n\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace . These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” . However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms .\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages .\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states .\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 . In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" .\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability . Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions . Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking . These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures .\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them . To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization . Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards . These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order .\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security .\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms .\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states . Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks . Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility . In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary .\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations . Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks . While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks . States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape .\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” . This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” . Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community . Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions . Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats . However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors . The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities .\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware . In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” .\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee , NotPetya , and WannaCry . After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China . Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops .\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. . Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people . The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat .\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM\n\n## The Investigation\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" . A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. . The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy . This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy .\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them .\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations . Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities . In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis . In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation . The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation .\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## Conclusions\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\n\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution # Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research.",

The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges.

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran Palabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán Mots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran # Introduction On September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\".\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours. The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself”. How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences. Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.",
    "## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution In recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend. The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace.": "Why Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries. Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations. Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively.\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations. One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members. Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community. They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community. However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one. Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations.\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization. Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue. Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale. In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain.\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation.\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and GIL BARAM",
    "## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN": "Two parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).",
    "## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS": "Information Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace . These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” . However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms .\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages .\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).",
    "## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP": "In December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states .\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 . In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" .",
    "## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation": "The process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability . Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions . Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking . These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures .\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them . To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization . Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards . These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order .\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security .\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms .\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states . Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks . Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility . In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary .\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations . Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks . While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks . States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape .\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” . This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” . Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community . Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions . Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats . However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors . The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities .\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware . In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” .\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.",
    "## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution": "The use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee , NotPetya , and WannaCry . After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China . Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.",
    "## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022": "### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops .\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. . Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people . The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat .\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM",
    "## The Investigation": "Hired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" . A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. . The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy . This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy .\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them .",
    "## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution": "Iranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations . Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities . In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis . In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation . The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation .\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.",
    "## Conclusions": "In this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution # Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research."

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran Palabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán Mots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran # Introduction On September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\".\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours. The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself”. How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences. Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution In recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend. The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace.\nWhy Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries. Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations. Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively.\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations. One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members. Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community. They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community. However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one. Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations.\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization. Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue. Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale. In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain.\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation.\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and GIL BARAM\n\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace . These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” . However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms .\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages .\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states .\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 . In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" .\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability . Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions . Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking . These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures .\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them . To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization . Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards . These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order .\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security .\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms .\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states . Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks . Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility . In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary .\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations . Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks . While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks . States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape .\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” . This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” . Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community . Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions . Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats . However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors . The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities .\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware . In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” .\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee , NotPetya , and WannaCry . After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China . Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops .\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. . Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people . The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat .\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM\n\n## The Investigation\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" . A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. . The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy . This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy .\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them .\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations . Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities . In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis . In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation . The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation .\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## Conclusions\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\n\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution # Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research.",

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran\nPalabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán\nMots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran\n# Introduction\nOn September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\n\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\" (Rama 2022).\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours (Aljazeera 2022). The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5). How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences (Baram and Sommer 2019; Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Smeets 2021; Baram 2023a). Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution\nIn recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend (Joshi 2024a; 2024b). The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent (Feingold 2023). This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace (Farrell 2015; Sherman and Morgus 2018; Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs 2019; Janofsky 2021; Price 2021).\nWhy Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries (Goldman 2020). Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Lonergan and Lonergan 2023). Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively (Stevens 2012; Crowley and Gerstein 2014; Rowe 2018).\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; on norms for cybersecurity, see Finnemore 2011; Finnemore and Hollis 2016; 2020). One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members (Ullmann-Margalit 1977, 8). Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Finnemore 2011). They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community (Deitelhoff and Zimmermann 2020). However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998). Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations (Erskine and Carr 2018; on norms diffusion, see Erickson 2017; on the role of the military in promoting cyber norms, see Lonergan and Schneider 2023).\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 895). Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896--901; see also Hurel and Lobato 2018). Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 902--905). In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain (Rogers 2014).\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation (Henriksen 2019, 6).\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and\nGIL BARAM\n5\nstability of the digital environment. By fostering a collective understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace, the aim is to prevent the escalation and minimize the risks associated with cyber conflict (UN GGE, 2015).\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace (UN GGE, 2015). These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” (UN GGE, 2015, 2). However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms (Davis and Lewis 2019; Kulikova 2021).\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages (Wheelwright 2016).\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states (Painter 2021; UNODA 2021).\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 (UNODA, 2021; United Nation 2021). In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" (UNODA 2021).\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability (Kello 2024; on the ASEAN countries, see Tran Dai and Gomez 2018; Tan and Ang 2022). Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions (Ristolainen 2017; Claessen 2020). Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking (Grigsby 2017, 12). These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures (Grigsby 2017; Kello 2021; On norm sabotage, see Schneider 2021).\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them (DeNardis 2014). To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Rebello 2017). Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards (Tiezzi 2014). These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order (Katagiri 2024, 289).\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security (DiploFoundation 2023).\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms (Pohle and Thiel 2020; Ciglic and Hering 2021; Raymond and Sherman 2024).\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states (Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021; Egloff and Smeets 2021). Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks (Tsagourias 2012; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2019; Baram 2023a). Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility (Lindsay 2015). In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary (Mueller et al. 2019, 107).\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations (Lin 2017; Eichensehr 2020). Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks (Alperovitch 2018; Kaushik 2019; Egloff 2020a; 2020b; Schroeder 2022). While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks (Bateman 2022). States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape (Egloff, 2020b).\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” (Guterres 2023, 27). This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” (Lewis 2022, 4). Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community (Lewis 2022, 10; on accountability mechanisms in cyberspace, see Pawlak, 2023, 2024). Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions (Carvin 2021). Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats (Lee 2023). However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors (Katagiri 2021, 3). The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities (Baram 2023b).\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware (Ikeda 2023). In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” (Feng 2021).\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee (Whyte 2020), NotPetya (Greenberg 2018), and WannaCry (Chen and Bridges 2017). After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China (Packham 2019; Joint Statement Minister for Home Affairs and Minister of Defence 2021; Evans 2023). Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops (CISA 2022).\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. (Grossman 2023, 28-30; Lyngaas 2022). Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people (Higgins 2023). The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat (Semini 2023).\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM\n13\nand citizens, accusing them of espionage and illegal activities related to the MEK (Oghanna 2023; Zaimi 2022).\n## The Investigation\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" (Higgins 2023; Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022). A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. (Higgins 2023). The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy (Ajazeera 2022; Rama 2022). This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy (Zaimi 2022).\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them (Zaimi 2022).\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations (CISA 2022). Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities (Miller 2022). In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis (NATO 2022). In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation (Miller 2022). The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation (Miller 2022).\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## Conclusions\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\n15\ntions to sculpt and sway the direction of acceptable behavior. The data showed that official public attribution is a growing practice, as the US leads this practice along with other Western countries. The 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania has demonstrated official public attribution in action, thereby enriching the discourse on the evolution of cyber norms with practical and policy relevant insights.\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\n# Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research."

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran\nPalabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán\nMots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran\n# Introduction\nOn September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\n\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\" (Rama 2022).\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours (Aljazeera 2022). The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5). How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences (Baram and Sommer 2019; Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Smeets 2021; Baram 2023a). Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution\nIn recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend (Joshi 2024a; 2024b). The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent (Feingold 2023). This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace (Farrell 2015; Sherman and Morgus 2018; Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs 2019; Janofsky 2021; Price 2021).\nWhy Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries (Goldman 2020). Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Lonergan and Lonergan 2023). Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively (Stevens 2012; Crowley and Gerstein 2014; Rowe 2018).\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; on norms for cybersecurity, see Finnemore 2011; Finnemore and Hollis 2016; 2020). One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members (Ullmann-Margalit 1977, 8). Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Finnemore 2011). They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community (Deitelhoff and Zimmermann 2020). However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998). Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations (Erskine and Carr 2018; on norms diffusion, see Erickson 2017; on the role of the military in promoting cyber norms, see Lonergan and Schneider 2023).\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 895). Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896--901; see also Hurel and Lobato 2018). Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 902--905). In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain (Rogers 2014).\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation (Henriksen 2019, 6).\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and\nGIL BARAM\n5\nstability of the digital environment. By fostering a collective understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace, the aim is to prevent the escalation and minimize the risks associated with cyber conflict (UN GGE, 2015).\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace (UN GGE, 2015). These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” (UN GGE, 2015, 2). However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms (Davis and Lewis 2019; Kulikova 2021).\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages (Wheelwright 2016).\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states (Painter 2021; UNODA 2021).\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 (UNODA, 2021; United Nation 2021). In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" (UNODA 2021).\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability (Kello 2024; on the ASEAN countries, see Tran Dai and Gomez 2018; Tan and Ang 2022). Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions (Ristolainen 2017; Claessen 2020). Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking (Grigsby 2017, 12). These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures (Grigsby 2017; Kello 2021; On norm sabotage, see Schneider 2021).\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them (DeNardis 2014). To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Rebello 2017). Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards (Tiezzi 2014). These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order (Katagiri 2024, 289).\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security (DiploFoundation 2023).\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms (Pohle and Thiel 2020; Ciglic and Hering 2021; Raymond and Sherman 2024).\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states (Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021; Egloff and Smeets 2021). Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks (Tsagourias 2012; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2019; Baram 2023a). Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility (Lindsay 2015). In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary (Mueller et al. 2019, 107).\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations (Lin 2017; Eichensehr 2020). Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks (Alperovitch 2018; Kaushik 2019; Egloff 2020a; 2020b; Schroeder 2022). While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks (Bateman 2022). States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape (Egloff, 2020b).\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” (Guterres 2023, 27). This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” (Lewis 2022, 4). Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community (Lewis 2022, 10; on accountability mechanisms in cyberspace, see Pawlak, 2023, 2024). Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions (Carvin 2021). Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats (Lee 2023). However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors (Katagiri 2021, 3). The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities (Baram 2023b).\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware (Ikeda 2023). In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” (Feng 2021).\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee (Whyte 2020), NotPetya (Greenberg 2018), and WannaCry (Chen and Bridges 2017). After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China (Packham 2019; Joint Statement Minister for Home Affairs and Minister of Defence 2021; Evans 2023). Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops (CISA 2022).\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. (Grossman 2023, 28-30; Lyngaas 2022). Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people (Higgins 2023). The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat (Semini 2023).\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM\n13\nand citizens, accusing them of espionage and illegal activities related to the MEK (Oghanna 2023; Zaimi 2022).\n## The Investigation\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" (Higgins 2023; Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022). A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. (Higgins 2023). The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy (Ajazeera 2022; Rama 2022). This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy (Zaimi 2022).\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them (Zaimi 2022).\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations (CISA 2022). Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities (Miller 2022). In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis (NATO 2022). In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation (Miller 2022). The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation (Miller 2022).\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## Conclusions\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\n15\ntions to sculpt and sway the direction of acceptable behavior. The data showed that official public attribution is a growing practice, as the US leads this practice along with other Western countries. The 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania has demonstrated official public attribution in action, thereby enriching the discourse on the evolution of cyber norms with practical and policy relevant insights.\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\n# Acknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research."

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran Palabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán Mots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran # Introduction On September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\".\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours. The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself”. How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences. Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution In recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend. The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent. This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace.\nWhy Do We Need Cyber Norms?\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries. Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations. Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively.\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations. One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members. Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community. They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community. However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one. Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations.\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization. Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue. Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale. In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain.\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation.\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and GIL BARAM\n\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace . These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” . However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms .\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\ntional Committee during the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages .\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states .\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 . In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" .\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability . Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions . Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both\nGIL BARAM\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking . These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures .\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them . To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization . Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards . These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order .\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security .\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms .\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Today the organization also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nit can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states . Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks . Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility . In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary .\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations . Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks . While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks . States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape .\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” . This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” . Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community . Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions . Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats . However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members\nor a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors . The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities .\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware . In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” .\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee , NotPetya , and WannaCry . After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.\nGIL BARAM\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China . Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops .\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. . Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people . The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat .\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats\nGIL BARAM\n\n## The Investigation\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" . A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. . The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy . This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy .\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them .\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations . Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities . In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.\nment to standing with its members in times of crisis . In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation . The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation .\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n## Conclusions\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\n\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution # Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research."

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran Palabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán Mots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran # Introduction On September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\".\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours. The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.\nHowever, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself”. How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it? And what is their potential effect in the international arena, especially during a time of fragmentation in the international cyber norms processes within the United Nations (UN)?\nThis paper argues that official public attribution (as defined by Rupp and Paulus 2023) in cyber diplomacy is pivotal in strengthening cyber norms and enforcing acceptable behavior in practice. Research suggests multiple reasons for such publicity, including deterring attackers and sending a message to both the offending and other nations that their hostile actions are identifiable and will face consequences. Though not yet codified, this shaping of conduct in the international arena enables the US and like-minded countries to influence the rules of conduct in the international domain, which might lead to the gradual emergence of unwritten yet increasingly recognized practice of official public attribution.\nBy publicly identifying states responsible for cyber misconduct, official public attribution not only promotes accountability but also fosters an international consensus on unacceptable behaviors. Official public attribution allows states to establish ‘facts on the ground' and implicitly or explicitly delineate acceptable and unacceptable conduct in cyberspace. While it is too early to look for evidence of behavior change in countries targeted by official public attribution, this proactive approach significantly contributes to the informal shaping of cyber behavior.\nThe paper begins with an analysis of UN cyber norms creation processes and official public attributions as means of signaling unacceptable international behavior. It then examines recent data on official public attribution patterns, and provides evidence supporting this growing practice. The data reveals a consistent pattern that, if it continues, could indicate the emergence of a new practical approach parallel to the norm-setting processes in the UN. It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n\n---\n\n## ## Conclusions\n\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na\nGIL BARAM\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.\nCyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution # Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Prof. Andrew Reddie for his valuable feedback on earlier drafts and the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab research assistants, and especially Courtney Smith, for their support in this research.",

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.\n\nResumen: Los debates internacionales con relacion al establecimiento y a la implementacion de normas de comportamento en el ciberespacio se han extendido durante mas de dos decadas.

    "Cyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\n\nRésumé: À l'échelle internationale, l'on discute de l'établissement et de la mise en œuvre de normes encadrant le comportement dans le cyberespace depuis vingt ans. Néanmoins, l'on ne définit pas tous un « comportement acceptable » de la même façon, ce qui entrave tout progrès dans la création de ces normes. Ces dernières années, les pays occidentaux ont adopté une stratégie visant à indiquer ce que l'on considère comme un comportement inacceptable en attribuant publiquement des cyberattaques et des intrusions. J'affirme que cet acte d'attribution publique fait office de pratique par laquelle un pays exprime sa désapprobation vis-à-vis d'un comportement inapproprié dans le cyberespace et sa condamnation de celui-ci. En outre, elle peut progressivement façonner les pratiques internationales, en tenant l'État qui est l'auteur de l'attaque pour responsable. Je m'y intéresse en (1) analysant de nouvelles données issues du European Repository of Cyber Incidents, qui font apparaître des schémas d'attributions publiques officielles au cours des années 2000 à 2023 et fournissant des explications à l'aide d'indications et de tendances, puis (2) en examinant la cyberattaque iranienne à l'encontre de l'Albanie en 2022 ainsi que les attributions publiques officielles qui en ont découlé comme étude de cas d'illustration. Je démontre comment l'attribution publique officielle répétée peut contribuer au développement d'une pratique commune qui indique une insatisfaction à l'égard d'un comportement spécifique. Face à l'essor des cyberattaques et intrusions soutenues par les États, cette pratique pourrait avoir un effet cumulatif.\n\nKeywords: policy relevant, norms, cyber conflict, public attribution, Albania, Iran\n\nPalabras clave: relevante para las políticas, normas, conflicto cibernético, atribución pública, Albania, Irán\n\nMots clés: pertinent sur le plan politique, normes, cyberconflit, attribution publique, Albanie, Iran\n\n# Introduction\n\nOn September 7, 2022, the Prime Minister of Albania, Edi Rama, delivered a scathing speech, announcing that Albania had decided to sever diplomatic ties with Iran. This decision followed the identification of the Iranian government as the perpetrator behind the cyberattacks against Albania in July, as described by the Prime Minister:\n\n\"This extreme response is fully proportionate to the gravity and risk of the cyberattack, which threatened to paralyze public services, erase digital systems, hack into state records, steal government intranet electronic communication, and stir chaos and insecurity in the country\" (Rama 2022).\n\nConsequently, Albania ordered all diplomatic representatives and staff of the Iranian embassy to leave the country within 24 hours (Aljazeera 2022). The US and the UK joined Albania in the official public attribution and imposition of responsibility on Iran, while Iran has consistently denied these accusations. The Albanian response is considered one of the most significant to a cyberattack to date (Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022; The White House 2022). By publicly disclosing this information through a senior figure like the Prime Minister, Albania, alongside the US, have been pioneering in public strategy and official attribution against countries responsible for cyberattacks.",
    "However, this publicity should not be taken for granted. For many years, offensive cyber operations were considered classified and something that states would not want to address in public. As General Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and CIA, said, “Even the phrase ‘offensive cyber operations' was classified. Not what it might mean, or what the targets might be, or what technologies would be involved—merely the phrase itself” (Lin and Zegart 2019, 5). How common is official public attribution? In what circumstances will states choose to use it?

It then analyzes the 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania and its subsequent official public attribution by Albania, the US, and its allies and its implications. Finally, the paper addresses the implications of this emergent practice and its potential impact on the future processes of implementing cyber norms.\n\n## Cyber Diplomacy, Norms, and Official Public Attribution\n\nIn recent years, there has been a notable expansion in the extent and magnitude of global cyberattacks and intrusions, and the rise of artificial intelligence is expected to contribute largely to this trend (Joshi 2024a; 2024b). The World Economic Forum has identified cyberattacks as a prominent global threat, cautioning that they are becoming more sophisticated and frequent (Feingold 2023). This surge in cyber threats has underscored the importance of establishing a shared understanding of norms of behavior in cyberspace and strengthening states' motivations to formulate cyber norms. Policymakers worldwide contend that the development of norms and confidence-building measures is essential to address global cybersecurity challenges. The United States, along with several nations such as G7 leaders, Australia, and Estonia, advocates for the establishment of guidelines promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace (Farrell 2015; Sherman and Morgus 2018; Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs 2019; Janofsky 2021; Price 2021).",
    "Why Do We Need Cyber Norms?\n\nEstablishing norms in cyberspace can enhance stability and predictability by delineating acceptable behavior and setting clear boundaries (Goldman 2020). Adhering to mutually agreed-upon norms allows states to minimize the risk of misinterpretation, miscalculation, and unintended escalation, thereby reducing potential conflicts arising from offensive cyber operations (Kreps and Schneider 2019; Lonergan and Lonergan 2023). Additionally, cyber norms can promote collaboration and facilitate information sharing among states, recognizing that the nature of cyber threats often transcends national borders, necessitating joint efforts to respond to and manage them effectively (Stevens 2012; Crowley and Gerstein 2014; Rowe 2018).\n\nThe nature and definition of norms have been subjects of prolonged debate among scholars in the field of International Relations (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; on norms for cybersecurity, see Finnemore 2011; Finnemore and Hollis 2016; 2020). One perspective characterizes norms as the outcomes of extended behavior patterns among community members (Ullmann-Margalit 1977, 8). Alternatively, norms are viewed as codes of conduct that prescribe what actions are allowed, forbidden, or required within a particular community (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Finnemore 2011). They can also be regarded as guiding principles dictating what actors should or should not do under specific conditions within their community (Deitelhoff and Zimmermann 2020). However, the question remains as to how many actors in the community must agree on a practice for it to be established as a global norm rather than a regional one (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998). Despite the informal nature of norms, they can carry substantial implications. A notable illustration is the historical reluctance to employ nuclear weapons in routine situations, primarily influenced by societal norms (see Tannenwald 1999; Rublee 2009). Norms also encompass an evaluative dimension; they can be used to criticize or endorse behavior in global politics and support sanctions in case of violations (Erskine and Carr 2018; on norms diffusion, see Erickson 2017; on the role of the military in promoting cyber norms, see Lonergan and Schneider 2023).\n\nFinnemore and Sikkink (1998) divide the life cycle of a norm into three phases: emergence, acceptance, and internalization (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 895). Initially, a norm must rise to the global agenda, facilitated by norm entrepreneurs—policymakers, experts, or interest groups with a vested interest in the issue (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 896--901; see also Hurel and Lobato 2018). Second, norm acceptance, or norm cascade, occurs as states or international organizations adopt the norm due to pressure from these norm entrepreneurs. Finally, after acceptance by state and international actors, the norm is implemented into policies and agendas, and these actors may themselves become norm entrepreneurs, promoting the norm on a regional or global scale (Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998, 902--905). In creating norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace, processes within the UN involving multiple stakeholders and private companies are crucial in establishing ‘what is acceptable and what is not' in this relatively new domain (Rogers 2014).\n\nIn the following paragraphs, I examine how the processes of cyber norms have been evolving within the UN and discuss the role of official public attribution as a practice for signaling what is deemed acceptable behavior in a period of norms fragmentation (Henriksen 2019, 6).\n\nBefore doing that, there is a need to clarify what acceptable behavior means. ‘Acceptable behavior in cyberspace' generally refers to the 11 norms for responsible state behavior in cyberspace, describing what states should and should not be doing in cyberspace ‘to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible, and peaceful ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) environment'. The UN's efforts seek to establish a framework for international cooperation, ensuring the security and",
    "GIL BARAM\n5\n\nstability of the digital environment. By fostering a collective understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace, the aim is to prevent the escalation and minimize the risks associated with cyber conflict (UN GGE, 2015).\n\n## Cyber Diplomacy: Norms Creation Processes within the UN\n\nTwo parallel groups within the UN have been discussing cyber norms¹: Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) and the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The work of the GGEs and OEWGs has focused on the following overarching topics: Existing and emerging threats; how international law applies in the use of ICTs; norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior of states; confidence-building measures; capacity building (see also CCDCOE 2016).\n\n## GROUP OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS\n\nInformation Security has been on the UN agenda since 1998, when the Russian Federation introduced a draft resolution on the topic in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly adopted it without a vote as resolution 53/70. Since then, several intergovernmental processes have been established to address the security and use of ICTs in the context of international security. Established by the UN General Assembly in 2004, the GGE on ‘Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’ has been pivotal in addressing threats to information security and exploring cooperative measures (The UN 2003). Over the years, the GGE has undergone six iterations, with four (2010, 2013, 2015, 2021) producing consensus reports (UNODA, n.d.). Each GGE built on the work of the previous ones, making significant cumulative progress on these issues (UNODA, n.d.). Despite the advantage of a limited number of states for achieving consensus, this consensus within a small group may not necessarily sway non-participating states (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022).\n\nThe 2015 GGE report marked a significant milestone, establishing 11 consensus norms on responsible state behavior in cyberspace (UN GGE, 2015). These norms, divided into limitations on states and good practices, aimed to ensure international stability in cyberspace. The report set restrictions on states, such as refraining from activities that harm global critical infrastructure, and proposed positive practices like international information sharing (Rõigas and Minárik 2015).\n\nThe 2015 report was of great significant as it was the first time the GGE members achieved agreement on a large number of norms, confidence-building, and capacity-building measures. As the report highlighted: “The 2015 Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security examined existing and potential threats arising from the use of ICTs by States and considered actions to address them, including norms, rules, principles and confidence-building measures. In addition, the Group examined how international law applies to the use of ICTs by States. Building on the work of previous Groups, the present Group made important progress in those areas [...] the present report significantly expands the discussion of norms” (UN GGE, 2015, 2). However, subsequent sessions, such as those in 2016–2017, faced disagreements over interpretations of self-defense and international law, impeding the development of new norms (Davis and Lewis 2019; Kulikova 2021).\n\nDuring the group’s mandate, there were several significant international events that might have created tensions and roadblocks within the cybersecurity domain. These include: The 2016 Democratic National Committee Hack: This high-profile cyberattack, allegedly carried out by Russian actors, targeted the Democratic Na\n\n¹As of this writing, only the OEWG established by resolution 75/240 is active, with the GGE having concluded its final session.",

The Russian Cyberattack on Ukrainian Power Grid (2015): In late 2015, a cyberattack attributed to Russia targeted Ukraine's power grid, causing widespread power outages (Wheelwright 2016).\n\nNo new cyber norms were established since 2015. However, the 2021 GGE report expanded and further explained existing norms (Douzet, Géry, and Delerue 2022). The 2021 GGE report addressed several key aspects related to cybersecurity norms and attribution. (1) Foundations for Attribution: The report discussed the importance of the type of attribution and its broader context in attributing cyberattacks to specific actors. (2) National Frameworks: The report provided guidelines for developing national frameworks for cybersecurity, aiming to synchronize these frameworks among nation-states. The report's efforts to clarify and expand existing norms, as well as provide guidance on attribution and national frameworks, aimed to enhance international cooperation and address challenges in the cybersecurity domain (Gavrilović 2021; GGE on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, 2021).\n\n## OPEN-ENDED WORKING GROUP\n\nIn December 2018, through resolution 73/27, the UN General Assembly established an Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG). The OEWG is open to all UN member states, and private actors are welcome to join informal sessions and discussions, although their involvement is limited due to objections from some states (Painter 2021; UNODA 2021).\n\nThe Group began its work in 2019 and held intersessional consultative meetings with industry, civil society, and academia. The group adopted a report by consensus at its final session in March 2021 (A/75/816). The final report and its recommendations were endorsed in General Assembly decision 75/564 (UNODA, 2021; United Nation 2021). In 2020, the General Assembly through resolution 75/240, established a new five-year OEWG. This OEWG is meeting regularly through 2025 (UNODA, n.d). Despite the challenges and differing perspectives, the OEWG continues to serve as a platform for discussions and negotiations on cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, with the aim of reaching a consensus by 2025.\n\nThe group is mandated to \"further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behavior of States; to consider initiatives of States aimed at ensuring security in the use of information and communications technologies; to establish [...] regular institutional dialogue with the broad participation of States; to continue to study, with a view to promoting common understandings, existing and potential threats in the sphere of information security, inter alia, data security, and possible cooperative measures to prevent and counter such threats, and how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States, as well as confidence-building measures and capacity-building\" (UNODA 2021).\n\n## Challenges to Cyber Norms Creation and Implementation\n\nThe process of implementing cyber norms within the UN has experienced many challenges. The divergent views between prominent global actors, notably the US, China, and Russia, pose significant challenges to consensus. The US emphasizes cybersecurity, focusing on protecting data and preventing unauthorized access, while China and Russia advocate for 'information security,' emphasizing state control over online content to maintain political stability (Kello 2024; on the ASEAN countries, see Tran Dai and Gomez 2018; Tan and Ang 2022). Furthermore, Russia's perspective is shaped by the post-Cold War era and its diminished global influence, leading to initiatives challenging Western cybersecurity notions (Ristolainen 2017; Claessen 2020). Despite differences, a noteworthy observation is that both",
    "GIL BARAM\n\nthe Kremlin and the White House share a common interest in enhancing cyberspace stability and diminishing incentives that promote risk-taking (Grigsby 2017, 12). These differing perspectives complicate efforts to agree on global cyber norms and governance structures (Grigsby 2017; Kello 2021; On norm sabotage, see Schneider 2021).\n\nCyber powers like China, Russia, and emerging other BRICS² nations have expressed concerns over the prevailing global cyber governance framework. They argue that the current structure, which emphasizes technical infrastructure as power arrangements and positions the internet as a battleground for clashing values, disadvantages them (DeNardis 2014). To address this issue, the BRICS have established several cooperative forums, including the IBSA (India, Brazil, and South Africa) Dialogue Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (Rebello 2017). Additionally, China has independently organized initiatives such as the World Internet Conference to advocate for its interests in shaping internet governance norms and standards (Tiezzi 2014). These efforts reflect the BRICS' desire to reshape the conceptual underpinnings and power dynamics of global cyber governance to better align with their strategic priorities as rising cyber powers.\n\nWhile not as actively engaged in multilateral discourse as China and Russia, Iran and North Korea have consistently defied internationally accepted norms across various domains. These two nations have taken a more confrontational stance, emerging as significant violators of global norms and rules. Their actions have often disregarded established principles and standards upheld by the broader international community, reflecting a disregard for diplomatic conventions and a willingness to challenge the existing normative order (Katagiri 2024, 289).\n\nAnother example of these disagreements is the varied and sometimes even contradicting definitions of cyber governance and sovereignty in cyberspace. The Western bloc, including the US and EU, advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and protecting fundamental rights in global cyber governance. In contrast, China and Russia lead initiatives through the UN and international forums to establish norms and codes of conduct, emphasizing cyber sovereignty. Furthermore, while some countries, like Japan and Canada, advocate for reinforcing existing frameworks, others, such as China, push for innovative standards, including those focused on data security (DiploFoundation 2023).\n\nThis dichotomy presents a critical decision-making juncture: should states expand upon the established norms or venture into new territories to reshape the cyber normative landscape? This clash of perspectives underscores the complexity of reaching a global consensus on cyber norms (Pohle and Thiel 2020; Ciglic and Hering 2021; Raymond and Sherman 2024).\n\nPublic attribution is another area of disagreement. The 2015 GGE report (Article 28f), the resolution initiating the OEWG (Article 1.2), and the concluding OEWG report all acknowledge that simply identifying the source of an attack may not suffice for official attribution, emphasizing the need for concrete evidence to support accusations. However, there is a clear divide in the stance of major players: the US, its NATO allies, and some key players in the internet industry tend to participate in collective official attribution by publicly naming and criticizing the accused parties. Russia criticizes this method as a pseudo-legal tactic, where a group of nations blames another without revealing the proof and advocates for attributions based on solid evidence. Furthermore, the 2021 GGE report advises caution in officially attributing cyberattacks, noting the complexity of the process and suggesting that such prudence may prevent misunderstandings and escalating tensions among nations (Digital Watch, n.d.). The section that follows provides a brief overview of the practice of official public attribution and explores how\n\n²Intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

    "it can be used as a proactive policy instrument for signaling unacceptable cyber behavior.\n\n### Official Public Attribution: Enforcing Norms in Practice\n\nIdentifying and attributing cyberattacks pose significant challenges to states (Egloff 2020a; Egloff and Dunn Cavelty 2021; Egloff and Smeets 2021). Existing research on the attribution problem has primarily focused on the complexities introduced by anonymity and the subsequent challenges faced by defenders in responding to attacks (Tsagourias 2012; Rid and Buchanan 2015; Broeders, De Busser, and Pawlak 2019; Baram 2023a). Using intelligence sources in the attribution process introduces another concern about potential compromise and endangerment, creating a delicate balance between transparency and credibility (Lindsay 2015). In order to foster credibility, scholars examined models for institutions that will make attribution more than one nation pointing its finger at an adversary (Mueller et al. 2019, 107).\n\nThis decision to publicly attribute a cyberattack involves a complex interplay of technical, political, legal, policy, and national interest considerations (Lin 2017; Eichensehr 2020). Despite the intricate nature of the decision, there has been a growing trend in recent years, with states increasingly publicly attributing cyberattacks (Alperovitch 2018; Kaushik 2019; Egloff 2020a; 2020b; Schroeder 2022). While official public attribution can serve as a deterrent, highlighting a state's commitment to holding perpetrators accountable (Baliga, Bueno De Mesquita, and Wolitzky, 2020), it also carries risks (Bateman 2022). States should weigh the strategic calculations, geopolitical factors, and potential challenges associated with public attribution, considering its potential impact on deterrence, international cooperation, and their overall image in the global cyber landscape (Egloff, 2020b).\n\nOn July 20, 2023, Secretary-General António Guterres, presented the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace.' Among others, the policy brief includes a section titled ‘Tackling the extension of conflict and hostilities to cyberspace.' One of the recommendations of this section was to “establish an independent multilateral accountability mechanism for malicious use of cyberspace by States to reduce incentives for such conduct. This mechanism could enhance compliance with agreed norms and principles of responsible State behaviour” (Guterres 2023, 27). This call reflects the concerns regarding the lack of official international accountability mechanism, in which public attribution might be one of the diplomatic proactive policy instruments for decision-makers to choose from. As Lewis (2022) notes: “ In order to impose consequences (or create accountability), attribution is needed as justification to the international community and to convince political leaders of the need for action” (Lewis 2022, 4). Furthermore, credible attribution is crucial for a politically acceptable response to malicious cyber actions, ensuring acceptance by domestic audiences, allies, and the global community (Lewis 2022, 10; on accountability mechanisms in cyberspace, see Pawlak, 2023, 2024). Official public attribution clarifies which actions are deemed unacceptable, reinforces these norms through the threat of international scrutiny, and encourages collective action. First, it aids in norm clarification. By publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions, it becomes clear which actions are unacceptable in cyberspace, thereby establishing firmer boundaries for digital conduct. Second, it reinforces these behavior. When a state is exposed as the perpetrator, international scrutiny and potential condemnation apply pressure, encouraging adherence to established norms and deterring future violations through diplomatic, economic, or political repercussions (Carvin 2021). Third, this unified stance—especially when several states are conducting the official public attribution together—can enhance the credibility of official attribution efforts and present a unified front against cyber threats (Lee 2023). However, certain states may hesitate to join these coalitions due to conflicting geopolitical interests with other members",
    "or a preference for an independent approach to handling cyber incidents (on international attribution mechanisms, see Shany and Schmitt 2020; Mueller et al. 2019).\n\nConcurrently, discussions about norms in diplomatic settings, such as multilateral debates at the UN, are largely controlled by a select group of major powers and influential middle powers, which also find themselves divided over the norms that should direct the actions of both state and non-state actors (Katagiri 2021, 3). The US and its allies often face criticism that their accusations of other states engaging in malicious cyber activities are hypocritical and lack credibility, as their own actions are perceived as self-serving. Research indicates that democracies tend toward public credit-claiming and public attribution, while less democratic countries often deny such activities (Baram 2023b).\n\nSeveral examples from the past few years illustrate this kind of criticism: In August 2023, China accused US intelligence agencies of a cyberattack on the Wuhan Earthquake Monitoring Center, claiming evidence was left behind in the form of unique and complex malware (Ikeda 2023). In June 2023, China's government dismissed the findings of a U.S. cybersecurity firm, Mandiant, that attributed widespread cyberattacks on hundreds of public agencies, schools and other targets around the world to Chinese-affiliated hackers, and argued they were “far-fetched and unprofessional” (AP News 2023). In July 2021, China accused the US of conducting cyberattacks on Chinese institutions over the past 11 years, following similar accusations by the US against China. This exchange exacerbates tensions, with Chinese officials describing US allegations as politically motivated smears. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said at a press briefing that these allegations are “borne out of nothing” and “solely serve the political purpose of smearing and suppressing [China]” (Feng 2021).\n\nThe issue of hypocrisy and self-serving motives poses challenges to the influence and credibility of public attribution. When states engage in public attribution while simultaneously conducting their own offensive cyber operations, it could undermine the moral authority of their accusations and weakens the normative power of public attribution. This credibility gap can lead to a cycle of mutual accusations and denials, potentially eroding the effectiveness of official public attribution as a tool for promoting responsible state behavior in cyberspace. Furthermore, the perception of self-serving motives can cause other states and the international community to view public attributions with skepticism.\n\nWhile criticisms of hypocrisy and self-serving motives are valid, the overall benefits of public attribution—such as promoting transparency, deterrence, coalition building, and norm setting—underscore its importance in the international cybersecurity landscape.\n\nIn the following section, I present data regarding official public attribution based on the new European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC) dataset. The goal of this section is to enable linking the scholarship on cyber norms and official public attribution to the policy debate by examining how common official public attribution is in practice. I then examine the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the public reactions to it. Taken together, these data suggest an emerging pattern that could lead to a new practical approach used by states, alongside the norm-setting and implementation processes in the UN.\n\n### Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\n\nHaving discussed the historical context of cyber norms, their current status (see also Jacobsen and Valeriano 2023) and the practice of official public attribution, let us now turn to the data and contemporary case study to understand governments' use of official public attribution. This section is used to shed light on the phenomenon of official public attribution in the broader context of norms discussions within the UN. While it is too early to measure the potential effect of the practice of official",
    "Cyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1. Official public attributions by year 2000-2023\n\npublic attribution on states' behavior, there is a lot to gain from examining the available data on it and identifying current trends. This section serves as an exploratory section aimed at examining what are the main trends when it comes to states conduct of official public attributions.\n\n## Data: The Practice of Official Public Attribution\n\nThe use of the EuRepoC dataset and analysis of official public attributions from 2000-2023 demonstrate how such actions are increasingly used as proactive policy instruments for shaping cyber behavior. This practice—by clarifying unacceptable behaviors highlights the evolving landscape of global cyber diplomacy.\n\nTo examine the practice of official public attribution, I collected data from the EuRepoC_Global_Database_1.1 dataset and the variables attribution basis and end_date. The attribution basis variable has the following categories: Media-based attribution; Receiver attributes attacker; IT-security community attributes attacker; Attacker confirms; Contested attribution; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by receiver government/state entity; Attribution by international organization; Attribution by EU institution/agency (EuRepoC Data, 2023).\n\nI included only cells with the value - Attribution by receiver government. In total, there were 203 public attributions by state governments for the years 2000-2023.³ Figure 1 shows that from 2007 onward, there was a noticeable uptick, with seven incidents that year. A marked increase occurred in 2011 when the count rose to 14 publicly attributed cyberattacks. 2016 and 2017 saw the highest recorded number of cyberattacks attributed by governments, with 28 and 24 incidents accordingly. This might be because in these years, several highly public cyberattacks were conducted, such as the Russian cyberattack against the US Democratic National Committee (Whyte 2020), NotPetya (Greenberg 2018), and WannaCry (Chen and Bridges 2017). After this peak, there was a decrease, but the numbers remained relatively high, especially in comparison to the early 2000s. There was a drop to nine in 2020, in 2021, the count decreased to eight and stayed the same in 2023. The year 2022 saw a rise to 16 incidents, a significant increase from the previous year. Although it is too early to identify a trend, official public attribution is a practice that increasingly aligns with states efforts to implement cyber norms as governments seek to assert their stances in the international arena.\n\n³Cyberattacks with an unknown attacker’s identity were not included.",
    "GIL BARAM\n\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\nFigure 2. Official public attributions by state 2000-2023\n\nAfter seeing that official public attribution is happening and growing in the past years, we now move to examine who are the main countries conducting it. Figure 2 shows the 15 countries reporting the highest numbers of official public attributions. Out of 41 countries, the United States stands out with 67 attributions, highlighting its active role in addressing cyberattacks. South Korea, with 16 official public attributions, and Ukraine, with 13, also demonstrate significant engagement in the cyber domain. In South Korea's case, it is probably due to its ongoing rivalry with North Korea, and Ukraine has been public due to the Russian cyber threats. The \"Multiple\" category, accounting for 35 public attributions, refers to instances of collective attribution by several countries. Countries with advanced cyber capabilities, such as Israel and Germany, have recorded six and five public attributions, respectively. Australia's count of six suggests its robust stance on cyber threats. In Australia's case, it has especially been attributing cyberattacks coming from China (Packham 2019; Joint Statement Minister for Home Affairs and Minister of Defence 2021; Evans 2023). Autocratic countries like China and Russia, each having a single public attribution, imply that these countries are less willing to admit their weakness by revealing they have been attacked. This diversity highlights the global reach of cyber conflicts and the varying degrees to which nations acknowledge and respond to these threats within the international community.\n\nThe data discussed in the section highlights the practice of official public attribution of cyberattacks by state governments from 2000 to 2023. It shows an increasing trend in publicly attributing cyberattacks to specific actors, especially by the United States, South Korea, and Ukraine, among others. It helps understand how the practice of repeated public attributions could contribute to shaping behaviors internationally. This is important as it suggests that such public attributions are not just reactive measures but also proactive instruments for policymakers for influencing the development of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.\n\nAs the data show, the majority of public attributions have come from the US, EU actors, and their allies. This imbalance reflects the current geopolitical landscape and the advanced technical capabilities of these nations. The predominance of Western official public attributions could potentially hinder the formation of a global consensus. Nations outside the Western bloc might view these attributions with skepticism, seeing them as instruments to advance Western interests rather\n\n4There can also be other reasons not to attribute and attribution can be done privately. In this article, I examine only the public facing reactions of states. On the less public options to responding to cyberattacks and intrusions, see Brown and Fazal 2021.",
    "Cyber Diplomacy through Official Public Attribution\n\nthan neutral assessments of cyber behavior. Furthermore, the ability to conduct credible attributions is closely tied to a nation's technical capabilities and resources. This disparity means that technologically advanced nations have a disproportionate influence in shaping states' behavior through attribution. Less technically advanced nations may find themselves unable to participate effectively in this norm-setting process, further skewing the practice towards the perspectives of more capable actors.\n\nThe next section discusses the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and the subsequent official public attributions by Albania's Prime Minister, as well as the joint public attribution by the United States and its allies. This case exemplifies the emerging trend observed in the data.\n\n## Official Public Attribution in Practice: The Iranian Cyberattack against Albania in 2022\n\n### Attack Description and Immediate Impact\n\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania started in 2021, with hackers infiltrating an unsecured government computer system. From this initial entry point, the attack broadened to include the networks of the Albanian intelligence service, police, border patrol, and various other governmental bodies. In mid-2022, Iranian cyber operatives orchestrated a targeted cyberattack on Albanian government networks. This multifaceted operation, from May to June 2022, involved techniques like lateral movement, network reconnaissance, and credential harvesting. The attackers' primary targets were Albania's digital services and critical infrastructure, leading to substantial disruptions. Subsequently, in July 2022, the attackers deployed ransomware within the networks, accompanied by an anti-Mujahideen E-Khalq message on affected desktops (CISA 2022).\n\nThe hackers disrupted public services by shutting down government websites and compromised digitized government services. They also accessed and disseminated sensitive information, including the identities of undercover Albanian intelligence officers, director of intelligence emails, and classified data. (Grossman 2023, 28-30; Lyngaas 2022). Leaked data included names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people (Higgins 2023). The impact of the attack was significant, compelling the Albanian government to also halt the Total Information Management System, a border control system responsible for tracking individuals entering and exiting the country. Additionally, online public services for citizens were suspended in response to the cyber threat (Semini 2023).\n\n### Why Iran was Targeting Albania to Begin With?\n\nAlbania is believed to have been targeted by Iran in retaliation for providing shelter to thousands of members of the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group. The MEK, designated as a terrorist organization by Iran, has been residing in a fortified camp in Manez, Albania, since their evacuation from Iraq in 2016. By hosting the MEK, Albania put itself at odds with Tehran. In 2013, Albania agreed to host thousands of MEK members after the US and the UN requested asylum for the group. The MEK holds annual political summits, presenting itself as a government-in-exile, which Tehran views as a direct challenge to the Iranian regime.\n\nFollowing the MEK's arrival, Iran increased its covert activities in Albania, including deploying intelligence operatives under diplomatic cover to gather information on the MEK. Between 2018 and 2021, Albania expelled several Iranian diplomats",
    "GIL BARAM\n13\n\nand citizens, accusing them of espionage and illegal activities related to the MEK (Oghanna 2023; Zaimi 2022).\n\n## The Investigation\n\nHired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with \"high confidence\" to \"actors sponsored by the Iranian government,\" identifying MEK as the \"primary target\" (Higgins 2023; Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022). A message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel after Albania declined to close the MEK camp said, \"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?\" [...] \"As long as MEK exists, so do we,\" the hackers warned. (Higgins 2023). The message in the ransom image indicates that the MEK was the primary target behind their attack on the Albanian government (Microsoft Threat Intelligence 2022).\n\nFollowing a thorough investigation, the Albanian government, with the aid of international experts, identified the perpetrators as Iranian state-sponsored hackers. This led to a severe diplomatic fallout, including Albania's expulsion of Iranian diplomats within 24 hours, marking a significant moment in cyber-diplomacy (Ajazeera 2022; Rama 2022). This action, a rare instance of a nation directly and officially attributing a cyberattack and taking immediate diplomatic actions, highlighted the growing importance of publicity in the international arena and the willingness of states to escalate their cyber diplomacy arsenal into a diplomatic crisis. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, condemned the decision as \"unfounded,\" adding that it \"only serves the American and Israeli conspiracy (Zaimi 2022).\n\nAfter Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran's foreign ministry stated that the charges leveled against its country would \"give full support to a terrorist sect,\" [referring to the MEK], which \"continues to play a role as one of America's tools in perpetrating terrorist acts, cyberattacks\" against Iran. This implicitly served as an admission of guilt by Tehran for the cyberattacks as well as confirming the reason behind them (Zaimi 2022).\n\n## International Responses to the Cyberattack and Official Public Attribution\n\nIranian state actors have been widely attributed as the perpetrators of these offensive cyber operations: In the US, the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) jointly issued a cybersecurity advisory outlining the details of the operations (CISA 2022). Private companies like Microsoft and Mandiant also named Iran as the perpetrator behind this cyberattack.\n\nIn a December 2022 briefing, White House National Security Council coordinator, John Kirby, addressed the attacks:\n\n\"The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack against our NATO Ally, Albania. We join in Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable for this unprecedented cyber incident. The United States will take further action to hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent for cyberspace\" (The White House 2022).\n\nFollowing the cyberattack, NATO and its member states took concrete actions to assist Albania. The alliance condemned the cyberattack, pledging support to bolster Albania's cyber defense capabilities (Miller 2022). In a show of solidarity, NATO released a statement supporting Albania, underscoring the organization's commit\n\n5On Albania cybersecurity strategy, see Tiri and Aliaj 2023. For the broader examination of the effect of the cyberattack, see Biberaj et al. 2022.",
    "ment to standing with its members in times of crisis (NATO 2022). In November 2022, NATO Deputy Secretary General, Mircea Geoană, addressed the cyberattack during his speech at the Prague Cyber Security Conference:\n\n> “Just a few weeks ago, the North Atlantic Council strongly condemned the recent cyberattack on Albania's national information infrastructure [...] Albania and other Allies attributed the attack to Iran. This was an example of NATO Allies coming together, sharing information and responding with a collective response” (Geoană 2022).\n\nThe United Kingdom also condemned the cyberattack, with its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) attributing the attack to Iranian state-linked actors. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly denounced Iran's “reckless actions” and affirmed the UK's support for its “valuable partner and NATO ally” (Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office 2022; Ribeiro 2022).\n\nIn the aftermath of the Iranian cyberattack against Albania, the Albanian government found itself at a crossroads, contemplating the invocation of NATO's Article 5, which would have marked the first instance of such action by a NATO member state. Article 5 stipulates that an attack against one member be considered an attack against all, triggering collective defense measures (Prucková, n.d.). However, Albania ultimately chose to avoid escalating the situation (Miller 2022). The deliberations within the Albanian government regarding the potential activation of Article 5 brought to the forefront an ongoing debate on whether cyberattacks warrant a NATO collective defense response and subsequent cyber retaliation (Miller 2022).\n\nFollowing the Iranian cyberattack, the U.S. Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) conducted its first-ever defensive cyber operation in Albania: “U.S. Cyber Command's CNMF deployed a Hunt Forward team in collaboration with Albania to conduct network defense activities alongside the partner nation to identify, monitor, and analyze adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures.” Hunt Forward Operations are defensive missions that allow countries to better understand the shared threats and to enhance the security of critical networks that the U.S. allies, and partners depend on. The U.S. cyber operators provided technical findings to the Government of Albania, enabling it to take steps toward bolstering their network defense. Those insights have proven invaluable to defending the United States from outside aggression and malicious cyber behavior in cyberspace (Cyber National Mission Force Public Affairs 2023).\n\nThe Iranian cyberattack on Albania in 2022 showed how vital was international collaboration in cyber defense and enhanced norms to condemn such state-sponsored attacks. The fact that many countries—and not just Albania—chose to publicly attribute the cyberattack publicly shows that more countries are willing to take a stand against state-sponsored cyberattacks.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this article, I examine an emerging phenomenon whose impact cannot currently be quantified—public attributions of unacceptable behavior in cyberspace. Nonetheless, it warrants consideration not as a substitute for establishing norm processes within the UN frameworks but rather as a process that functions in a complementary and concurrent manner for states to publicly show their disapproval. Over time, this strategy of official public attribution may yield a cumulative effect on states behavior, thereby contributing significantly to the broader discourse.\n\nThis article has emphasized the vital function of official public attribution, not just as a reactive tool but also as a proactive policy instrument allowing na",
    "GIL BARAM\n15\n\ntions to sculpt and sway the direction of acceptable behavior. The data showed that official public attribution is a growing practice, as the US leads this practice along with other Western countries. The 2022 Iranian cyberattack against Albania has demonstrated official public attribution in action, thereby enriching the discourse on the evolution of cyber norms with practical and policy relevant insights.\n\nThe Albanian case was not a ‘stand-alone’ one. The US and its allies are continuing to use official public attribution to show their disapproval of certain activities. For example, in May 2024, Poland and the Czech Republic have accused Russian cyber spies of targeting their government and infrastructure networks. Both countries claimed the attacks occurred around the same time Russian hackers targeted the German government. The hackers exploited a Microsoft Outlook vulnerability to gain access, and the extent of the compromised data remains unknown. The same month Germany accused Russia of breaking into the emails of Germany’s Social Democrats, the leading party in its governing coalition (Charlish, Florkiewicz, and Pearson 2024; Heine and Lopatka 2024).\n\nWestern democracies, led by the United States and its allies, have been at the forefront of recognizing and employing official public attribution as a diplomatic tool. This recognition extends to international bodies such as the UN GGE and the OEWG, which have discussed the role of attribution in their deliberations on responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The significance of this growing recognition lies in its potential to reinforce agreed-upon cybersecurity norms. As more states and international actors acknowledge official public attribution as a legitimate practice, it strengthens the collective ability to hold malicious actors accountable and deter future cyber aggressions. However, it is important to note that this recognition is not universal. Some states, particularly those often publicly blamed, contest its legitimacy and effectiveness.\n\nIn this context, it is important to address the following question: How can this emerging practice of de facto norm formation be transformed into a more institutionalized form of soft law that can solidify over time? One option is to integrate public attribution practices with existing norm development processes within the UN (as Secretary-General Guterres said in the ‘Policy Brief on A New Agenda for Peace’). This could involve incorporating public attribution data into discussions and negotiations on cyber norms. Another possible approach is to advocate for the inclusion of public attribution as a recognized tool in the enforcement of international cyber norms. Additionally, states could explore the potential for developing international agreements or treaties within UN frameworks that formalize the role of public attribution in cyber norm enforcement (as has already been discussed in the GGE 2021 report). Finally, states with cyber resources, like the US, could offer technical assistance and resources to help other states develop the necessary infrastructure and expertise for effective cyber attribution (as it is already doing in Ukraine and other countries).\n\nFuture research could offer a comparative examination of several case studies looking at the different ways official public attribution is done by different states and how this ongoing practice is varied across cyberattack type, perpetrator’s identity, etc.\n\nThe implementation of the current cyber norms and the development of future ones will inevitably be shaped by rapid technological advancements, such as those in artificial intelligence, and significant geopolitical events, including ongoing conflicts and regional tensions. A coordinated global effort is indispensable in establishing and upholding responsible cyber behavior among nations.",

However, differences in what constitutes 'acceptable conduct' have hindered progress in forming these norms. In recent years, Western countries have adopted a strategy to signal what is considered unacceptable behavior by publicly attributing cyberattacks and intrusions. I argue that this act of official public attribution serves as a practice for countries to express their disapproval of inappropriate cyberspace behavior and condemnation and can cumulatively shape international practices, holding the attacking state accountable. I explore this by (1) analyzing new data from the European Repository of Cyber Incidents, which shows patterns of official public attributions for the years 2000-2023, providing exploratory directions and trends, and (2) examining the Iranian cyberattack against Albania in 2022 and its subsequent official public attributions as an illustrative case study. I demonstrate how repeated instances of official public attribution can contribute to the development of a common practice that signals dissatisfaction of a specific behavior. As state-sponsored cyberattacks and intrusions are on the rise, this practice could have an accumulative effect.",
