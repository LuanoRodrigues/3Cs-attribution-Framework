He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 6 December 2022\nRevised 7 September 2023\nAccepted 17 October 2023\n## KEYWORDS\nCyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot\n## Introduction\nAs the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in\nCONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au\n© 2023 Chatham House\nfocus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n## Literature review\nIn 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the\nmanagement of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to (Weber 2018). This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' (Brands 2014, 1) and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes (Riordan 2019, 10--13). Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective' (Goldman 2023, 168). This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n## Results and discussion\n### Pivot to Asia\n### What was pivot?\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that\nanother 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East (Belasco 2009). In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East (Clinton 2011). Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015 (Lofflmann 2016). It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area (Dolan 2022).\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods (McCausland 2014). The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that\nChina was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area (Clinton 2010). China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies (Tow 2016). The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010 (Wang 2016). The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office\nPresident Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a\nconcern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats (Lilli 2020). Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012)\nBetween 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and\nits citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)”\nChinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms (Austin and Gady 2012). This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar (Farwell and Rohozinski 2011; Zetter 2014). This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly (Lilli 2020). In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised (Barrinha and Renard 2017). The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013 (Schmitt 2013). The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly (Kizekova 2012). The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016)\nAt the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘ ... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure (Panetta 2012). By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing\nnetworks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive\nOrder 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world (Marks 2019). The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information (Nakashima 2015). The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government (Rushe 2015).\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace (Zheng 2015). The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage,\nacts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace (Broeders 2021). The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion\nExamining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin. His wisdom was invaluable.\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY\n#\n# Disclosure statement\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

Burt School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, Canberra ## ABSTRACT President Obama was a cyber president. He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 December 2022 Revised 7 September 2023 Accepted 17 October 2023 ## KEYWORDS Cyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot ## Introduction As the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in CONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au © 2023 Chatham House focus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n## Literature review In 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the management of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to. This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes. Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective'. This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n## Results and discussion ### Pivot to Asia ### What was pivot?\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that another 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East. In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East. Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015. It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area.\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods. The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that China was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area. China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies. The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010. The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office President Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats. Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012) Between 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and its citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)” Chinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms. This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar. This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly. In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised. The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013. The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly. The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016) At the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure. By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing networks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive Order 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world. The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information. The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government.\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace. The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage, acts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace. The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion Examining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin. His wisdom was invaluable.\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # # Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied."

      "## Literature review In 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the management of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult."

      "### The cyber landscape as Obama took office President Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues."

      "### Obama's first term (2009--2012) Between 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on."

      "### Obama's second term (2013--2016) At the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools."

Burt School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, Canberra ## ABSTRACT President Obama was a cyber president. He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.",
    "## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 December 2022 Revised 7 September 2023 Accepted 17 October 2023 ## KEYWORDS Cyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot ## Introduction As the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.": "Much has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in CONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au © 2023 Chatham House focus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.",
    "## Literature review In 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the management of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.": "Cyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to. This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes. Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective'. This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.",
    "## Results and discussion ### Pivot to Asia ### What was pivot?": "President Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that another 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East. In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East. Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015. It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area.\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods. The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that China was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).",
    "### Why was the pivot adopted?": "The timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area. China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies. The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010. The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.",
    "### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?": "In both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.",
    "### The cyber landscape as Obama took office President Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.": "Shortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats. Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.",
    "### Obama's first term (2009--2012) Between 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.": "The Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and its citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)” Chinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms. This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar. This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly. In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised. The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013. The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly. The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.",
    "### Obama's second term (2013--2016) At the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.": "Shortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure. By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing networks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive Order 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world. The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information. The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government.\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace. The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage, acts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace. The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion Examining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin. His wisdom was invaluable.\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # # Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

Burt School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, Canberra ## ABSTRACT President Obama was a cyber president. He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 December 2022 Revised 7 September 2023 Accepted 17 October 2023 ## KEYWORDS Cyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot ## Introduction As the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in CONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au © 2023 Chatham House focus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n## Literature review In 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the management of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to. This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes. Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective'. This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n## Results and discussion ### Pivot to Asia ### What was pivot?\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that another 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East. In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East. Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015. It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area.\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods. The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that China was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area. China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies. The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010. The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office President Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats. Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012) Between 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and its citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)” Chinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms. This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar. This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly. In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised. The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013. The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly. The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016) At the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure. By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing networks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive Order 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world. The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information. The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government.\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace. The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage, acts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace. The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion Examining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin. His wisdom was invaluable.\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # # Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).",

He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 6 December 2022\nRevised 7 September 2023\nAccepted 17 October 2023\n## KEYWORDS\nCyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot\n## Introduction\nAs the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in\nCONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au\n© 2023 Chatham House\nfocus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n## Literature review\nIn 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the\nmanagement of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to (Weber 2018). This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' (Brands 2014, 1) and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes (Riordan 2019, 10--13). Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective' (Goldman 2023, 168). This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n## Results and discussion\n### Pivot to Asia\n### What was pivot?\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that\nanother 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East (Belasco 2009). In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East (Clinton 2011). Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015 (Lofflmann 2016). It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area (Dolan 2022).\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods (McCausland 2014). The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that\nChina was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area (Clinton 2010). China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies (Tow 2016). The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010 (Wang 2016). The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office\nPresident Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a\nconcern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats (Lilli 2020). Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012)\nBetween 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and\nits citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)”\nChinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms (Austin and Gady 2012). This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar (Farwell and Rohozinski 2011; Zetter 2014). This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly (Lilli 2020). In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised (Barrinha and Renard 2017). The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013 (Schmitt 2013). The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly (Kizekova 2012). The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016)\nAt the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘ ... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure (Panetta 2012). By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing\nnetworks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive\nOrder 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world (Marks 2019). The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information (Nakashima 2015). The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government (Rushe 2015).\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace (Zheng 2015). The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage,\nacts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace (Broeders 2021). The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion\nExamining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin.

He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY\nReceived 6 December 2022\nRevised 7 September 2023\nAccepted 17 October 2023\n## KEYWORDS\nCyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot\n## Introduction\nAs the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in\nCONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au\n© 2023 Chatham House\nfocus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n## Literature review\nIn 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the\nmanagement of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to (Weber 2018). This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' (Brands 2014, 1) and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes (Riordan 2019, 10--13). Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective' (Goldman 2023, 168). This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n## Results and discussion\n### Pivot to Asia\n### What was pivot?\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that\nanother 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East (Belasco 2009). In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East (Clinton 2011). Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015 (Lofflmann 2016). It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area (Dolan 2022).\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods (McCausland 2014). The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that\nChina was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area (Clinton 2010). China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies (Tow 2016). The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010 (Wang 2016). The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office\nPresident Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a\nconcern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats (Lilli 2020). Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012)\nBetween 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and\nits citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)”\nChinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms (Austin and Gady 2012). This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar (Farwell and Rohozinski 2011; Zetter 2014). This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly (Lilli 2020). In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised (Barrinha and Renard 2017). The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013 (Schmitt 2013). The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly (Kizekova 2012). The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016)\nAt the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘ ... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure (Panetta 2012). By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing\nnetworks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive\nOrder 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world (Marks 2019). The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information (Nakashima 2015). The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government (Rushe 2015).\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace (Zheng 2015). The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage,\nacts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace (Broeders 2021). The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion\nExamining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin.

Burt School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, Canberra ## ABSTRACT President Obama was a cyber president. He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n## ARTICLE HISTORY Received 6 December 2022 Revised 7 September 2023 Accepted 17 October 2023 ## KEYWORDS Cyber diplomacy; Sino-US relations; President Obama; pivot ## Introduction As the globe becomes more digitised and connected through cyber technology, states are grappling with the development of effective cyber strategies and the creation of coherent and constructive cyber strategies. Scholars have begun to turn their attention to the identification of the ways in which traditional diplomacy and strategy in international relations, on a range of issues, have impacted the approach taken to cyber diplomacy. The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in CONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au © 2023 Chatham House focus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n## Literature review In 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the management of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to. This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.\nWhat this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes. Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.\nThis article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective'. This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n## Results and discussion ### Pivot to Asia ### What was pivot?\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that another 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East. In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East. Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015. It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area.\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods. The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that China was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area. China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies. The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010. The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office President Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats. Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012) Between 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and its citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)” Chinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms. This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar. This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly. In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised. The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013. The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.\nRussia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly. The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016) At the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure. By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing networks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive Order 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world. The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information. The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government.\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace. The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage, acts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace. The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.\nConclusion Examining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin. His wisdom was invaluable.\nJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY # # Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s)."

Burt School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of New South Wales, Canberra ## ABSTRACT President Obama was a cyber president. He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.\n\n---\n\n## ### The cyber landscape as Obama took office President Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\n\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats. Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.",

The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.|### Obama's second term (2013--2016) At the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace.

The most important strategy of Obama's time in office was the pivot to the Asia-Pacific, yet the impact it had on cyber diplomacy between the US and China has been under studied.\n\nMuch has been written about the notable shift in President Obama's approach to China in his first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). There are myriad explanations for this. There was a change in secretary of state, a change in leadership in China, and domestic factors and policy priorities that all impacted on the focus of foreign policy during Obama's terms in office. In the latter stages of Obama's first term, there was a shift in\n\nCONTACT Sally Burt s.burt@adfa.edu.au\n\n© 2023 Chatham House",
    "focus globally as well as for the United States itself, with a move away from the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' towards the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region. This is an important element that is worth analysing.\n\nIn terms of the cyber elements of the relationship between the United States and China, there was also a shift. From a cooperative and collaborative approach to dealing with cyber issues that marked Obama's first term, to a more aggressive and competitive approach in his second, President Obama was a cyber president. He was acutely aware of issues related to cyberspace and global competition and attuned to identifying and responding to the potential threats posed by external actors in cyberspace. Several studies have explored the developments in the US's cyber strategy and policies during the Obama administration, noting his proactive stance and the change in the US's approach to cyber issues as a national security priority. There is a need to combine our understanding of both traditional and cyber diplomacy to develop a more complete picture of Sino-US relations in the Obama presidency and examine the impact that the pivot to Asia had on the US's cyber diplomacy with China From this examination we can also see how cyber diplomacy needs to be aligned with a state's broader Grand Strategy in order to work with other diplomatic efforts to achieve states' interests and national security.\n\nThe approach to the research undertaken and presented in this article was to examine public documents, speeches, media releases and other information gathered from US government open sources. These sources provide an understanding of the approach taken towards relations between the US and China. The change in the approach to the relationship between Obama's first and second terms becomes evident from this analysis. As that change occurs, the study explores the timing of other events and aspects of the relations between China and the US and the rhetoric of Xi Jinping and Obama that impacted on the cyber diplomacy between the two. In this way, the effect of the pivot strategy can also be seen.\n\nExploring these broader complexities in the relationship sheds light on the path taken by policymakers and strategists in relation to the development of Grand Strategy, cyber strategy and other strategies towards China during the Obama presidency. This can provide lessons for future policy-makers about how to effectively integrate cyber diplomacy into Grand Strategy to achieve broader national security outcomes.\n\n## Literature review\n\nIn 2011, President Obama announced that the US was making a strategic pivot from its focus on the Middle East and the ‘war on terror' conflicts to the Asia-Pacific region. While the United States had been occupied in other parts of the globe, China had quietly grown its influence and power in the Asia-Pacific. Obama, then, made the decision to return the US's focus to its nearer region to reverse, or at least stem, this trend. Renato Cruz De Castro (2013) examined the pivot, its impacts and its implications for US relations, as have others (see, for example, Warren and Bartley 2021; Weissmann 2019 and Gonçalves de Oliveira 2021). Garrison and Wall (2016) explored Obama's bilateral relationship with China in the context of this broader rebalance to Asia. They found that there was more continuity in Obama's strategies for engagement with China than change from previous administrations since the end of the Cold War. They also noted that the",
    "management of friction in that bilateral relationship was a key challenge to be addressed. Meijer and Jensen (2017) went further in examining the increasing complexity in Sino-US relations resulting from the number of areas of interaction between the two -- what the authors referred to as ‘global dynamic density'. They argued that the US--China relationship is increasingly integrating in areas such as the economy and commerce, as well as through cultural and educational exchanges. This complexity makes the development of Grand Strategy more difficult.\n\nCyber technology and policy have added new areas for strategic competition and international relations and this has also added complexity to the development of Grand Strategy. There is a need, though, to think about the interaction with cyber diplomacy that is lacking from these types of studies. In the modern era, and as a particularly prominent aspect of Obama's presidency, cyber relations need to be accounted for in any study of the conduct of US relations in this era. Some have argued that President Obama lacked a Grand Strategy.\n\nValentin Weber argues that a Grand Strategy combines political, military and economic elements of international relations and creates an accompanying narrative to justify a state's behaviour. The US's cyber strategy, Weber argues, should be tied to its Grand Strategy to assist in directing it towards the same ends. Weber then goes on to argue that the US, under President Obama, had no Grand Strategy in his international relations and so there was nothing that cyber strategy could be tied to (Weber 2018). This article will argue that the Grand Strategy developed by Obama was centred on the pivot to the Asia-Pacific region and a renewed strategic focus in that direction.\n\nHal Brands argues that ‘Grand Strategy is a notoriously slippery concept' (Brands 2014, 1) and the term is often used but less often defined. He goes on to define Grand Strategy as the ‘purposeful and coherent set of ideas about what a nation seeks to accomplish in the world, and how it should go about doing so' (3). This is a useful definition of the pivot strategy that Obama adopted in 2011. The idea was that the US would continue to provide leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. It would also work to demonstrate its continued economic strength and value amid discussions of its decline and the clear rise of China. According to Rebecca Lissner (2021), Grand Strategy can be impacted by military interventions that demonstrate changes in the distribution of capabilities. The US involvement in conflicts in the Middle East may have provided such a revelation. As the Obama administration could see the changing capabilities of powers in the Asia-Pacific and saw those capabilities in a new light (with the implications of cyber power), there was a recognised need to shift the focus of US foreign policy and strategic thinking geographically.\n\nEugenio Lilli (2020) built on Weber's work by adding the institutional component of policy development into the analysis of US cyber strategy. In his article ‘President Obama and US Cyber Security Policy', Lilli discusses the difference between policy and strategy and presents a careful exploration of the policy initiatives Obama implemented during his time in office. Lilli credits Obama's personal leadership with the great progress made in US cyber policy that led to the creation of a more coherent and effective government structure for the handling of cyberthreats and policies as well as recognition of cyber's role within the national security context. This was a useful addition, along with the previous studies mentioned, on the road to understanding the place of cybersecurity policy and strategy within the broader framework of government and national security in the cyber age.",
    "What this article seeks to add to the debate and scholarship is an examination of the connection between Obama's shifting approach to the US--China relationship and cyber diplomacy and the pivot in Grand Strategy. This will provide insight into the framing of the institutional development of cyber leadership within the US government and how the interaction between the different elements of the diplomatic relationship impacts the formulation of cyber strategy to achieve a state's Grand Strategy. The argument presented here is that the more competitive approach that Obama took towards China in cyber diplomacy in his second term was a result of the impact in this shift in Grand Strategy.\n\nTo understand the relationship between different elements of the Grand Strategy, we need to be clear on our definition of cyber diplomacy and the focus of the discussion relating to it. Some recent scholarship on cyber diplomacy has focused on diplomacy in the sense of what has been termed cyberwarfare -- that is, attempts to avoid cyber conflict or war in cyberspace. A lack of clearly defined rules of engagement and debate about the applicability of Laws of Armed Conflict in cyberspace have been the focus of such studies (see, for example, Lancelot, 2020; Liff 2012; Muresan 2017). The other element of cyber diplomacy that has been canvassed in the literature, particularly in relation to Sino-US relations, is the development of cyber governance in the international system and the regulation of cyberspace (see, for example, Cai 2018; Riordan 2019; Shen 2016). These are important elements of multilateral diplomacy but limit the concept of diplomacy to its role in the avoidance of war.\n\nWhat has come to be seen over recent years, though, and is particularly highlighted by studying Sino-US relations through the Obama years, is that there needs to be consideration of cyber diplomacy in a much more general sense. Diplomacy involves negotiation and relations between nations in a range of different settings and not just in the avoidance of war. Diplomacy in its most meaningful sense is the creation and furthering of deep relationships between states.\n\nIn this article, then, we will be exploring the concept of cyber diplomacy in the context of Shaun Riordan's work. He states that diplomacy includes relations on state-based issues as well as global issues. Cyberspace issues also cover both state-based and international issues. The threats that actors deal with in cyberspace also interact with the physical environment. Therefore, there is a need to use diplomacy in both the area of cyber issues and in traditional relations between nations in order to be most effective and achieve the best diplomatic outcomes (Riordan 2019, 10--13). Others have also begun to examine this broader context of cyber diplomacy, such as Valeriano et al. (2018) and Barrinha and Renard (2017). To ignore one set of factors over the other in examining the Obama administration's relations with China risks missing crucial elements that help us understand the shift in approach during the course of his presidency. This will also be true of relations between nations in an ongoing sense as cyber diplomacy is here to stay.\n\nAdam Segal (2014) has also provided an overview of cyber aspects of diplomacy between the US and China, but his work was produced in 2014, during the Obama administration. A slightly later work by Harold, Libicki, and Cevallos (2016) is an excellent examination of cyber diplomacy in US--China relations during the Obama period, but it does not contextualise this in its relationship with traditional diplomatic issues or the Grand Strategy of the pivot.",
    "This article is seeking to build on this body of literature with a comparison of the first and second terms of the Obama presidency and the differences in the approach towards China in cyber diplomacy. It will show that to understand this shift, the broader context of Sino-US diplomacy, and particularly the impact of the pivot to Asia, must also be understood. Other factors may also assist in explaining the shift in approach. There was mounting frustration that resulted from US attempts to cooperate with China on issues such as cyber espionage and corporate theft which led to little noticeable change in Chinese behaviour. The change in response, though, came prior to some serious engagement on intellectual property theft at Sunnylands in 2013 when Obama and Xi discussed the issue. The context of events occurring beyond cyberspace and cyber diplomacy, and more in the nature of traditional diplomacy, needs to be understood to explain the timing more effectively. Looking at the Grand Strategic context of the pivot to Asia, events in the South China Sea, dealings with North Korea and the greater and broader strategic threat that the US faced from China being addressed through the pivot, provide a clearer picture of the shifts in cyber diplomacy in Obama's second term.\n\nChina's actions and approach to its relations with the US, particularly in cyberspace, cannot be ignored when considering reasons for the shift on the US side. Fred Cate's chapter in Lindsay et al.'s work China and Cybersecurity: Espionage, Strategy and Politics in the Political Domain (2015) provides an insightful analysis of the role China plays in influencing the United States and its cybersecurity policies. Cate explores the difficulties in being able to create appropriate incentives for proper conduct in cyberspace. Some of the inconsistent elements of the approach may be explained by experimentation being used in an attempt to find and apply those appropriate incentives.\n\nEmily Goldman, in her chapter Revamping Diplomacy for Strategic Cyber Competition (2023), notes that there is a need to develop a more proactive and adaptable diplomatic approach to cyber issues in international relations. Using cyber as a tool of national power requires its integration more fully into the Grand Strategic narrative. Cyber power needs to be ‘leveraged toward a coherent strategic objective' (Goldman 2023, 168). This article hopes to contribute to the debate through an exploration of how this has been done in the past and learning from the operation of US cyber diplomacy with China in the context of the Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Pivot to Asia\n\n### What was pivot?\n\nPresident Obama announced in 2011 that the United States was going to make a strategic pivot towards the Asia-Pacific. From 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the US and its military had been consumed with conflict in the Middle East. On 25 September 2001, secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld announced the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom which began the ‘war on terror'. On 7 October 2001, the war in Afghanistan commenced with the US and UK troops bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda training camps. In March 2003, the war was expanded into Iraq. By the time President Obama took office, troop numbers were escalating in Iraq and Afghanistan. In December 2009, there were around 50,000 US troops in Afghanistan and Obama announced that",
    "another 30,000 would be sent. At the same time there were over 130,000 troops in Iraq. Overall, these conflicts were keeping roughly 200,000 US troops occupied in the Middle East (Belasco 2009). In late 2011, President Obama announced the pivot to the Asia-Pacific and this aligned with troop withdrawals and drawdowns from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn October 2011, US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, published an article in Foreign Policy explaining that the centre of global politics in the twenty-first century would be Asia and not the Middle East (Clinton 2011). Shortly after that, President Obama announced that the United States would pivot its national security strategy to the Asia-Pacific and away from its entanglements in the Middle East. In a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011 the president stated, ‘[a]fter a decade in which we fought two wars that cost us dearly, in blood and treasure, the United States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region' (President Obama 2011a). At the time of the announcement of this shift in strategic focus, there was much debate about the US's ability to make this pivot in terms of its available resources and the practical matters of allocation of those resources geographically. There was also speculation about China being the target of this pivot and the response the Chinese government was likely to have to a renewed push for US leadership of the region (see, for example, Cruz De Castro 2013; Lieberthal 2011; Schiavenza 2013).\n\nThe pivot (and later ‘rebalance') to Asia represented a significant restructure of US strategy that impacted all elements of US national security, from economics and trade to the military, political and diplomatic relations. It was an announcement of US Grand Strategy. US policies on a range of these related issues had varying levels of alignment with that Grand Strategy and the specific vision that President Obama laid out as his intention for the pivot. These different policies have been given varying levels of attention in the analysis by scholars that has occurred in the decade since the pivot was announced. The impact that this strategic shift had on the US approach to China more generally has been researched, but its cyber diplomacy with China specifically has been given far less attention in the literature to date. This article seeks to address this lack of attention by examining those impacts.\n\nAs a new focus for US Grand Strategy, the pivot led to deepening diplomatic relationships with key players in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2011, the US began engaging with ASEAN more deeply through the appointment of a resident ambassador to the organisation. This was followed by the establishment of a strategic partnership between ASEAN and the United States in late 2015 (Lofflmann 2016). It also saw deeper ties developed with Japan, Australia and South Korea through bilateral strengthening of alliance relationships. In terms of building military strength and capability in the region, Obama announced in his speech to the Australian parliament, in November 2011, that 2500 US Marines would be based in Australia on rotation (President Obama 2011b). The US also increased its maritime presence in the Pacific. In mid-2016, elements of the Third Fleet were assigned to operate with the Seventh Fleet. This allowed the increased tempo of freedom of navigation exercises in the South China Sea, testing China's resolve in the disputed area (Dolan 2022).\n\nThe pivot also saw the US increase its economic investment in the Asia-Pacific region. It grew as an export market for US goods (McCausland 2014). The Trans-pacific Partnership (TPP) was the central trade policy of the pivot. Lofflmann (2016) argues that the TPP was designed with the intention of arresting US economic decline and the perception that",
    "China was the more important economic partner for sustained economic growth into the future for regional powers. The agreement focused on reducing tariffs, and other trade barriers while establishing regulation for the protection of intellectual property (a hot button issue between the US and China) and ensuring the US was ‘writing the trade rules in the fastest-growing region in the world, the Asia-Pacific, as opposed to having China write those rules for us' (Obama quoted in Lofflmann 2016).\n\n### Why was the pivot adopted?\n\nThe timing of the pivot coincided with China's more aggressive rhetoric and activities in the South China Sea (SCS). As China developed a more assertive stance towards these territorial disputes, the United States was confirmed in its perception of the China threat in the Asia-Pacific region. In May 2009, Vietnam and Malaysia had submitted territorial claims over parts of the SCS to the United Nations. In July 2010, secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made a speech in Hanoi affirming the US's interests in the dispute and to ensuring freedom of navigation through the area (Clinton 2010). China did not respond well to the speech which was seen as a challenge to its sphere of influence. Through 2011, the disputes grew and incidents between ships in the SCS, as well as other actions by claimant states, heightened tensions in the area (Cruz De Castro 2013). It was in November 2011 that Obama announced the strategic pivot to the Asia-Pacific. With the US's intentions made clearer, there was a need to support that move with action and diplomacy to match. This coincided with several key events in the cyber diplomacy between the US and China and the hardening stance of Obama in this space. These connections are the subject of the analysis of this article.\n\nDebate about the efficacy and design of the pivot centred on its ‘anti-China' messaging and focus. The initial analysis of the pivot amplified the most tangible aspects of the strategy, being the military transfers and policies (Tow 2016). The pivot, however, as a Grand Strategy, was much more than just a military force redeployment. The broader diplomatic, legal and international relations implications took longer to come to fruition and were also less measurable, and so were less of a focus during the early years of the pivot. An important milestone that also coincided with the pivot was China overtaking Japan as the world's second largest economy in 2010 (Wang 2016). The economic motives and elements of the pivot, then, were just as -- if not more -- important. The pivot was designed to reassert US leadership in the Asia-Pacific to avoid allowing China to take charge of the region, militarily, diplomatically or economically.\n\n### How does the pivot link to cyber diplomacy?\n\nIn both the literature examining the pivot as US Grand Strategy and in the scholarship relating Grand Strategy to cyber strategy, thorough analysis of the impact of the pivot on Sino-US cyber diplomacy has been overlooked. This article seeks to fill this gap and conduct an analysis of how the change in US Grand Strategy during the Obama administrations impacted on Sino-US cyber diplomacy during the first and second terms.\n\n### The cyber landscape as Obama took office\n\nPresident Barack Obama was sworn in as president of the United States on 20 January 2009. At that time, threats in the cyber landscape were only loosely identified as a",
    "concern. At that point, the biggest threat identified in cyberspace was the theft of commercial and industrial information and secrets through cyber espionage. China and Russia were identified as the biggest players in the cyber espionage game, with China suspected of being the most prominent protagonist (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The identified threat was mainly viewed through the lens of cybercrime and cyber espionage (President Obama 2009a). President Obama's first State of the Union Address to Congress, in February 2009, identified cyberspace as a twenty-first century threat along with pandemics, poverty, terrorism and nuclear proliferation (President Obama 2009b). The threat, then, was recognised but not seen as a particular priority, rather, as one issue to be addressed among others. There were higher priorities both internationally (the ‘war on terror') and domestically (passing Obamacare) that limited the government's ability to focus more intently on cyberthreat issues.\n\nShortly after taking office, President Obama ordered a Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review (CCPR), which led to the development of a Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. That review identified the need to better coordinate the US's cybersecurity activities, reporting and capabilities. President Obama had come to office recognising the need to do more in the cyber area. The government had not established governance structures that allowed for the effective identification and handling of cyberthreats (Lilli 2020). Between 2009 and 2011, the Obama administration created several key positions that allowed for the coordination of cyber activities and increased the visibility of US cyber policies. This period, then, can be seen as the establishment phase.\n\n### Obama's first term (2009--2012)\n\nBetween 2009 and 2011, and towards the end of this establishment phase, the United States government started to focus more on the national security impacts of cybersecurity. The State of the Union Addresses for both 2010 and 2011 demonstrated the domestic policy agenda focus, as cybersecurity did not rate a mention in either address. In the 2010 speech, Obama said, ‘[o]ur most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis', not a development of new cybersecurity strategies or policies (President Obama 2010). The theme of the 2011 speech was the economy and the need for Americans to transition to a more tech-based economy rather than relying on steel works and other industries that were big employers of the past. The president did talk about the need for innovation and for Americans to ‘reinvent themselves' in the context of employment outcomes and future economic growth (President Obama 2011a). Healthcare reform, the need to resolve economic crises and ending the war in Iraq were given greater priority at that time (President Obama 2010, 2011a). It was only later in 2011 that the national security apparatus of the US government prioritised cyber as a major issue for the national interest and global great power competition, as a result of the CCPR. This reflected not Obama's neglect of the area, but the need to establish some underpinning principles and understanding of the issues relating to cyber policy and strategy as a foundation to build on.\n\nThe Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review, undertaken in May 2009, identified the need for a cybersecurity coordinator office to be based at the White House. Howard Schmidt was appointed to this position in December 2009. The role was designed to coordinate policies, the budget and responses to cyberthreats faced by the United States and",
    "its citizens (President Obama 2009a). The coordinator was part of both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council, demonstrating recognition of the connection between cyber issues in the economy and national security interests (Office of the White House Press Secretary 2011).\n\nThe White House position was not the only one created. On 1 June 2009, it was announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was establishing two new cybersecurity positions within the department: an assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications and a counselor to the under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD). The deputy under secretary for NPPD also served as director of the National Cybersecurity Center. This dual role was created to assist in the development and implementation of a coherent cyber strategy within DHS (Department of Homeland Security 2009).\n\nAs a way of coordinating military responses to cyberthreats, a Cyber Command was stood up. In mid-2009, the then secretary of defense produced a memo that directed the establishment of a US Cyber Command. USCYBERCOM became operational in May 2010. This followed from the groundwork that had been laid by the Cyber Review and by the reorganisation of the cyber forces within the separate services of the US armed forces through 2009 (USCYBERCOM Website). The National Military Strategy of 2004 had established cyberspace as a domain of warfare (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2004). The next step was to develop a command structure to allow the full utilisation of that domain as well as the defence of it. That command structure was developed through the creation of USCYBERCOM in 2009. The military and national security threat posed by China and other states in cyberspace was recognised and a response was being developed. When Obama came to office with a commitment to improving US cyber capabilities, it allowed the Department of Defense to focus on delivering these initiatives.\n\nOther countries were also taking action on cyber issues. In March 2011, China released its Defence White Paper that outlined the need for cyber superiority in order to achieve greater parity in the military arena. It stated that China needed to ‘maintain its security interests in space, electromagnetic space and cyber space.' It also stated: “The PLA has expanded and made profound preparations for military struggle, which serve as both pull and impetus to the overall development of modernization. It intensifies theoretical studies on joint operations under conditions of informationization, advances the development of high-tech weaponry and equipment, develops new types of combat forces, strives to establish joint operation systems in conditions of informationization, accelerates the transition from military training under conditions of mechanization to military training in conditions of informationization, presses ahead with implementation of the strategic project for talented people, invests greater efforts in building a modern logistics capability, and enhances its capabilities in accomplishing diversified military tasks in order to win local wars under the conditions of informationization, so as to accomplish its historical missions at the new stage in the new century. (Information Office of the State Council, PRC 2011)”\n\nChinese leaders identified the need to increase China's technological capacity in cyberspace as it was lagging behind other major powers in this area. Priority was given to advancing its modernisation reforms (Austin and Gady 2012). This had important implications for China's actions and strategy in relation to Taiwan and the South China Sea and in terms of its strategic competition with the United States.",
    "In late 2010 and early 2011, the Stuxnet attack on Iran was made public. The exposure of what was labelled by some scholars as the first ‘digital weapon' was speculated on as having opened the door for future cyberwar (Farwell and Rohozinski 2011; Zetter 2014). This created a new threat perception in the United States and a new imperative in the government's response to cyber issues. Although the US was involved in the Stuxnet attack and so aware of the potential of these kinds of cyberattacks, having Stuxnet revealed very publicly created this awareness on a much broader scale. The notion that, although cybercrime and espionage were a great concern to the US economy and commercial enterprise, there was now the potential for an even more damaging threat being posed by other states to US national security. Stuxnet, which targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure, demonstrated the ability for states to attack each other's critical infrastructure with the potential to devastate, not just economies, but populations and the functioning of society on a grand scale (US Senate 2010). It created a precedent for other states to use these kinds of weapons against each other.\n\nBy 2011, then, the United States had information about the potential threat that China's adoption of its Defense White Paper and increasingly aggressive stance posed. Along with the implications of Stuxnet and the weaponisation of cyberspace, cyber issues became more prominent on Obama's domestic and international agenda. This led to a number of initiatives and policies from the United States and the Obama administration. In February 2011, Christopher Painter assumed the role of coordinator for cyber issues in the US State Department. The extent to which cyber issues needed coordination because of their infiltration into all aspects of government, national security and society was beginning to be recognised and government structures developed accordingly (Lilli 2020). In May 2011, the United States released its first International Strategy for Cyberspace. The connection between diplomacy on cyber issues and on other issues was beginning to be recognised (Barrinha and Renard 2017). The Obama administration was alive to the fact that cyber conflict and disagreements needed a fuller diplomatic response and engagement from the White House and State Department as well as the military and National Security Agency.\n\nThe annual report to Congress by the Office of National Counterintelligence Executive in October 2011 was the first time the entire report focused on cyber espionage and Chinese, as well as Russian, actions in using cyber means to undertake espionage activities (Office of the National Counter Intelligence Executive 2011). The Russian cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007 had led to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, a group of international cyber experts. The group was called together to examine the applicability of international law to cyberspace. This resulted in the Tallinn Manual, the collective wisdom of this group, being published in 2013 (Schmitt 2013). The consensus was that international law was applicable in cyberspace. The threat that Russia had created through its use of cyber means to coerce its neighbour was being recognised and responded to. It was also adding to the complexity of the US's international relations. The US was also beginning to recognise the dangers of the lack of international norms in cyberspace and particularly for states in the use of cyber capabilities to attack other states (US Department of Defense 2011). Without established rules of the game, the strategic landscape looked very dangerous. The US's attempts to establish the rules, though, were challenged.",
    "Russia and China were also acting in the United Nations in order to establish a rival vision of the internet and cyberspace to that proposed by the US. In April 2010, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Nations Organisation. According to its website, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a group of states that came together to establish a more formal agenda for their shared view of the global environment. Founded in 2001, the group includes China, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and several more observer states. The signing of the MoU with the UN demonstrated a level of credibility for the SCO that may have troubled states opposed to its goals. In 2009, the group signed an agreement relating to information security, and in 2011, some members submitted a draft International Code for Information Security to the UN General Assembly (Kizekova 2012). The Chinese and like-minded states had taken the initiative on norm-setting in the international community with a view to ensuring that norm development worked for this group rather than the traditionally Western-dominated norm-development of the past. Although this draft was rejected, it did not stop the challenge from the SCO, which culminated in the establishment of the Open-Ended Working Group to work in parallel with the UNGGE years later.\n\nAs the dangers and vulnerabilities that were being established in cyberspace were being fitted into a broader diplomatic framework of drawing competing visions for world order, and particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, a Grand Strategic plan was being developed.\n\n### Obama's second term (2013--2016)\n\nAt the beginning of President Obama's second term in 2013, the threat landscape had become a lot clearer in relation to cyberspace. From the beginning of his first term, Obama had identified cybersecurity as a key priority. He spent the duration of his first term implementing findings and recommendations of the Comprehensive Cyberspace Policy Review. By the beginning of his second term there were numerous positions and a national infrastructure for cybersecurity that recognised this priority. These positions and infrastructure allowed for the development of a coherent response to the cyberthreat posed by China and the establishment of a coordinated whole-of-government approach as well as the opportunity to use a range of more assertive diplomatic tools.\n\nShortly after the pivot was announced, President Obama, in his 2012 State of the Union address, stated: ‘ ... [t]o stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I've already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.' (President Obama 2012) Secretary of defense, Leon Panetta, also made a speech in October 2012 to Business Executives for National Security in which he discussed the ‘cyber Pearl Harbor' threat that could cause physical destruction and loss of life through attacks on critical infrastructure (Panetta 2012). By the 2013 State of the Union address, the threat had been ‘rapidly growing'. For the first time, the president was willing to focus publicly on threats such as cyber identity theft, economic espionage and also attempts to gain the capability to attack US critical infrastructure. There was a recognised need for the United States to develop more sophisticated and efficient ways to defend itself against these cyberthreats. The focus in 2013 was on securing",
    "networks, ‘increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy' (President Obama 2013).\n\nThe administration was focused on responding to economic espionage and was prepared to speak publicly about the impact and implications of the threat to US companies and economic prosperity. The national security implications of what China was trying to achieve through its activities of corporate theft, and how it could be used to further ambitions of cyber power, began to influence the US's diplomacy with China and its response to the economic espionage. A clearer picture was also emerging of who the US's adversaries in this space were and their strategies for outwitting the United States in the global competition for power. It appears that the focus remained an economic one. The US was in economic decline and the president's instinct was to protect US jobs and businesses from cyberthreats. This aligns with the pivot's focus of presenting the US as a leader and reassuring states in the Asia-Pacific region that it still had a robust economic future.\n\nIn February 2013, Mandiant, a US cybersecurity company, released a report that identified the ‘advanced and persistent threat' posed by cyberattacks originating in China targeting US firms and government agencies. It named Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as being responsible for targeting US organisations to gather economic intelligence and proprietary information (Mandiant Report 2013). These revelations and very public identification and recognition of the threat China posed in cyberspace were followed a few months later by the US Department of Defense's report to Congress, in which the department also attributed cyber espionage activities it had detected as originating in China. This was the first time that the innuendo about who was responsible was replaced by actual attribution to China (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission 2013).\n\nIn May 2014, the United States Department of Justice indicted five members of China's PLA on 31 counts relating to various offences. The indictment alleged that they had hacked into and stolen very sensitive information and corporate secrets from six US companies. The nature of what was stolen led to the first charges of this kind being applied to state actors. A media release about the indictment quoted James Comey, the FBI Director as follows: ‘[f]or too long, the Chinese government has blatantly sought to use cyber espionage to obtain economic advantage for its state-owned industries.' The United States attorney general, Eric Holder, also stated that ‘[t]his Administration will not tolerate actions by any nation that seeks to illegally sabotage American companies and undermine the integrity of fair competition in the operation of the free market' (US Department of Justice 2014). A clear shift in diplomatic approach being used by the Obama administration in relation to cyber diplomacy with China had occurred. The indictment and statements made in its announcement named and blamed China publicly. Until this point, language used by the president and his advisors had been very deliberate and diplomatic in avoiding naming China directly in the threat of cyber espionage and attacks being posed to the United States.\n\nIn November 2014, North Korea engaged in a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The attack cost Sony millions of dollars and led to the release of personal details of Sony employees and embarrassing emails from its executives' accounts. Christopher Painter, the US State Department's coordinator for cyber issues at the time, in testimony to Congress, stated that the attack was destructive and motivated by coercion in a way that set it apart from other cyberattacks. It led to President Obama making Executive",
    "Order 13694 in April 2015 outlining US deterrence measures against cyberattacks through the ability to respond with sanctions (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). The Obama administration was developing its diplomatic arsenal to respond to the China challenge.\n\nThe ability for another state to attack a US company in a way that caused large scale damage shattered the confidence of the leadership and business world (Marks 2019). The implications of the attack were realised at the highest levels of the US government and moves were made to address potential vulnerabilities. There was also a shift in focus towards diplomatic outreach and activity in cybersecurity. A need to work with partners around the globe was recognised. The national security implications of cyber diplomacy had come to the fore and the need to build capability and activity in this space was identified. The pivot strategy had, as a main pillar, deeper engagement with allies and partners. The US was working with allies on cyber issues, including with states such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, as well as ASEAN. The focus was on establishing ‘regional cyber confidence building measures' (Testimony of Christopher Painter 2015). Engaging bilaterally and multilaterally with the region created a coalition of like-minded states that lent support to the US's vision of the future of cyberspace.\n\nAnother attack came in late 2014 and into early 2015 when a Chinese cyber unit successfully breached the security framework of the Office of Personnel Management and accessed government personnel files including sensitive security clearance information (Nakashima 2015). The files of some 4 million government employees were accessed and the breach was only discovered after security upgrades were made to the system following an earlier breach. Using the data, China was potentially able to identify covert US operatives across the globe. The nature, sophistication and outcome of this attack were a wake-up call for the US. The expectation is that government systems would be the most secure networks. This successful attack on a highly sensitive government system was disconcerting for the US government (Rushe 2015).\n\nThe severity and types of cyberattacks being conducted on US companies and government departments and agencies was increasing and the persistent and more threatening nature of the security environment was becoming obvious by 2015. The US's national security was being severely challenged. By 2015, the US State Department was involved in a range of bi- and multilateral fora relating to cybersecurity. The range of threats being posed to the United States had broadened, as had the number and type of adversaries the US was recognising in the cyber world. In 2015, the US Department of Defense released its cyber strategy and acknowledged the need for a whole-of-government approach to these challenges. It also emphasised the need for international alliances and cooperation for deterrence in cyberspace (Zheng 2015). The Department of Defense's strategy, then, was aligned to the pivot's main goals.\n\nIn terms of Sino-US relations on cyber issues, 2015 saw a number of key events. In September, Xi Jinping made a state visit to the United States. At a press conference after the summit, President Obama made it clear that China needed to stop engaging in corporate espionage to steal commercial information and secrets from US companies. China had agreed not to steal intellectual property for commercial gain (as opposed to national security purposes), but Obama was clear that the US would use all the tools at its disposal to protect American companies and so put China on notice. President Obama also made a number of concessions during the conference that were, no doubt, offered as a face-saving mechanism for Xi after the criticism Obama levelled at China over cyber espionage,",
    "acts in the South China Sea and its record on human rights. Obama recognised China, along with the US, as a cyber power and noted that it needed to be treated as such. He also announced increased travel and tourism between the US and China and a programme to encourage Americans to learn Mandarin. The president also reiterated the US's strong commitment to the One China Policy and cited three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act to attest to that commitment. Comments were also made about the US recognising Tibet as part of China (President Obama and President Xi 2015).\n\nAt the 2015 press conference, a number of shared interests were also identified. China and the US agreed to cooperate on clamping down on corporate cyber espionage and other cybercrimes. Both China and the United States welcomed the July 2015 report by the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Information Security (UNGGE) and the work being done towards establishing norms of behaviour and addressing other critical issues relating to cybersecurity (US Department of State 2015). The UNGGE's final report in 2015, that was endorsed by the UN General Assembly, established 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. This built on an earlier report from the group in 2013 that established a consensus among international law experts that international law applied to activities in cyberspace (Broeders 2021). The US had championed these measures in an attempt to establish some regulation of states' uses of cyberspace in international relations.\n\nDuring Xi's visit to the US, a joint high-level mechanism for communication on cyber issues was established and its first meeting scheduled. The US and China stated their commitment to denuclearising the Korean Peninsula peacefully and encouraging Iran's denuclearisation also. Expansion of commercial opportunities, Afghanistan and the Ebola crisis were also identified as areas for cooperation in Sino-US relations (President Obama and President Xi 2015). There was a clear focus, though, on the threat that China posed to the United States' economic welfare through its cyber espionage activities that disadvantaged US companies. A broader threat to the liberal, free market economic world order had also been identified. The extent and seriousness of the threat, combined with the realisation of the vulnerabilities of the state resulting from the impacts and consequences of corporate espionage and hacking into stored data, led to the more assertive tactics the US used towards China.\n\nObama's statements on cooperation with China and outlining its strengths, and the agreement that resulted from Xi's visit, could be interpreted as being softer on China than the other activities, such as the more pointed attribution, threat of sanctions and indictments. This does not mean that the president had an inconsistent approach. When taken in the context of the other challenges being made to China in the non-cyber world, such as the increased freedom of navigation exercises that the US was undertaking in the SCS, these face-saving statements and actions could be seen as an attempt to ensure that assertive responses to Chinese actions did not lead to escalation or conflict. It is important to examine the broader diplomatic context and not examine one or the other in isolation.\n\nPresident Xi, at a joint press conference held with Obama after their summit held in Sunnylands, California in 2013, shortly after Xi had become president of China, stated that media coverage with a focus on cybersecurity issues would lead an onlooker to believe ‘that the issue of cybersecurity is the biggest problem in the China-U.S. relationship' (President Obama and President Xi 2013). As the later press conference in 2015 shows, cybersecurity and cyber diplomacy need to be contextualised in the broader range of issues addressed in bilateral relations.",
    "Conclusion\n\nExamining the US's strategic pivot to Asia, in the context of cyber diplomacy and relations with China involving interactions in cyberspace, demonstrates that cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from more traditional areas of diplomacy, either in the conduct or development of national strategy. By focusing exclusively, or even with just too much attention, on one issue, a skewed view of the diplomatic relationship can be presented. Isolating out strategies and determining Grand Strategies as if these single issues were the sum total of the diplomacy being conducted leads to a dangerous oversimplification of Grand Strategy development and implementation. Cyber issues and relations with other states need to be considered in the broader context of the relationship and a state's overall Grand Strategy. Establishing separate and isolated cyber strategy, policies and diplomacy leads to the risk of inconsistent diplomacy and potentially damaging signalling through interactions that are not aligned to Grand Strategy. Meijer and Jensen (2017) have examined the issue of global dynamic density and increasing complexity of international interactions leading to problems in the development of coherent Grand Strategy. This examination of the impact of Obama's Grand Strategy and the pivot on the cyber diplomacy between the US and China demonstrates how the more assertive stance taken towards China in Obama's second term fits into the broader strategy of the United States at that time.\n\nIt also shows there was alignment between the Grand Strategy, actions in cyber diplomacy and traditional diplomacy. The focus on the economic impacts and policies, and the threat China posed to the US's economic power and its corporations in cyberspace, aligns with the pivot's focus on demonstrating US economic strength to the Asia-Pacific region. The pivot was also aimed at establishing deeper alliances and partnerships in the region. This aim can also be clearly seen in the US's responses to China in its cyber diplomacy. The pivot redistributed US resources -- military, political and economic -- to focus more intently on reimposing its influence and reiterating its leadership of the Asia-Pacific region. This also provided the opportunity for the US to take a more assertive line against China in relation to its cyber activities, as the sharper tools in the diplomatic toolbox could be backed by sufficient resource to make them credible. The result is the evident change in approach that the US took to China in the first and second Obama administrations. Much can be learned from this development and implementation of Grand Strategy, incorporating cyber diplomacy, for future policymakers.\n\nPolicy-makers need to understand cyber diplomacy and its place in the context of broader diplomacy and international relations. When formulating Grand Strategy, government officials need to utilise that understanding to include cyber diplomacy as part of Grand Strategy. In the cyber age it no longer suffices to ignore this element of international relations or to formulate cyber strategies in isolation. President Obama's legacy is to demonstrate the impact of cyber diplomacy on national security and how to align it within a Grand Strategy.\n\nI would like to acknowledge the fruitful discussions about this article and its contents engaged in with Professor Greg Austin. His wisdom was invaluable.",

    "abstract": "President Obama was a cyber president. He understood the importance of cybersecurity and its implications for national security. Cyber issues were a major focus of Sino-US relations during his time in office. There was, however, a notable shift in the approach that the US took in its engagement in cyber diplomacy with China between Obama's first (2009-2012) and second terms (2013-2016). It is important to understand why this shift occurred. Examining Sino-US cyber diplomacy in isolation will not provide the answers. There is a need to understand the broader context of Sino-US relations and what was occurring in more traditional diplomacy to get a more complete picture of the situation, particularly the impact of the pivot that occurred in late 2011. Despite the complexities of modern international relations and the difficulties of integrating cyber strategy and policy with broader Grand Strategy, it is important to examine how this was done. Analysing the example of Sino-US relations during Obama's time in office demonstrates some important lessons for how cyber diplomacy cannot be isolated from the broader diplomatic context of a relationship, but needs to be analysed in the context of its integration into broader Grand Strategy.",
