INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.”² He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”³\n\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy.⁴ States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults.⁵ The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.”⁶ NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”⁷\n\nAs states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.⁸\n\nFor over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur.⁹ Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons.¹⁰ Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers.¹¹ As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare.¹² However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions.¹³ While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict,¹⁴ the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not”¹⁵ and that “Russia retains the right\n\n⁸ Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁹ Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS\n\nTo develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n\n## A. Cyberspace\n\nWhile there is no internationally accepted definition of \"cyberspace,\" numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines \"cyberspace\" as \"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"¹⁷ Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition. \"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 125",

I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”²⁰\n\n## B. Cyber Warfare\n\nAs with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.”²¹ The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”²² Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.”²³ This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt,\n\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64",

DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\nThis section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n\n## A.

Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.”²⁹ However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon.³⁰ This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.”³¹ In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.”³² This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.³³\n\nAlso in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.”³⁴ This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.”³⁵ One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces\n\n²⁸ Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Doctrine\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security.³⁷ This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.”³⁸ It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”³⁹\n\nJoint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations.⁴⁰ This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.”⁴¹ It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure.⁴² This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three\n\n³⁶ *Id.* at 49.\n\n³⁷ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n\n³⁸ *Id.* at 2.\n\n³⁹ *Id.*\n\n⁴⁰ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n\n⁴¹ *Id.* at II-4\n\n⁴² *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 129",

This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies.⁶³ In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.”⁶⁴ According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others.⁶⁵ A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks.⁶⁶ A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers.⁶⁷ In 2005, the PLA began to\n\n---\n\n⁶¹ Brook, supra note 57.\n⁶² Id.\n⁶³ Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁶⁴ Alexander, supra note 53.\n⁶⁵ Coleman, supra note 63.\n⁶⁶ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia\n\nRussia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine,⁶⁹ with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention.⁷⁰ Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force.⁷¹ Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.⁷²\n\n## 3. Development in North Korea\n\nIn 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception.⁷³ North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb⁷⁴—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.⁷⁵\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 133",

WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\n\nIn the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state.⁷⁶ It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place.⁷⁷ This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack\n\nA DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁷⁸ It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service.⁷⁹ One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.⁸⁰\n\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system.⁸¹ DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations.⁸² In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W.

Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.⁸⁴\n\n## B. Malicious Programs\n\nMalicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer.⁸⁵ An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers.⁸⁶ The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software.⁸⁷ Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable.⁸⁸ Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.⁸⁹\n\nA virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another.⁹⁰ The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself.⁹¹ In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload.⁹² Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data\n\n⁸³ Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98\n\nA Trojan horse is \"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103\n\nA blended threat is \"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet\n\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64",

Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\n\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information.¹³⁹ According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities.¹⁴⁰ In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks.¹⁴¹ Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is . . . They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.”¹⁴² Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”¹⁴³\n\nTitan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003.¹⁴⁴ The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain.¹⁴⁵ The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military.¹⁴⁶ The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation\n\n¹³⁷ Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n¹³⁸ Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE\n\nThe maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations.¹⁴⁸ The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter.¹⁴⁹ Article 2(3) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members states “shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.”¹⁵⁰ Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹⁵¹ Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states:\n\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . .¹⁵²\n\nIn *Nicaragua v. United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law.¹⁵³ However, exactly what kinds of action constitute a use of force or armed attack is debatable, as the U.N. Charter does not define either phrase.\n\nA good place to look at what may constitute a use of force or an armed attack is the General Assembly’s resolution defining\n\n¹⁴⁷ Tom Espiner, *Security experts Lift Lid on Chinese hack attacks*, ZDNET.COM, Nov. 23, 2005, http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-145763.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n\n¹⁴⁸ SEAN D.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.”¹⁵⁵ Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\n\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union.¹⁵⁶ The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.¹⁵⁷ If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law.¹⁵⁸ However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n\n¹⁵⁴ Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition.¹⁷⁹ The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services.¹⁸⁰ However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism.¹⁸¹ The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either.¹⁸² Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state.¹⁸³ This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”¹⁸⁴\n\nWhat level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force.

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down.¹⁸⁵ The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke.¹⁸⁶ While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States.¹⁸⁷ Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities.¹⁸⁸ Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet.¹⁸⁹ These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands.¹⁹⁰ This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\n\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51,¹⁹¹ and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\n\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C.

This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\n\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case.¹⁹³ This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it.¹⁹⁴ In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law”¹⁹⁵ and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.”¹⁹⁶ Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR\n\nCyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare.¹⁹⁷ Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n\n### A.

Military Necessity\n\nThe principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible.¹⁹⁸ U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863.¹⁹⁹ Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect\n\n¹⁹⁷ Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n\n¹⁹⁸ See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n\n¹⁹⁹ Jefferson D.

Distinction\n\nAccording to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁰² Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”²⁰³ and also “the civilian population . . . as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.”²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁰⁵\n\n## 3. Proportionality\n\nThe principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective.²⁰⁶ Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage\n\n²⁰⁰ Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum.

The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\n\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”²⁰⁷ shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,”²⁰⁸ (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,”²⁰⁹ and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.”²¹⁰ Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.²¹¹\n\n## 4. Unnecessary Suffering\n\nHague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.”²¹² Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.”²¹³ This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n\n## 5. Perfidy\n\nTreacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other.²¹⁴ Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.²¹⁵\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 151",

It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.²¹⁸\n\nBecause cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy.

For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another.²²⁷ Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.²²⁸\n\n## B. Targeting\n\nMilitary objectives are legitimate targets.

Targeting People\n\nPeople can be divided into two categories: combatants and non-combatants. Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains.²³⁶ These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities.²³⁷ Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.”²³⁸ Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.”²³⁹ Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.²⁴⁰\n\n²³⁰ Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n\n²³¹ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n\n²³² Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n\n²³³ Id.\n\n²³⁴ Id.\n\n²³⁵ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n\n²³⁶ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n\n²³⁷ Id.\n\n²³⁸ Id. art. 43(1).\n\n²³⁹ Id. art. 44(3).\n\n²⁴⁰ Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III].

A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities.²⁴¹ The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.²⁴² Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited.²⁴³ Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁴⁴ The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n\n## 2. Targeting Places\n\nHague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended.²⁴⁵ Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack . . .”²⁴⁶ Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.”²⁴⁷ Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁴⁸ This\n\nwear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.*\n\n²⁴¹ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n²⁴² *Id.* art. 51(2).\n²⁴³ *Id.*\n²⁴⁴ *Id.* art. 51(3).\n²⁴⁵ Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n²⁴⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n²⁴⁷ *Id.* art. 52(3).\n²⁴⁸ *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 155",

Dual-Use Targets\n\nDual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers.²⁵³ Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.²⁵⁴\n\nAs previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker.²⁵⁵ The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military\n\ndirect support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n\n²⁴⁹ Id.\n\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 56(1).\n\n²⁵¹ See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows:\n\nDual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257\n\nThe international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n\n256 Id. art. 51(5)(b).\n\n257 Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, International Humanitarian Law Issues In A Potential War In Iraq (2003), available at http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/iraq0202003.htm#5.\n\n258 Eritrea Ethiopia Claims Commission, Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims, Eritrea’s Claims 1, 3, 5, 9-13, 14, 21, 25 &amp; 26 33 (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.pca-cpa.org/upload/files/FINAL%20ER%20FRONT%20CLAIMS.pdf.\n\n259 Id. at 35.\n\n260 Id.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 157",

Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters.²⁶¹ However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system.²⁶² Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.”²⁶³ This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\n\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared\n\n²⁶¹ Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n²⁶² Id.\n²⁶³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n\n158 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64",

While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\n\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\n\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks.²⁶⁴ Deleting military files, or even the\n\n²⁶⁴ A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together.

These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\n\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted, \"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"²⁶⁵\n\n## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\n\nThe law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility.²⁶⁶ This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law.²⁶⁷ The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act.²⁶⁸ Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations.

Outer Space Treaty\n\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space.²⁷⁷ While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military.²⁷⁸ However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful.²⁷⁹ The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere.²⁸⁰ Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.²⁸¹\n\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .”²⁸² The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state.²⁸³ Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.²⁸⁴\n\n²⁷⁷ UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n\n²⁷⁸ See Major Robert A.

For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes.²⁸⁵ Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military.²⁸⁶ As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.²⁸⁷ On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military.²⁸⁸ A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.²⁸⁹\n\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n\n## 2. Liability Convention\n\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.²⁹⁰ In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n\n²⁸⁵ *Id.* at 148-149.\n\n²⁸⁶ Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F.

For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.²⁹⁴\n\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.²⁹⁵\n\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\n\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)²⁹⁶ and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC)²⁹⁷ as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations.

It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country.³⁰⁰ Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency³⁰¹ and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.³⁰²\n\nArticle 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.”³⁰³ This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used . . .”³⁰⁴ Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services.³⁰⁵ An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals.³⁰⁶ This prohibition does not\n\n²⁹⁸ Id. art. 35\n²⁹⁹ Id. annex 2.\n³⁰⁰ Id. art. 37.\n³⁰¹ Id. art. 19(2).\n³⁰² Id. art. 20.\n³⁰³ Id. art. 38(1).\n³⁰⁴ Id. art. 38(2).\n³⁰⁵ Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n³⁰⁶ See LAWRENCE T.

Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency.

Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation\n\nThe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation³²³ supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death”³²⁴ or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.”³²⁵ This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n\n## D. Arms Control Treaties\n\nArms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification.³²⁶ For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in\n\n³²³ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n\n³²⁴ Id. art.

For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other . . . to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” $^{343}$ This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 171",

However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\n\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports.³⁴⁴ Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.³⁴⁵\n\nDespite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\n\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology.³⁴⁶ The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry.³⁴⁷ In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons.³⁴⁸ In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place\n\n³⁴⁴ See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n³⁴⁵ Id. at 1032.\n³⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n³⁴⁷ Id.\n³⁴⁸ Id.",

INTRODUCTION\nIn 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.”² He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”³\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy.⁴ States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults.⁵ The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.”⁶ NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”⁷\nAs states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.⁸\nFor over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur.⁹ Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons.¹⁰ Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers.¹¹ As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare.¹² However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions.¹³ While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict,¹⁴ the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not”¹⁵ and that “Russia retains the right\n⁸ Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁹ Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS\nTo develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n## A. Cyberspace\nWhile there is no internationally accepted definition of \"cyberspace,\" numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines \"cyberspace\" as \"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"¹⁷ Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition. \"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the\nCyber Warfare Operations 125\nWorld Wide Web.”¹⁸ A 2001 Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress defined “cyberspace” as the “total interconnectedness of human beings through computers and telecommunication without regard to physical geography.”¹⁹\nThese multiple definitions of “cyberspace” illustrate the difficulty in defining the term, which may be one of the difficulties in creating any type of common agreement among states as to how international law should be applied to warfare conducted in cyberspace. I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”²⁰\n## B. Cyber Warfare\nAs with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.”²¹ The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”²² Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.”²³ This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt,\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nor usurp information resident in or transiting through networks.”²⁴ A 2001 CRS Report for Congress, notes that “[c]yberwarfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”²⁵ A 2006 CRS Report for Congress defined the phrase “computer network attack” as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks.”²⁶ Kevin Coleman, a Senior Fellow and Strategic Management Consultant at the Technolytics Institute, an independent executive think tank, defined “cyber war” as “a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.”²⁷\nThese various definitions again illustrate the difficulty in defining what is meant by “cyber warfare.” Recognizing that military operations in cyberspace could be viewed as warfare, I propose the phrase “cyber warfare operations” be used in analyzing the wide range of military operations in cyberspace and suggest the following definition: “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state.”\n## III. DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nThis section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n## A. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in the United States\nThe current state of planning for cyber warfare operations has been likened to the early years following the invention of the atomic\nCyber Warfare Operations 127\nbomb a half-century ago, when thinking about how to wage nuclear war lagged behind the ability to launch one.²⁸ Richard A. Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.”²⁹ However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon.³⁰ This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.”³¹ In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.”³² This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.³³\nAlso in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.”³⁴ This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.”³⁵ One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces\n²⁸ Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Doctrine\nDepartment of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security.³⁷ This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.”³⁸ It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”³⁹\nJoint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations.⁴⁰ This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.”⁴¹ It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure.⁴² This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three\n³⁶ *Id.* at 49.\n³⁷ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n³⁸ *Id.* at 2.\n³⁹ *Id.*\n⁴⁰ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n⁴¹ *Id.* at II-4\n⁴² *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\nCyber Warfare Operations 129\ncategories: computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.⁴³\nFinally, Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 provides guidance for planning and conducting Air Force information operations to support the warfighter and achieve national strategy objectives.⁴⁴ This Directive states that Air Force information operations consist of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations, network warfare operations, and influence operations.⁴⁵ It also notes that network operations are comprised of network attack, network defense, and network warfare support.⁴⁶\n## 2. Organization\nThe U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is one of 10 unified commands under the Department of Defense. Part of USSTRATCOM’s mission is to ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and to deliver integrated kinetic and non-kinetic effects, including information operations, in support of Joint Force Commander operations.⁴⁷ USSTRATCOM helps plan and coordinate offensive computer operations across military and defense agencies through what it calls the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).⁴⁸\nJFCC-NW plans and, when directed, executes operations in and through cyberspace, assuring U.S. and allied forces freedom of action, denying adversaries’ freedom of action, and enabling effects beyond the cyber domain.⁴⁹ One of the key roles for the JFCC-NW is to foster new lines of communication for network warfare-related activities, bringing together the various organizations within the military that work in this area.⁵⁰ Additional key tasks for JFCC-NW are to develop standard procedures and doctrine for network warfare activities⁵¹ and ensure that U.S. forces have the tools they need to wage network warfare today and in the future.⁵²\n130 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nIn March 2005, the National Defense Strategy identified cyberspace as a new theater of operations.⁵³ Also in 2005, the Air Force mission statement expanded to reflect that cyberspace was now an official Air Force domain: “to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.”⁵⁴ In 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace.⁵⁵ Also in 2006, the Air Force stood up the 67th Network Warfare Wing.⁵⁶ “The Air Force established the 67th Network Warfare Wing to have an organization solely focused on ensuring that our networks are able to operate in time of peace and war and to have the capability to deal with potential adversaries who may be trying to exploit our networks.”⁵⁷ The 67th Network Warfare Wing provides full spectrum network operations from the offensive capabilities of assessment, exploitation, and attack to operating and defending Air Force networks.⁵⁸ In 2007, demonstrating another step in the Air Force's move to develop an organizational structure for fighting in cyberspace, the Air Force announced it would be officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command.⁵⁹ This plan, however, was altered slightly in 2008 when the Air Force announced that, instead of creating a new major command, it would be standing up a component numbered air force that would focus on cyberspace warfighting operations.⁶⁰\n⁵³ Kevin B.

Training\nThe Air Force has also implemented new training in the realm of cyber warfare operations. All Airmen, officer and enlisted, will be taught about cyber warfare in their initial accession training.⁶¹ In addition, approximately 100 students per year will receive more advanced instruction at the Undergraduate Network Warfare Training course, where graduates of the six-month program will be able to operate a computer like a weapon system.⁶²\n## B. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in other States\nA number of states are also incorporating cyber warfare as a new part of their military doctrine. This section will briefly examine cyber warfare operations in China, Russia, and North Korea.\n### 1. Development in China\nChina currently possesses a significant cyber weapons and intelligence infrastructure, and their cyber warfare doctrine is designed to achieve global “electronic dominance” by 2050. This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies.⁶³ In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.”⁶⁴ According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others.⁶⁵ A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks.⁶⁶ A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers.⁶⁷ In 2005, the PLA began to\n---\n⁶¹ Brook, supra note 57.\n⁶² Id.\n⁶³ Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁶⁴ Alexander, supra note 53.\n⁶⁵ Coleman, supra note 63.\n⁶⁶ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia\nRussia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine,⁶⁹ with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention.⁷⁰ Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force.⁷¹ Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.⁷²\n## 3. Development in North Korea\nIn 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception.⁷³ North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb⁷⁴—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.⁷⁵\nCyber Warfare Operations 133\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IV. WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nIn the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state.⁷⁶ It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place.⁷⁷ This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack\nA DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁷⁸ It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service.⁷⁹ One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.⁸⁰\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system.⁸¹ DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations.⁸² In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W. Williamson III wrote:\nAmerica needs a network that can project power by building an af.mil robot network (botnet) that can direct\n---\n⁷⁶ Coleman, supra note 27.\n⁷⁷ Id.\n⁷⁸ TechWeb.Com, Technocyclopedia, Denial of Service Attack, http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=denialofserviceattack (last visited Sept. 1, 2009).\n⁷⁹ CERT Coordination Center, Denial of Service Attacks, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Nono, Botnets fight back with Denial of service attacks!!, PC1NEWS.COM, Sep 12, 2008, http://www.pc1news.com/news/0221/botnets-fight-back-with-denial-of-service-attacks-.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n⁸² Kevin Coleman, Department of Cyber Defense, An organization who’s time has come!, TECHNOLOGY, Nov. 2007, at 2, available at http://www.technolytics.com/Dept_of_Cyber_Defense.pdf.\nsuch massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic. America needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack.⁸³\nA Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.⁸⁴\n## B. Malicious Programs\nMalicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer.⁸⁵ An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers.⁸⁶ The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software.⁸⁷ Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable.⁸⁸ Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.⁸⁹\nA virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another.⁹⁰ The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself.⁹¹ In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload.⁹² Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data\n⁸³ Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98\nA Trojan horse is \"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103\nA blended threat is \"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nvulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack, which means they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage.¹⁰⁵\nPolymorphic malware is “malicious software that has the ability to change its signature randomly each time it replicates.”¹⁰⁶ This technique is used to avoid detection by anti-spyware programs designed to recognize malware by its signature.¹⁰⁷ With polymorphic malware, only the appearance of the code is altered, not the function.¹⁰⁸\n## C. Logic Bomb\nA logic bomb is malicious code designed to execute if specific events occur or at a predetermined time.¹⁰⁹ Once triggered, it can take down the computer, delete data, or activate a DoS attack by generating bogus transactions.¹¹⁰\n## D. IP Spoofing\nIP spoofing, also known as IP address forgery or a host file hijack, is a hijacking technique in which hijackers masquerade as a trusted host to conceal their identity, spoof a Website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network.¹¹¹ When IP spoofing is used to hijack a browser, a visitor who types in the uniform resource locator (URL) of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent web page created by the hijacker. If the user interacts with dynamic content on a spoofed page, the hijacker can gain access to sensitive information or computer or network resources.¹¹²\n## E. Digital Manipulation\nDigital image manipulation is the alteration of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, which often reflects new meaning. This technique involves already existing imagery, such as photographs or videos.¹¹³\nCyber Warfare Operations\n137\nDoctoring photographs has been around as long as photography itself.¹¹⁴ In the intelligence and security communities one of the purposes of photo alteration is to misinform or deceive.¹¹⁵ As digital photo manipulation software increases in technical sophistication and people become more adept at using the software, the task of detecting manipulated images has become very challenging and digital photographic manipulation is now so sophisticated that it is sometimes impossible to discern whether people or objects in a photograph were actually there when the photo was taken.¹¹⁶ In 2006, it was uncovered that the media engaged in photo manipulation during the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hizbullah group.¹¹⁷ It is quite conceivable that a state could easily engage in photo manipulation, perhaps even changing images displayed on the internet by other states.\nIt is now possible to manipulate video in real time. In the fraction of a second between video frames, any person or object moving in the foreground can be edited out, and objects that aren't there can be edited in and made to look real.¹¹⁸ This fluidity stems from the changeable nature of the pixels that make up modern video.¹¹⁹ It is now possible to insert sets of pixels into satellite imagery data that interpreters would view as battalions of tanks or war planes.¹²⁰ Princeton Video Imaging (PVI) bolstered this point in a demo tape set in a suburban parking lot. The scene appeared ordinary except for amidst the SUVs and minivans are several parked tanks and one armored behemoth rolling incongruously along.¹²¹ Deleting people or objects from live video, or inserting prerecorded people or objects into live scenes, is only the beginning. The video manipulators can make previously recorded speakers say and do things they never actually said or did. In addition, modern technology compresses what used to take an hour into a sixtieth of a second, which permits real-time manipulation as a camera records or broadcasts.¹²²\nThe combination of real-time, virtual insertion with existing and emerging post-production techniques opens up a world of manipulative\n¹¹⁴ See, e.g., HANY FARID, PHOTO TAMPERING THROUGHOUT HISTORY, http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁵ See Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security, Photo Alteration, http://www.espionageinfo.com/Pa-Po/Photo-Alteration.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ See Yaakov Lappin, Reuters Admits to More Image Manipulation, YNETNEWS.COM, Aug. 7, 2006, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287774,00.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁸ Ivan Amato, Lying With Pixels, Seeing is No Longer believing, TECH.

Additionally, states could create completely fabricated real time webcasts showing their adversaries doing whatever they deem appropriate for their purposes. James Currie, a professor of political science at the National Defense University, who also has experience as a staffer with TOP SECRET clearance on the Senate’s Intelligence Committee and as a legislative liaison for the Secretary of the Army, is convinced that the military and intelligence communities will, or already do, possess real-time video manipulation capabilities.¹²⁴ Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators considered creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or getting caught in a sexually compromising situation and then distributing the tapes in Iraq and the Arab world.¹²⁵\nVoice morphing enables the cloning of speech patterns and creation of an accurate copy of a person's voice, which can then say anything the operator wishes it to say, appearing to be the voice of someone else.¹²⁶ George Papcun of the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed this technology.¹²⁷ The Washington Post detailed how Mr. Papcun could, in near real time, clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile by using just a 10-minute digital recording.¹²⁸\n## V. CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO ESPIONAGE\nA large amount of the cyber operations performed by a military will involve the collection of data or intelligence stored on another state’s network or analyzing the configuration of the network. These types of actions, provided they do not disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, should not be considered cyber warfare operations. The international community should view such activities as a form of espionage or cyber espionage. Espionage is the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting,\n¹²³ Id.\n¹²⁴ Id.\n¹²⁵ William M.

These two incidents demonstrate how espionage in the computer age has changed. Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information.¹³⁹ According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities.¹⁴⁰ In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks.¹⁴¹ Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is . . . They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.”¹⁴² Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”¹⁴³\nTitan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003.¹⁴⁴ The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain.¹⁴⁵ The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military.¹⁴⁶ The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation\n¹³⁷ Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n¹³⁸ Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE\nThe maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations.¹⁴⁸ The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter.¹⁴⁹ Article 2(3) of the U.N.

Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹⁵¹ Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . .¹⁵²\nIn *Nicaragua v. United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law.¹⁵³ However, exactly what kinds of action constitute a use of force or armed attack is debatable, as the U.N. Charter does not define either phrase.\nA good place to look at what may constitute a use of force or an armed attack is the General Assembly’s resolution defining\n¹⁴⁷ Tom Espiner, *Security experts Lift Lid on Chinese hack attacks*, ZDNET.COM, Nov. 23, 2005, http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-145763.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹⁴⁸ SEAN D.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.”¹⁵⁵ Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union.¹⁵⁶ The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.¹⁵⁷ If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law.¹⁵⁸ However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n¹⁵⁴ Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 143\nIn April 2007, important websites in Estonia, including the website of the president, parliament, ministries, political parties, major news outlets, and Estonia’s two dominant banks, were hit by a series of DoS attacks.¹⁵⁹ These attacks continued until mid-June.¹⁶⁰ A Defense Ministry spokesman said sites that usually received 1,000 visits a day were buried under as many as 2,000 a second.¹⁶¹ Officials in Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks and security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian servers, including domains registered to the government and to the administration of then President Putin.¹⁶² The Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia’s complaints as fabrications.¹⁶³ Estonia reported the attacks to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).¹⁶⁴\nThe NATO Treaty, which Estonia and most EU Member States are a party to, provides that an attack on one of its members shall be considered an attack against all and enables party nations to exercise the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.¹⁶⁵ Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo called the attacks a national security situation and compared the situation to the shutdown of sea ports.¹⁶⁶ This comparison is interesting as Article 3(c) of the General Assembly’s resolution defining aggression lists “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State” as an act of aggression.¹⁶⁷ However, it should be noted that Article 41 of the U.N. Charter cites “complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”¹⁶⁸ After discussing the situation with NATO officials, Mr. Aaviksoo stated, “at present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition.¹⁷⁹ The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services.¹⁸⁰ However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism.¹⁸¹ The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either.¹⁸² Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state.¹⁸³ This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”¹⁸⁴\nWhat level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force. But what about the interfering with, or disruption of, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, and nuclear power plant safety systems?

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down.¹⁸⁵ The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke.¹⁸⁶ While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States.¹⁸⁷ Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities.¹⁸⁸ Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet.¹⁸⁹ These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands.¹⁹⁰ This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51,¹⁹¹ and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, has argued that an action can be defined as an armed attack if that action is intended to cause injury, death,\n¹⁸⁵ Ted Bridis &amp; Eileen Sullivan, *US Video Shows Hacker Hit on Power Grid*, SFGATE.COM (SAN.

This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case.¹⁹³ This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it.¹⁹⁴ In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law”¹⁹⁵ and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.”¹⁹⁶ Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR\nCyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare.¹⁹⁷ Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n### A. General Principles of the Law of War\n#### 1. Military Necessity\nThe principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible.¹⁹⁸ U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863.¹⁹⁹ Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect\n¹⁹⁷ Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n¹⁹⁸ See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n¹⁹⁹ Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1, 6 (2005).\nCyber Warfare Operations 149\ncustomary international law.²⁰⁰ It states that a military attack is lawful only against “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”²⁰¹\n## 2. Distinction\nAccording to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁰² Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”²⁰³ and also “the civilian population . . . as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.”²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁰⁵\n## 3. Proportionality\nThe principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective.²⁰⁶ Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage\n²⁰⁰ Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum. Law, Cambridge, Jan. 27-29, 2003), available at http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/pdfs/Session1.pdf.\n²⁰¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 52(2), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n²⁰² Sassòli, supra note 200, at 1. Additional Protocol I, Article 48, states this basic rule as, “the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Additional Protocol I, art. 48.\n²⁰³ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 13(1), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609, [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II, art. 13(2).\n²⁰⁵ Id. art. 13(3).\n²⁰⁶ Rod Powers, Law of Armed Conflict, ABOUT.COM: US MILITARY, at 2, http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n150 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\ngained. The law of war requires one to weigh the expected collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by the operation. The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”²⁰⁷ shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,”²⁰⁸ (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,”²⁰⁹ and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.”²¹⁰ Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.²¹¹\n## 4. Unnecessary Suffering\nHague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.”²¹² Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.”²¹³ This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n## 5. Perfidy\nTreacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other.²¹⁴ Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.²¹⁵\nCyber Warfare Operations 151\nPerfidy involves injuring the enemy by using his adherence to the law of war against him. Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1), also states, “it is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy”²¹⁶ and “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.”²¹⁷ Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare*, provides:\nThe line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct, but the following examples indicate the correct principles. It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.²¹⁸\nBecause cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy. Such misinformation is synonymous with any other method for delivering misinformation.²¹⁹\n## 6. Neutrality\nNeutrality is an essential tenet of international law.²²⁰ Neutrality affords states the right to maintain relations with all belligerents.²²¹ States that declare themselves neutral, and behave\n²¹⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 37(1).\n²¹⁷ *Id.* The following examples are provided: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status, and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.\n²¹⁸ FM 27-10, *supra* note 198, ¶ 50.\n²¹⁹ See Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n²²⁰ *Korns* &amp; *Kastenberg*, *supra* note 12, at 73.\n²²¹ *Id.* at 62.\n152 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\naccordingly, are entitled to immunity from attack.²²² Under the principle of neutrality a neutral state’s territory is to be secure from assault or trespass.²²³ Also, belligerents are forbidden from moving troops, munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral state.²²⁴ However, should the neutral state fail for any reason to prevent violations of its neutrality by the troops of one belligerent entering or passing through its territory, the other belligerent may be justified in attacking the enemy forces on this territory.²²⁵ Authors in the cyber law arena have suggested that in order to remain neutral in a cyber conflict a state cannot originate a cyber attack, and it also has to take action to prevent a cyber attack from transiting its internet nodes.²²⁶\nNeutrality becomes problematic for cyber warfare operations because the weapons of cyber warfare, such as requests being sent by computer systems from which DoS attacks originate or the malicious code that travels along networks, cannot always be predicted. For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another.²²⁷ Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.²²⁸\n## B. Targeting\nMilitary objectives are legitimate targets. Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage.”²²⁹ Objects which, by their nature, make an effective contribution to military action would include objects directly used by the armed force, such as: weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots, buildings occupied by armed forces, staff\n²²² Id.\n²²³ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 26 Stat. 2310, U.S.T. 540 (which states “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable”) [hereinafter Hague Convention V].\n²²⁴ Id. art. 2.\n²²⁵ FM 27-10 supra note 198, ¶ 520.\n²²⁶ Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 12, at 62; Jeffrey T.G.

Targeting People\nPeople can be divided into two categories: combatants and non-combatants. Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains.²³⁶ These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities.²³⁷ Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.”²³⁸ Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.”²³⁹ Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.²⁴⁰\n²³⁰ Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n²³¹ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n²³² Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n²³³ Id.\n²³⁴ Id.\n²³⁵ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n²³⁶ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n²³⁷ Id.\n²³⁸ Id. art. 43(1).\n²³⁹ Id. art. 44(3).\n²⁴⁰ Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III]. These requirements include “being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;”\n154 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nUnlike combatants, the law of war prohibits direct attacks on non-combatants. Non-combatants may be divided into two groups: civilians and enemy personnel out of combat. A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities.²⁴¹ The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.²⁴² Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited.²⁴³ Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁴⁴ The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n## 2. Targeting Places\nHague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended.²⁴⁵ Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack . . .”²⁴⁶ Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.”²⁴⁷ Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁴⁸ This\nwear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.*\n²⁴¹ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n²⁴² *Id.* art. 51(2).\n²⁴³ *Id.*\n²⁴⁴ *Id.* art. 51(3).\n²⁴⁵ Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n²⁴⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n²⁴⁷ *Id.* art. 52(3).\n²⁴⁸ *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and\nCyber Warfare Operations 155\nprotection terminates, however, if the enemy is using them in specific ways to support its war effort.²⁴⁹\nMoreover, “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁵⁰ It needs to be noted that the U.S. has not ratified Additional Protocol I and specifically objects, for military reasons, to Article 56.²⁵¹ The objection is that this Article disregards the longstanding principle of proportionality and prohibits the attack if there are to be “severe” civilian losses, no matter how important the target may be from a military point of view.²⁵²\n## 3. Dual-Use Targets\nDual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers.²⁵³ Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.²⁵⁴\nAs previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker.²⁵⁵ The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military\ndirect support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n²⁴⁹ Id.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 56(1).\n²⁵¹ See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows:\nDual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257\nThe international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n256 Id. art. 51(5)(b).\n257 Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, International Humanitarian Law Issues In A Potential War In Iraq (2003), available at http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/iraq0202003.htm#5.\n258 Eritrea Ethiopia Claims Commission, Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims, Eritrea’s Claims 1, 3, 5, 9-13, 14, 21, 25 &amp; 26 33 (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.pca-cpa.org/upload/files/FINAL%20ER%20FRONT%20CLAIMS.pdf.\n259 Id. at 35.\n260 Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 157\nC. Analysis\nCyber warfare operations have the capability of being a very effective option during an armed conflict. Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters.²⁶¹ However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system.²⁶² Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.”²⁶³ This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared\n²⁶¹ Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n²⁶² Id.\n²⁶³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n158 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nto a conventional attack intended to accomplish the same results, and would therefore be lawful.\nA more difficult example to analyze is the altering of electronic maintenance manuals of an adversary’s aircraft stored on a network. While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks.²⁶⁴ Deleting military files, or even the\n²⁶⁴ A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. See Webopedia.com, network, http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/n/network.html (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\nCyber Warfare Operations 159\nannihilation of military computer networks, would constitute a proper military objective. These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted, \"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"²⁶⁵\n## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nThe law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility.²⁶⁶ This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law.²⁶⁷ The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act.²⁶⁸ Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations. This section will examine a few areas states should consider when developing plans for cyber warfare operations.\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nA. International Outer Space Law\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was created by the U.N. in 1959.²⁶⁹ The purpose of COPUOS is to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise U.N. programs in this field, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space.²⁷⁰ COPUOS is the only international forum for the development of international space law. Since its inception, the Committee concluded five international legal instruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities.²⁷¹ The five international treaties are: the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty),²⁷² the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement),²⁷³ the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention),²⁷⁴ the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention),²⁷⁵ and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Moon Treaty).²⁷⁶ The Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention both include language that may impact cyber warfare operations.\n²⁶⁹ G.A.

Outer Space Treaty\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space.²⁷⁷ While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military.²⁷⁸ However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful.²⁷⁹ The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere.²⁸⁰ Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.²⁸¹\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .”²⁸² The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state.²⁸³ Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.²⁸⁴\n²⁷⁷ UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n²⁷⁸ See Major Robert A. Ramey, *Armed Conflict on the Final Frontier: The Law of War in Space*, 48 A.F. L. REV. 1, 79 (2000).\n²⁷⁹ Id.\n²⁸⁰ Id.\n²⁸¹ Id.\n²⁸² Id. at 77; Outer Space Treaty, supra note 272, art. IX.\n²⁸³ Id.\n²⁸⁴ Id.\nSpace assets also create dual-use issues, specifically regarding commercial assets. For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes.²⁸⁵ Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military.²⁸⁶ As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.²⁸⁷ On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military.²⁸⁸ A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.²⁸⁹\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n## 2. Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.²⁹⁰ In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n²⁸⁵ *Id.* at 148-149.\n²⁸⁶ Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F. L. REV. 157, 200 (2004) (citing Katie McConnell, *Military Satellite Communications: The March Toward Commercialization*, DEFENSE DAILY (2003)).\n²⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 51(5)(b).\n²⁸⁸ *Ramey*, *supra* note 278, at 150.\n²⁸⁹ *Id.*\n²⁹⁰ *Liability Convention*, *supra* note 274, art. II.\nCyber Warfare Operations 163\nis the state’s fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.²⁹¹ The Convention provides exoneration from absolute liability to the extent that a launching state establishes the damage resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant state.²⁹² However, no exoneration will be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching state which are not in conformity with international law.²⁹³\nTherefore, a state conducting cyber warfare operations against another state’s satellite may be liable to the launching state for the damage done to the satellite and by the satellite, as a result of operations against it. For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.²⁹⁴\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.²⁹⁵\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)²⁹⁶ and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC)²⁹⁷ as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations. For example, Article 35 of the ITC prohibits harmful interference with the radio spectrum.\nAll stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognized\n²⁹¹ *Id.* art.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency responsible for promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunication.\n²⁹⁷ International Telecommunications Convention, Nairobi, Nov. 6, 1982, 32 U.S.T. 3821 [hereinafter ITU Convention].\n164 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nprivate operating agencies, or of other duly authorized operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.²⁹⁸\nHarmful interference is defined as “interference which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations.”²⁹⁹\nArticle 37 of the ITC may also impact cyber warfare operations. It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country.³⁰⁰ Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency³⁰¹ and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.³⁰²\nArticle 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.”³⁰³ This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used . . .”³⁰⁴ Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services.³⁰⁵ An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals.³⁰⁶ This prohibition does not\n²⁹⁸ Id. art. 35\n²⁹⁹ Id. annex 2.\n³⁰⁰ Id. art. 37.\n³⁰¹ Id. art. 19(2).\n³⁰² Id. art. 20.\n³⁰³ Id. art. 38(1).\n³⁰⁴ Id. art. 38(2).\n³⁰⁵ Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n³⁰⁶ See LAWRENCE T.

Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency. As a result, while a state may, under certain circumstances, block or suspend international communications, it may not lawfully spoof communications. However, there is ample precedent that provisions of international communication conventions are suspended between belligerents engaged in armed conflicts.³⁰⁸\n## C. International Aviation Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of, or interference with, civilian aviation may implicate numerous international aviation laws. Such operations may involve disrupting an air traffic control tower, modifying a flight’s passenger list, or adding a name to a no-fly list. These types of operations have the potential to result in a delay or cancellation of flights, thereby interrupting travel plans of targeted belligerents.\n## 1. The Convention on International Civil Aviation\nThe primary international law governing aviation is the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention.³⁰⁹ This Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft\n³⁰⁷ *Id.*\n³⁰⁸ See Dep’t of Defense General Counsel, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* 33 (May 1999), available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf.\n³⁰⁹ Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, Dec. 7, 1944, 15 U.N.T.S. 295, [hereinafter Chicago Convention].\n166 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nregistration, and safety.³¹⁰ The Convention is supported by eighteen annexes containing standards and recommended practices; these annexes are amended regularly by ICAO.³¹¹ Annex 17 sets out the basis for the ICAO civil aviation security program and seeks to safeguard civil aviation and its facilities against acts of unlawful interference.³¹² This Annex requires that each member state “have as its primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public in all matters related to safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation.”³¹³\nA 1998 amendment to the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircraft.³¹⁴ Article 3 bis(a) specifically states that “the contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight . . .”³¹⁵ Article 89 of the Chicago Convention allows a contracting state to disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency.\n[I]n case of war, the provisions of this Convention shall not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States affected, whether as belligerents or as neutrals. The same principle shall apply in the case of any contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies the fact to the Council.³¹⁶\nCyber warfare operations targeting civilian aviation may run afoul of a state’s obligation under the Chicago Convention to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Additionally, if a cyber warfare operation targets an aircraft in flight, the operation very well may be a violation of the Article 3bis requirement to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

This national emergency exception may provide some latitude in conducting cyber warfare operations in situations short of war.\n## 2. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation\nThe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention of 1971, makes specific conduct unlawful.³¹⁷ Article 1 provides that a person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally does or attempts to do any of the following:\n[1] performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft;³¹⁸ [2] destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;³¹⁹ [3] places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;³²⁰ [4] destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight;³²¹ or, [5] communicates information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.³²²\nThis Convention may limit the ability to conduct cyber warfare operations that interfere with an aircraft’s operating system, if such an operation would render the aircraft incapable of flight. Additionally, this Convention may also place a prohibition on interfering with the networks of air navigation facilities, as it essentially prohibits the ability to disrupt air traffic control communications or other aspects of air\n³¹⁷ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 564 [hereinafter Montreal Convention].\n³¹⁸ Id. art. 1(1)(a).\n³¹⁹ Id. art. 1(1)(b).\n³²⁰ Id. art. 1(1)(c).\n³²¹ Id. art. 1(1)(d).\n³²² Id. art. 1(1)(e).\n168 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nnavigation, if it interferes with their operation and endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight. Finally, this Convention may prohibit cyber warfare operations from spoofing communication if it would endanger the safety of an aircraft. However, nothing in this Convention appears to limit cyber warfare operations that do not render a flight unable to fly or endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight.\n## 3. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation\nThe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation³²³ supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death”³²⁴ or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.”³²⁵ This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n## D. Arms Control Treaties\nArms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification.³²⁶ For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in\n³²³ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n³²⁴ Id. art. II, para 1..\n³²⁵ Id.\n³²⁶ Wingfield, supra note 18, at 330.\nCyber Warfare Operations 169\naccordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\"³²⁷ This agreement also provided that “each Party undertakes not to use deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the provisions of this Interim Agreement.”³²⁸ This became standard language in arms control treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union as evidenced by the language in Article XV of the 1979 Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and Protocol Thereto (SALT II), which states that “paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are adopted verbatim from the first two paragraphs of Article XII of the ABM Treaty and Article V of the Interim Agreement.”³²⁹ The third paragraph of this Article prohibits deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the Treaty.³³⁰\nArms control treaties that place a prohibition on interfering with the national technical means of a state may limit the ability of both states to conduct cyber warfare operations against the intelligence collecting capabilities of the other. However, arms control treaties, like other treaties except those defining laws of war, are suspended during war between parties.³³¹ Therefore, cyber warfare operations that interfere with military reconnaissance satellites used for arms control verification may violate the treaty. However, during hostilities these satellites would become a proper military objective.\n## E. Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime\nThe Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks.³³² The main objective of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation.³³³ The U.S. ratified the Cybercrime\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nConvention in 2006. $^{334}$ This Convention covers a broad range of criminal conduct broken up into four categories: offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems; $^{335}$ computer-related offenses; $^{336}$ content-related offenses; $^{337}$ and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. $^{338}$\nCyber Warfare Operations would most likely run afoul of the offenses described within the first category, in particular Articles 2 through 5, which relate to illegal access, illegal interception, data interference, and system interference, respectively. $^{339}$ However, its rules do not apply to government activities, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. $^{340}$ For example, Article 2 requires states to adopt “legislative and other measures” to establish as criminal offenses under their domestic law intentional “access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right.” $^{341}$ The accompanying Explanatory Report clarifies that the “without right” caveat “leaves unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority,” including acts to “protect national security or investigate criminal offences.” $^{342}$ Nevertheless, this Convention still poses potential problems for conducting cyber warfare operations. For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other . . . to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” $^{343}$ This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\nCyber Warfare Operations 171\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IX. CONCLUSION\nNothing in international law explicitly prohibits cyber warfare operations. However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports.³⁴⁴ Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.³⁴⁵\nDespite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology.³⁴⁶ The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry.³⁴⁷ In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons.³⁴⁸ In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place\n³⁴⁴ See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n³⁴⁵ Id. at 1032.\n³⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n³⁴⁷ Id.\n³⁴⁸ Id.\non the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers . . . .\"349 I contend that the future Mr. Kuryanovich discusses is now, and that now is the time for states to determine what is and is not permitted under international law in relation to cyber warfare operations. Failure to do so now may result in overly restrictive, reactionary regulations in response to a cyber Pearl Harbor-like attack, rather than a well thought out, proactive, structured approach.\nCyber Warfare Operations 173\n349 Brian Krebs, Lithuania Weathers Cyber Attack, Braces for Round 2, WASH.

INTRODUCTION\nIn 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.” He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy. States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults. The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.” NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”\nAs states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield. One commentator noted:\nThe rapid advancement of cyber attacks and the emergence of cyber warfare have caught government\nCyber Warfare Operations 123\n Randall Mikkelsen, U.S. Not Ready for Cyber Attack, REUTERS, Dec. 19, 2008, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4BI00520081219 (quoting Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security).\n John A.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.\nFor over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur. Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons. Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers. As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare. However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions. While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict, the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not” and that “Russia retains the right\n Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS\nTo develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n## A. Cyberspace\nWhile there is no internationally accepted definition of \"cyberspace,\" numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines \"cyberspace\" as \"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\" Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition. \"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the\nCyber Warfare Operations 125\nWorld Wide Web.” A 2001 Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress defined “cyberspace” as the “total interconnectedness of human beings through computers and telecommunication without regard to physical geography.”\nThese multiple definitions of “cyberspace” illustrate the difficulty in defining the term, which may be one of the difficulties in creating any type of common agreement among states as to how international law should be applied to warfare conducted in cyberspace. I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”\n## B. Cyber Warfare\nAs with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.” The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.” Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.” This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt,\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nor usurp information resident in or transiting through networks.” A 2001 CRS Report for Congress, notes that “[c]yberwarfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.” A 2006 CRS Report for Congress defined the phrase “computer network attack” as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks.” Kevin Coleman, a Senior Fellow and Strategic Management Consultant at the Technolytics Institute, an independent executive think tank, defined “cyber war” as “a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.”\nThese various definitions again illustrate the difficulty in defining what is meant by “cyber warfare.” Recognizing that military operations in cyberspace could be viewed as warfare, I propose the phrase “cyber warfare operations” be used in analyzing the wide range of military operations in cyberspace and suggest the following definition: “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state.”\n## III. DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nThis section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n## A. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in the United States\nThe current state of planning for cyber warfare operations has been likened to the early years following the invention of the atomic\nCyber Warfare Operations 127\nbomb a half-century ago, when thinking about how to wage nuclear war lagged behind the ability to launch one. Richard A. Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.” However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon. This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.” In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.” This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.\nAlso in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.” This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.” One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces\n Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Since 2003, there has been a gradual development of incorporating cyber warfare into military doctrine and in creating an organizational structure for managing cyber warfare operations, highlighted most recently by the establishment of the 24th Air Force, a new numbered air force focused on the cyber mission.\n## 1. Doctrine\nDepartment of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security. This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.” It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”\nJoint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations. This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.” It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure. This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three\n *Id.* at 49.\n U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n *Id.* at 2.\n *Id.*\n JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n *Id.* at II-4\n *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\nCyber Warfare Operations 129\ncategories: computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.\nFinally, Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 provides guidance for planning and conducting Air Force information operations to support the warfighter and achieve national strategy objectives. This Directive states that Air Force information operations consist of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations, network warfare operations, and influence operations. It also notes that network operations are comprised of network attack, network defense, and network warfare support.\n## 2. Organization\nThe U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is one of 10 unified commands under the Department of Defense. Part of USSTRATCOM’s mission is to ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and to deliver integrated kinetic and non-kinetic effects, including information operations, in support of Joint Force Commander operations. USSTRATCOM helps plan and coordinate offensive computer operations across military and defense agencies through what it calls the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).\nJFCC-NW plans and, when directed, executes operations in and through cyberspace, assuring U.S. and allied forces freedom of action, denying adversaries’ freedom of action, and enabling effects beyond the cyber domain. One of the key roles for the JFCC-NW is to foster new lines of communication for network warfare-related activities, bringing together the various organizations within the military that work in this area. Additional key tasks for JFCC-NW are to develop standard procedures and doctrine for network warfare activities and ensure that U.S. forces have the tools they need to wage network warfare today and in the future.\n\nIn March 2005, the National Defense Strategy identified cyberspace as a new theater of operations. Also in 2005, the Air Force mission statement expanded to reflect that cyberspace was now an official Air Force domain: “to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.” In 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace. Also in 2006, the Air Force stood up the 67th Network Warfare Wing. “The Air Force established the 67th Network Warfare Wing to have an organization solely focused on ensuring that our networks are able to operate in time of peace and war and to have the capability to deal with potential adversaries who may be trying to exploit our networks.” The 67th Network Warfare Wing provides full spectrum network operations from the offensive capabilities of assessment, exploitation, and attack to operating and defending Air Force networks. In 2007, demonstrating another step in the Air Force's move to develop an organizational structure for fighting in cyberspace, the Air Force announced it would be officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command. This plan, however, was altered slightly in 2008 when the Air Force announced that, instead of creating a new major command, it would be standing up a component numbered air force that would focus on cyberspace warfighting operations.\n Kevin B.

Training\nThe Air Force has also implemented new training in the realm of cyber warfare operations. All Airmen, officer and enlisted, will be taught about cyber warfare in their initial accession training. In addition, approximately 100 students per year will receive more advanced instruction at the Undergraduate Network Warfare Training course, where graduates of the six-month program will be able to operate a computer like a weapon system.\n## B. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in other States\nA number of states are also incorporating cyber warfare as a new part of their military doctrine. This section will briefly examine cyber warfare operations in China, Russia, and North Korea.\n### 1. Development in China\nChina currently possesses a significant cyber weapons and intelligence infrastructure, and their cyber warfare doctrine is designed to achieve global “electronic dominance” by 2050. This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies. In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.” According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others. A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks. A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers. In 2005, the PLA began to\n---\n Brook, supra note 57.\n Id.\n Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n Alexander, supra note 53.\n Coleman, supra note 63.\n U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia\nRussia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine, with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention. Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force. Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.\n## 3. Development in North Korea\nIn 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception. North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.\nCyber Warfare Operations 133\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IV. WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nIn the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state. It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place. This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack\nA DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.” It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system. DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations. In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W. Williamson III wrote:\nAmerica needs a network that can project power by building an af.mil robot network (botnet) that can direct\n---\n Coleman, supra note 27.\n Id.\n TechWeb.Com, Technocyclopedia, Denial of Service Attack, http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=denialofserviceattack (last visited Sept. 1, 2009).\n CERT Coordination Center, Denial of Service Attacks, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n Id.\n Nono, Botnets fight back with Denial of service attacks!!, PC1NEWS.COM, Sep 12, 2008, http://www.pc1news.com/news/0221/botnets-fight-back-with-denial-of-service-attacks-.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n Kevin Coleman, Department of Cyber Defense, An organization who’s time has come!, TECHNOLOGY, Nov. 2007, at 2, available at http://www.technolytics.com/Dept_of_Cyber_Defense.pdf.\nsuch massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic. America needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack.\nA Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.\n## B. Malicious Programs\nMalicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer. An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers. The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software. Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable. Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.\nA virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another. The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself. In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload. Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data\n Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98\nA Trojan horse is \"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103\nA blended threat is \"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nvulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack, which means they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage.\nPolymorphic malware is “malicious software that has the ability to change its signature randomly each time it replicates.” This technique is used to avoid detection by anti-spyware programs designed to recognize malware by its signature. With polymorphic malware, only the appearance of the code is altered, not the function.\n## C. Logic Bomb\nA logic bomb is malicious code designed to execute if specific events occur or at a predetermined time. Once triggered, it can take down the computer, delete data, or activate a DoS attack by generating bogus transactions.\n## D. IP Spoofing\nIP spoofing, also known as IP address forgery or a host file hijack, is a hijacking technique in which hijackers masquerade as a trusted host to conceal their identity, spoof a Website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network. When IP spoofing is used to hijack a browser, a visitor who types in the uniform resource locator (URL) of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent web page created by the hijacker. If the user interacts with dynamic content on a spoofed page, the hijacker can gain access to sensitive information or computer or network resources.\n## E. Digital Manipulation\nDigital image manipulation is the alteration of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, which often reflects new meaning. This technique involves already existing imagery, such as photographs or videos.\nCyber Warfare Operations\n\nIt is now possible to manipulate video in real time. In the fraction of a second between video frames, any person or object moving in the foreground can be edited out, and objects that aren't there can be edited in and made to look real. This fluidity stems from the changeable nature of the pixels that make up modern video. It is now possible to insert sets of pixels into satellite imagery data that interpreters would view as battalions of tanks or war planes. Princeton Video Imaging (PVI) bolstered this point in a demo tape set in a suburban parking lot. The scene appeared ordinary except for amidst the SUVs and minivans are several parked tanks and one armored behemoth rolling incongruously along. Deleting people or objects from live video, or inserting prerecorded people or objects into live scenes, is only the beginning. The video manipulators can make previously recorded speakers say and do things they never actually said or did. In addition, modern technology compresses what used to take an hour into a sixtieth of a second, which permits real-time manipulation as a camera records or broadcasts.\nThe combination of real-time, virtual insertion with existing and emerging post-production techniques opens up a world of manipulative\n See, e.g., HANY FARID, PHOTO TAMPERING THROUGHOUT HISTORY, http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n See Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security, Photo Alteration, http://www.espionageinfo.com/Pa-Po/Photo-Alteration.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Id.\n See Yaakov Lappin, Reuters Admits to More Image Manipulation, YNETNEWS.COM, Aug. 7, 2006, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287774,00.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Ivan Amato, Lying With Pixels, Seeing is No Longer believing, TECH.

For example, one could insert a world leader into a live broadcast of CNN and have the individual say whatever one wishes. Additionally, states could create completely fabricated real time webcasts showing their adversaries doing whatever they deem appropriate for their purposes. James Currie, a professor of political science at the National Defense University, who also has experience as a staffer with TOP SECRET clearance on the Senate’s Intelligence Committee and as a legislative liaison for the Secretary of the Army, is convinced that the military and intelligence communities will, or already do, possess real-time video manipulation capabilities. Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators considered creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or getting caught in a sexually compromising situation and then distributing the tapes in Iraq and the Arab world.\nVoice morphing enables the cloning of speech patterns and creation of an accurate copy of a person's voice, which can then say anything the operator wishes it to say, appearing to be the voice of someone else. George Papcun of the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed this technology. The Washington Post detailed how Mr. Papcun could, in near real time, clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile by using just a 10-minute digital recording.\n## V. CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO ESPIONAGE\nA large amount of the cyber operations performed by a military will involve the collection of data or intelligence stored on another state’s network or analyzing the configuration of the network. These types of actions, provided they do not disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, should not be considered cyber warfare operations. The international community should view such activities as a form of espionage or cyber espionage. Espionage is the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting,\n Id.\n Id.\n William M.

The Department of Defense uses the term “computer network exploitation” to describe “enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.” Another term that fits under this category of cyber espionage is what the Air Force calls “network warfare support,” which is defined as “actions tasked by or under direct control of an operational commander to search for, intercept, identify, and locate or localize sources of access and vulnerability for the purpose of immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations.” Network warfare support “provides information required for immediate decisions involving network warfare operations” and “can be used to produce intelligence, or provide targeting for electronic or destructive attack.”\nArticle 24 of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention IV recognizes the lawfulness of espionage during armed conflict, specifically providing that “ruses of war and the employment of measures necessary for obtaining information about the enemy and the country are considered permissible.” No international convention has ever addressed the legality of peacetime espionage and espionage has been practiced by states for centuries. Additionally, international law does not prohibit espionage as a fundamentally wrongful activity.\nThomas Wingfield, a Research Fellow at the Potomac Institute, concluded that the right to conduct espionage is an essential part of a state’s inherent right of self-defense and stated, “the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations recognizes the well-established right of nations to engage in espionage during peacetime and the practice of states has specifically recognized a right to engage in such clandestine intelligence collection activities as an inherent part of foreign relations and policy.” Individual states have, however, enacted laws that severely punish espionage against their own\n See Joint Pub. 1-02, supra note 17, at 190.\n Id. at 113.\n AFPD 10-7, supra note 23, at 20.\n Id.\n Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and its annex: Regulation Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, art. 24, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, 1 Bevans 631 [hereinafter Hague Convention IV].\n Roger D.

In general, espionage is treated as lawful under public international law and unlawful under domestic law.\nTwo examples of activities viewed as cyber espionage are the Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain incidents. These two incidents demonstrate how espionage in the computer age has changed. Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information. According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities. In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks. Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is . . . They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.” Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”\nTitan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003. The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain. The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military. The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation\n Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE\nThe maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations. The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter. Article 2(3) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members states “shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.” Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . .\nIn *Nicaragua v. United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law. However, exactly what kinds of action constitute a use of force or armed attack is debatable, as the U.N. Charter does not define either phrase.\nA good place to look at what may constitute a use of force or an armed attack is the General Assembly’s resolution defining\n Tom Espiner, *Security experts Lift Lid on Chinese hack attacks*, ZDNET.COM, Nov. 23, 2005, http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-145763.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n SEAN D.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.” Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law. However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 143\nIn April 2007, important websites in Estonia, including the website of the president, parliament, ministries, political parties, major news outlets, and Estonia’s two dominant banks, were hit by a series of DoS attacks. These attacks continued until mid-June. A Defense Ministry spokesman said sites that usually received 1,000 visits a day were buried under as many as 2,000 a second. Officials in Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks and security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian servers, including domains registered to the government and to the administration of then President Putin. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia’s complaints as fabrications. Estonia reported the attacks to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe NATO Treaty, which Estonia and most EU Member States are a party to, provides that an attack on one of its members shall be considered an attack against all and enables party nations to exercise the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo called the attacks a national security situation and compared the situation to the shutdown of sea ports. This comparison is interesting as Article 3(c) of the General Assembly’s resolution defining aggression lists “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State” as an act of aggression. However, it should be noted that Article 41 of the U.N. Charter cites “complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.” After discussing the situation with NATO officials, Mr. Aaviksoo stated, “at present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action.

Some in NATO now believe the attacks were Russia testing the West's preparedness for cyber-warfare in general and of NATO's commitment to its newest, weakest members in particular.\nThe debate as to whether this type of cyber warfare operation could be considered a use of force was re-energized in August 2008, following accusations that Russia was behind attacks on Georgian government sites shortly before the launching of Russian military action. On August 7, 2008, following separatist provocations, Georgian forces launched a surprise attack against the separatist forces. On August 8, Russia responded to Georgia’s act with military operations into Georgian territory, which the Georgian authorities viewed as military aggression against Georgia. The evening of August 7, before the Russian invasion into Georgia commenced, cyber attacks were already being launched against a large number of Georgian governmental websites, making it among the first cases in which a coordinated cyber offensive accompanied, or even preceded, an international political and military conflict. As with the Estonian incident, there is no conclusive proof of who was behind the attacks. However, the level of advance preparation and reconnaissance strongly suggested that officials within the Russian government or military primed Russian hackers for the assault. Scott Borg, director of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a think tank that advises governments and companies, stated at the time, “we are in a world where governments have not decided yet whether the tools of cyberattacks are\n Ryan, supra note 159.\n Cyber War as the Ultimate Weapon, STRATEGYWORLD.COM, Jan. 5, 2008, http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htiw/articles/20080105.aspx (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Anne Applebaum, For Estonia and NATO, A New Kind of War, WASH.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition. The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services. However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either. Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state. This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”\nWhat level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force. But what about the interfering with, or disruption of, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, and nuclear power plant safety systems? This is likely one of the next scenarios regarding the issue of\n Siobhan Gorman, Cyberattacks on Georgian Web Sites Are Reigniting a Washington Debate, WALL ST.

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down. The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke. While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States. Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities. Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet. These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands. This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51, and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, has argued that an action can be defined as an armed attack if that action is intended to cause injury, death,\n Ted Bridis &amp; Eileen Sullivan, *US Video Shows Hacker Hit on Power Grid*, SFGATE.COM (SAN.

While there is currently nothing affirming that a cyber attack equates to an unlawful use of force or armed attacked under international law, using Schmitt’s analysis a cyber attack that has the potential to cause, or actually causes, physical damage, injury, or death would constitute a use of force or an armed attack. This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case. This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it. In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law” and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.” Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR\nCyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare. Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n### A. General Principles of the Law of War\n#### 1. Military Necessity\nThe principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible. U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863. Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect\n Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1, 6 (2005).\nCyber Warfare Operations 149\ncustomary international law. It states that a military attack is lawful only against “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”\n## 2. Distinction\nAccording to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations” and also “the civilian population . . . as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.” Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n## 3. Proportionality\nThe principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective. Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage\n Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum. Law, Cambridge, Jan. 27-29, 2003), available at http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/pdfs/Session1.pdf.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 52(2), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n Sassòli, supra note 200, at 1. Additional Protocol I, Article 48, states this basic rule as, “the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Additional Protocol I, art. 48.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 13(1), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609, [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n Additional Protocol II, art. 13(2).\n Id. art. 13(3).\n Rod Powers, Law of Armed Conflict, ABOUT.COM: US MILITARY, at 2, http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n\ngained. The law of war requires one to weigh the expected collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by the operation. The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,” (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,” and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.” Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.\n## 4. Unnecessary Suffering\nHague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.” Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.” This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n## 5. Perfidy\nTreacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other. Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.\nCyber Warfare Operations 151\nPerfidy involves injuring the enemy by using his adherence to the law of war against him. Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1), also states, “it is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy” and “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.” Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare*, provides:\nThe line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct, but the following examples indicate the correct principles. It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.\nBecause cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy. Such misinformation is synonymous with any other method for delivering misinformation.\n## 6. Neutrality\nNeutrality is an essential tenet of international law. Neutrality affords states the right to maintain relations with all belligerents. States that declare themselves neutral, and behave\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 37(1).\n *Id.* The following examples are provided: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status, and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.\n FM 27-10, *supra* note 198, ¶ 50.\n See Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n *Korns* &amp; *Kastenberg*, *supra* note 12, at 73.\n *Id.* at 62.\n\naccordingly, are entitled to immunity from attack. Under the principle of neutrality a neutral state’s territory is to be secure from assault or trespass. Also, belligerents are forbidden from moving troops, munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral state. However, should the neutral state fail for any reason to prevent violations of its neutrality by the troops of one belligerent entering or passing through its territory, the other belligerent may be justified in attacking the enemy forces on this territory. Authors in the cyber law arena have suggested that in order to remain neutral in a cyber conflict a state cannot originate a cyber attack, and it also has to take action to prevent a cyber attack from transiting its internet nodes.\nNeutrality becomes problematic for cyber warfare operations because the weapons of cyber warfare, such as requests being sent by computer systems from which DoS attacks originate or the malicious code that travels along networks, cannot always be predicted. For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another. Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.\n## B. Targeting\nMilitary objectives are legitimate targets. Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage.” Objects which, by their nature, make an effective contribution to military action would include objects directly used by the armed force, such as: weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots, buildings occupied by armed forces, staff\n Id.\n Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 26 Stat. 2310, U.S.T. 540 (which states “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable”) [hereinafter Hague Convention V].\n Id. art. 2.\n FM 27-10 supra note 198, ¶ 520.\n Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 12, at 62; Jeffrey T.G.

Location refers to objects that by their nature have no military function but by virtue of their location make an effective contribution to military action, such as a bridge. Purpose is concerned with the intended future use of an object, while use is concerned with its present function. Most civilian objects can become useful objects to the armed forces; for example, a school or a hotel is a civilian object, but if used to accommodate troops or headquarters staff, it becomes a military objective. If there is a doubt concerning the purpose, such place must be presumed to serve civilian purposes.\nNext, review the phrase “definite military advantage.” This phrase makes it illegitimate to launch an attack which only offers potential or indeterminate advantages. Now that we have defined the phrase “military objectives,” the next step is to examine specific types of targets, specifically, people, places, and dual-use targets.\n1. Targeting People\nPeople can be divided into two categories: combatants and non-combatants. Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains. These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities. Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.” Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.” Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.\n Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n Id.\n Id. art. 43(1).\n Id. art. 44(3).\n Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III]. These requirements include “being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;”\n\nUnlike combatants, the law of war prohibits direct attacks on non-combatants. Non-combatants may be divided into two groups: civilians and enemy personnel out of combat. A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities. The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n## 2. Targeting Places\nHague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended. Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack . . .” Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.” Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” This\nwear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.*\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n *Id.* art. 51(2).\n *Id.*\n *Id.* art. 51(3).\n Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n *Id.* art. 52(3).\n *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and\nCyber Warfare Operations 155\nprotection terminates, however, if the enemy is using them in specific ways to support its war effort.\nMoreover, “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” It needs to be noted that the U.S. has not ratified Additional Protocol I and specifically objects, for military reasons, to Article 56. The objection is that this Article disregards the longstanding principle of proportionality and prohibits the attack if there are to be “severe” civilian losses, no matter how important the target may be from a military point of view.\n## 3. Dual-Use Targets\nDual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers. Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.\nAs previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker. The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military\ndirect support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n Id.\n Id. art. 56(1).\n See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows:\nDual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257\nThe international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 157\nC. Analysis\nCyber warfare operations have the capability of being a very effective option during an armed conflict. Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters. However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system. Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.” This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared\n Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n Id.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n\nto a conventional attack intended to accomplish the same results, and would therefore be lawful.\nA more difficult example to analyze is the altering of electronic maintenance manuals of an adversary’s aircraft stored on a network. While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks. Deleting military files, or even the\n A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. See Webopedia.com, network, http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/n/network.html (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\nCyber Warfare Operations 159\nannihilation of military computer networks, would constitute a proper military objective. These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted, \"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"\n## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nThe law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility. This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law. The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations. This section will examine a few areas states should consider when developing plans for cyber warfare operations.\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nA. International Outer Space Law\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was created by the U.N. in 1959. The purpose of COPUOS is to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise U.N. programs in this field, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space. COPUOS is the only international forum for the development of international space law. Since its inception, the Committee concluded five international legal instruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities. The five international treaties are: the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty), the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention), the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention), and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Moon Treaty). The Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention both include language that may impact cyber warfare operations.\n G.A.

Res. 34/68, annex, Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (July 11, 1984).\nCyber Warfare Operations 161\n\n# 1. Outer Space Treaty\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space. While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military. However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful. The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere. Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .” The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state. Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.\n UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n See Major Robert A. Ramey, *Armed Conflict on the Final Frontier: The Law of War in Space*, 48 A.F. L. REV. 1, 79 (2000).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 77; Outer Space Treaty, supra note 272, art. IX.\n Id.\n Id.\nSpace assets also create dual-use issues, specifically regarding commercial assets. For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes. Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military. As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military. A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n## 2. Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n *Id.* at 148-149.\n Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F. L. REV. 157, 200 (2004) (citing Katie McConnell, *Military Satellite Communications: The March Toward Commercialization*, DEFENSE DAILY (2003)).\n See Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 51(5)(b).\n *Ramey*, *supra* note 278, at 150.\n *Id.*\n *Liability Convention*, *supra* note 274, art. II.\nCyber Warfare Operations 163\nis the state’s fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible. The Convention provides exoneration from absolute liability to the extent that a launching state establishes the damage resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant state. However, no exoneration will be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching state which are not in conformity with international law.\nTherefore, a state conducting cyber warfare operations against another state’s satellite may be liable to the launching state for the damage done to the satellite and by the satellite, as a result of operations against it. For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC) as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations. For example, Article 35 of the ITC prohibits harmful interference with the radio spectrum.\nAll stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognized\n *Id.* art. III.\n *Id.* art. VI(1).\n *Id.* art. VI(2).\n See, e.g., Wingfield, *supra* note 18, at 327-328.\n See, e.g., *id.*\n See International Telecommunication Union, About ITU, http://www.itu.int/net/about/index.aspx (last visited Sept. 14, 2009). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency responsible for promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunication.\n International Telecommunications Convention, Nairobi, Nov. 6, 1982, 32 U.S.T. 3821 [hereinafter ITU Convention].\n\nprivate operating agencies, or of other duly authorized operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.\nHarmful interference is defined as “interference which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations.”\nArticle 37 of the ITC may also impact cyber warfare operations. It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country. Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.\nArticle 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.” This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used . . .” Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services. An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals. This prohibition does not\n Id. art. 35\n Id. annex 2.\n Id. art. 37.\n Id. art. 19(2).\n Id. art. 20.\n Id. art. 38(1).\n Id. art. 38(2).\n Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n See LAWRENCE T.

Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency. As a result, while a state may, under certain circumstances, block or suspend international communications, it may not lawfully spoof communications. However, there is ample precedent that provisions of international communication conventions are suspended between belligerents engaged in armed conflicts.\n## C. International Aviation Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of, or interference with, civilian aviation may implicate numerous international aviation laws. Such operations may involve disrupting an air traffic control tower, modifying a flight’s passenger list, or adding a name to a no-fly list. These types of operations have the potential to result in a delay or cancellation of flights, thereby interrupting travel plans of targeted belligerents.\n## 1. The Convention on International Civil Aviation\nThe primary international law governing aviation is the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention. This Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft\n *Id.*\n See Dep’t of Defense General Counsel, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* 33 (May 1999), available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf.\n Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, Dec. 7, 1944, 15 U.N.T.S. 295, [hereinafter Chicago Convention].\n\nregistration, and safety. The Convention is supported by eighteen annexes containing standards and recommended practices; these annexes are amended regularly by ICAO. Annex 17 sets out the basis for the ICAO civil aviation security program and seeks to safeguard civil aviation and its facilities against acts of unlawful interference. This Annex requires that each member state “have as its primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public in all matters related to safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation.”\nA 1998 amendment to the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircraft. Article 3 bis(a) specifically states that “the contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight . . .” Article 89 of the Chicago Convention allows a contracting state to disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency.\n[I]n case of war, the provisions of this Convention shall not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States affected, whether as belligerents or as neutrals. The same principle shall apply in the case of any contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies the fact to the Council.\nCyber warfare operations targeting civilian aviation may run afoul of a state’s obligation under the Chicago Convention to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Additionally, if a cyber warfare operation targets an aircraft in flight, the operation very well may be a violation of the Article 3bis requirement to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation\nThe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention of 1971, makes specific conduct unlawful. Article 1 provides that a person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally does or attempts to do any of the following:\n[1] performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft; [2] destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight; [3] places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to endanger its safety in flight; [4] destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight; or, [5] communicates information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.\nThis Convention may limit the ability to conduct cyber warfare operations that interfere with an aircraft’s operating system, if such an operation would render the aircraft incapable of flight. Additionally, this Convention may also place a prohibition on interfering with the networks of air navigation facilities, as it essentially prohibits the ability to disrupt air traffic control communications or other aspects of air\n Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 564 [hereinafter Montreal Convention].\n Id. art. 1(1)(a).\n Id. art. 1(1)(b).\n Id. art. 1(1)(c).\n Id. art. 1(1)(d).\n Id. art. 1(1)(e).\n\nnavigation, if it interferes with their operation and endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight. Finally, this Convention may prohibit cyber warfare operations from spoofing communication if it would endanger the safety of an aircraft. However, nothing in this Convention appears to limit cyber warfare operations that do not render a flight unable to fly or endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight.\n## 3. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation\nThe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death” or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.” This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n## D. Arms Control Treaties\nArms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification. For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in\n Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n Id. art. II, para 1..\n Id.\n Wingfield, supra note 18, at 330.\nCyber Warfare Operations 169\naccordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\" This agreement also provided that “each Party undertakes not to use deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the provisions of this Interim Agreement.” This became standard language in arms control treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union as evidenced by the language in Article XV of the 1979 Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and Protocol Thereto (SALT II), which states that “paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are adopted verbatim from the first two paragraphs of Article XII of the ABM Treaty and Article V of the Interim Agreement.” The third paragraph of this Article prohibits deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the Treaty.\nArms control treaties that place a prohibition on interfering with the national technical means of a state may limit the ability of both states to conduct cyber warfare operations against the intelligence collecting capabilities of the other. However, arms control treaties, like other treaties except those defining laws of war, are suspended during war between parties. Therefore, cyber warfare operations that interfere with military reconnaissance satellites used for arms control verification may violate the treaty. However, during hostilities these satellites would become a proper military objective.\n## E. Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime\nThe Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks. The main objective of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation. The U.S. ratified the Cybercrime\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nConvention in 2006. $^{334}$ This Convention covers a broad range of criminal conduct broken up into four categories: offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems; $^{335}$ computer-related offenses; $^{336}$ content-related offenses; $^{337}$ and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. $^{338}$\nCyber Warfare Operations would most likely run afoul of the offenses described within the first category, in particular Articles 2 through 5, which relate to illegal access, illegal interception, data interference, and system interference, respectively. $^{339}$ However, its rules do not apply to government activities, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. $^{340}$ For example, Article 2 requires states to adopt “legislative and other measures” to establish as criminal offenses under their domestic law intentional “access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right.” $^{341}$ The accompanying Explanatory Report clarifies that the “without right” caveat “leaves unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority,” including acts to “protect national security or investigate criminal offences.” $^{342}$ Nevertheless, this Convention still poses potential problems for conducting cyber warfare operations. For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other . . . to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” $^{343}$ This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\nCyber Warfare Operations 171\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IX. CONCLUSION\nNothing in international law explicitly prohibits cyber warfare operations. However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports. Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.\nDespite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology. The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry. In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons. In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place\n See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n Id. at 1032.\n Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n Id.\n Id.\non the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers . . . .\"349 I contend that the future Mr. Kuryanovich discusses is now, and that now is the time for states to determine what is and is not permitted under international law in relation to cyber warfare operations. Failure to do so now may result in overly restrictive, reactionary regulations in response to a cyber Pearl Harbor-like attack, rather than a well thought out, proactive, structured approach.\nCyber Warfare Operations 173",

INTRODUCTION\nIn 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.” He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy. States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults. The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.” NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”\nAs states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield. One commentator noted:\nThe rapid advancement of cyber attacks and the emergence of cyber warfare have caught government\nCyber Warfare Operations 123\n Randall Mikkelsen, U.S. Not Ready for Cyber Attack, REUTERS, Dec. 19, 2008, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4BI00520081219 (quoting Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security).\n John A.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.\nFor over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur. Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons. Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers. As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare. However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions. While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict, the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not” and that “Russia retains the right\n Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS\nTo develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n## A. Cyberspace\nWhile there is no internationally accepted definition of \"cyberspace,\" numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines \"cyberspace\" as \"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\" Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition. \"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the\nCyber Warfare Operations 125\nWorld Wide Web.” A 2001 Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress defined “cyberspace” as the “total interconnectedness of human beings through computers and telecommunication without regard to physical geography.”\nThese multiple definitions of “cyberspace” illustrate the difficulty in defining the term, which may be one of the difficulties in creating any type of common agreement among states as to how international law should be applied to warfare conducted in cyberspace. I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”\n## B. Cyber Warfare\nAs with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.” The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.” Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.” This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt,\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nor usurp information resident in or transiting through networks.” A 2001 CRS Report for Congress, notes that “[c]yberwarfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.” A 2006 CRS Report for Congress defined the phrase “computer network attack” as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks.” Kevin Coleman, a Senior Fellow and Strategic Management Consultant at the Technolytics Institute, an independent executive think tank, defined “cyber war” as “a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.”\nThese various definitions again illustrate the difficulty in defining what is meant by “cyber warfare.” Recognizing that military operations in cyberspace could be viewed as warfare, I propose the phrase “cyber warfare operations” be used in analyzing the wide range of military operations in cyberspace and suggest the following definition: “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state.”\n## III. DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nThis section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n## A. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in the United States\nThe current state of planning for cyber warfare operations has been likened to the early years following the invention of the atomic\nCyber Warfare Operations 127\nbomb a half-century ago, when thinking about how to wage nuclear war lagged behind the ability to launch one. Richard A. Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.” However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon. This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.” In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.” This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.\nAlso in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.” This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.” One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces\n Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Since 2003, there has been a gradual development of incorporating cyber warfare into military doctrine and in creating an organizational structure for managing cyber warfare operations, highlighted most recently by the establishment of the 24th Air Force, a new numbered air force focused on the cyber mission.\n## 1. Doctrine\nDepartment of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security. This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.” It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”\nJoint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations. This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.” It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure. This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three\n *Id.* at 49.\n U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n *Id.* at 2.\n *Id.*\n JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n *Id.* at II-4\n *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\nCyber Warfare Operations 129\ncategories: computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.\nFinally, Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 provides guidance for planning and conducting Air Force information operations to support the warfighter and achieve national strategy objectives. This Directive states that Air Force information operations consist of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations, network warfare operations, and influence operations. It also notes that network operations are comprised of network attack, network defense, and network warfare support.\n## 2. Organization\nThe U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is one of 10 unified commands under the Department of Defense. Part of USSTRATCOM’s mission is to ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and to deliver integrated kinetic and non-kinetic effects, including information operations, in support of Joint Force Commander operations. USSTRATCOM helps plan and coordinate offensive computer operations across military and defense agencies through what it calls the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).\nJFCC-NW plans and, when directed, executes operations in and through cyberspace, assuring U.S. and allied forces freedom of action, denying adversaries’ freedom of action, and enabling effects beyond the cyber domain. One of the key roles for the JFCC-NW is to foster new lines of communication for network warfare-related activities, bringing together the various organizations within the military that work in this area. Additional key tasks for JFCC-NW are to develop standard procedures and doctrine for network warfare activities and ensure that U.S. forces have the tools they need to wage network warfare today and in the future.\n\nIn March 2005, the National Defense Strategy identified cyberspace as a new theater of operations. Also in 2005, the Air Force mission statement expanded to reflect that cyberspace was now an official Air Force domain: “to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.” In 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace. Also in 2006, the Air Force stood up the 67th Network Warfare Wing. “The Air Force established the 67th Network Warfare Wing to have an organization solely focused on ensuring that our networks are able to operate in time of peace and war and to have the capability to deal with potential adversaries who may be trying to exploit our networks.” The 67th Network Warfare Wing provides full spectrum network operations from the offensive capabilities of assessment, exploitation, and attack to operating and defending Air Force networks. In 2007, demonstrating another step in the Air Force's move to develop an organizational structure for fighting in cyberspace, the Air Force announced it would be officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command. This plan, however, was altered slightly in 2008 when the Air Force announced that, instead of creating a new major command, it would be standing up a component numbered air force that would focus on cyberspace warfighting operations.\n Kevin B.

Training\nThe Air Force has also implemented new training in the realm of cyber warfare operations. All Airmen, officer and enlisted, will be taught about cyber warfare in their initial accession training. In addition, approximately 100 students per year will receive more advanced instruction at the Undergraduate Network Warfare Training course, where graduates of the six-month program will be able to operate a computer like a weapon system.\n## B. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in other States\nA number of states are also incorporating cyber warfare as a new part of their military doctrine. This section will briefly examine cyber warfare operations in China, Russia, and North Korea.\n### 1. Development in China\nChina currently possesses a significant cyber weapons and intelligence infrastructure, and their cyber warfare doctrine is designed to achieve global “electronic dominance” by 2050. This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies. In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.” According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others. A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks. A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers. In 2005, the PLA began to\n---\n Brook, supra note 57.\n Id.\n Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n Alexander, supra note 53.\n Coleman, supra note 63.\n U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia\nRussia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine, with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention. Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force. Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.\n## 3. Development in North Korea\nIn 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception. North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.\nCyber Warfare Operations 133\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IV. WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nIn the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state. It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place. This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack\nA DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.” It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system. DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations. In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W. Williamson III wrote:\nAmerica needs a network that can project power by building an af.mil robot network (botnet) that can direct\n---\n Coleman, supra note 27.\n Id.\n TechWeb.Com, Technocyclopedia, Denial of Service Attack, http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=denialofserviceattack (last visited Sept. 1, 2009).\n CERT Coordination Center, Denial of Service Attacks, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n Id.\n Nono, Botnets fight back with Denial of service attacks!!, PC1NEWS.COM, Sep 12, 2008, http://www.pc1news.com/news/0221/botnets-fight-back-with-denial-of-service-attacks-.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n Kevin Coleman, Department of Cyber Defense, An organization who’s time has come!, TECHNOLOGY, Nov. 2007, at 2, available at http://www.technolytics.com/Dept_of_Cyber_Defense.pdf.\nsuch massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic. America needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack.\nA Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.\n## B. Malicious Programs\nMalicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer. An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers. The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software. Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable. Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.\nA virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another. The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself. In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload. Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data\n Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98\nA Trojan horse is \"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103\nA blended threat is \"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nvulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack, which means they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage.\nPolymorphic malware is “malicious software that has the ability to change its signature randomly each time it replicates.” This technique is used to avoid detection by anti-spyware programs designed to recognize malware by its signature. With polymorphic malware, only the appearance of the code is altered, not the function.\n## C. Logic Bomb\nA logic bomb is malicious code designed to execute if specific events occur or at a predetermined time. Once triggered, it can take down the computer, delete data, or activate a DoS attack by generating bogus transactions.\n## D. IP Spoofing\nIP spoofing, also known as IP address forgery or a host file hijack, is a hijacking technique in which hijackers masquerade as a trusted host to conceal their identity, spoof a Website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network. When IP spoofing is used to hijack a browser, a visitor who types in the uniform resource locator (URL) of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent web page created by the hijacker. If the user interacts with dynamic content on a spoofed page, the hijacker can gain access to sensitive information or computer or network resources.\n## E. Digital Manipulation\nDigital image manipulation is the alteration of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, which often reflects new meaning. This technique involves already existing imagery, such as photographs or videos.\nCyber Warfare Operations\n\nIt is now possible to manipulate video in real time. In the fraction of a second between video frames, any person or object moving in the foreground can be edited out, and objects that aren't there can be edited in and made to look real. This fluidity stems from the changeable nature of the pixels that make up modern video. It is now possible to insert sets of pixels into satellite imagery data that interpreters would view as battalions of tanks or war planes. Princeton Video Imaging (PVI) bolstered this point in a demo tape set in a suburban parking lot. The scene appeared ordinary except for amidst the SUVs and minivans are several parked tanks and one armored behemoth rolling incongruously along. Deleting people or objects from live video, or inserting prerecorded people or objects into live scenes, is only the beginning. The video manipulators can make previously recorded speakers say and do things they never actually said or did. In addition, modern technology compresses what used to take an hour into a sixtieth of a second, which permits real-time manipulation as a camera records or broadcasts.\nThe combination of real-time, virtual insertion with existing and emerging post-production techniques opens up a world of manipulative\n See, e.g., HANY FARID, PHOTO TAMPERING THROUGHOUT HISTORY, http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n See Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security, Photo Alteration, http://www.espionageinfo.com/Pa-Po/Photo-Alteration.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Id.\n See Yaakov Lappin, Reuters Admits to More Image Manipulation, YNETNEWS.COM, Aug. 7, 2006, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287774,00.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Ivan Amato, Lying With Pixels, Seeing is No Longer believing, TECH.

For example, one could insert a world leader into a live broadcast of CNN and have the individual say whatever one wishes. Additionally, states could create completely fabricated real time webcasts showing their adversaries doing whatever they deem appropriate for their purposes. James Currie, a professor of political science at the National Defense University, who also has experience as a staffer with TOP SECRET clearance on the Senate’s Intelligence Committee and as a legislative liaison for the Secretary of the Army, is convinced that the military and intelligence communities will, or already do, possess real-time video manipulation capabilities. Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators considered creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or getting caught in a sexually compromising situation and then distributing the tapes in Iraq and the Arab world.\nVoice morphing enables the cloning of speech patterns and creation of an accurate copy of a person's voice, which can then say anything the operator wishes it to say, appearing to be the voice of someone else. George Papcun of the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed this technology. The Washington Post detailed how Mr. Papcun could, in near real time, clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile by using just a 10-minute digital recording.\n## V. CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO ESPIONAGE\nA large amount of the cyber operations performed by a military will involve the collection of data or intelligence stored on another state’s network or analyzing the configuration of the network. These types of actions, provided they do not disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, should not be considered cyber warfare operations. The international community should view such activities as a form of espionage or cyber espionage. Espionage is the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting,\n Id.\n Id.\n William M.

The Department of Defense uses the term “computer network exploitation” to describe “enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.” Another term that fits under this category of cyber espionage is what the Air Force calls “network warfare support,” which is defined as “actions tasked by or under direct control of an operational commander to search for, intercept, identify, and locate or localize sources of access and vulnerability for the purpose of immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations.” Network warfare support “provides information required for immediate decisions involving network warfare operations” and “can be used to produce intelligence, or provide targeting for electronic or destructive attack.”\nArticle 24 of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention IV recognizes the lawfulness of espionage during armed conflict, specifically providing that “ruses of war and the employment of measures necessary for obtaining information about the enemy and the country are considered permissible.” No international convention has ever addressed the legality of peacetime espionage and espionage has been practiced by states for centuries. Additionally, international law does not prohibit espionage as a fundamentally wrongful activity.\nThomas Wingfield, a Research Fellow at the Potomac Institute, concluded that the right to conduct espionage is an essential part of a state’s inherent right of self-defense and stated, “the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations recognizes the well-established right of nations to engage in espionage during peacetime and the practice of states has specifically recognized a right to engage in such clandestine intelligence collection activities as an inherent part of foreign relations and policy.” Individual states have, however, enacted laws that severely punish espionage against their own\n See Joint Pub. 1-02, supra note 17, at 190.\n Id. at 113.\n AFPD 10-7, supra note 23, at 20.\n Id.\n Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and its annex: Regulation Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, art. 24, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, 1 Bevans 631 [hereinafter Hague Convention IV].\n Roger D.

In general, espionage is treated as lawful under public international law and unlawful under domestic law.\nTwo examples of activities viewed as cyber espionage are the Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain incidents. These two incidents demonstrate how espionage in the computer age has changed. Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information. According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities. In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks. Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is . . . They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.” Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”\nTitan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003. The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain. The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military. The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation\n Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE\nThe maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations. The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter. Article 2(3) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members states “shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.” Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . .\nIn *Nicaragua v. United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law. However, exactly what kinds of action constitute a use of force or armed attack is debatable, as the U.N. Charter does not define either phrase.\nA good place to look at what may constitute a use of force or an armed attack is the General Assembly’s resolution defining\n Tom Espiner, *Security experts Lift Lid on Chinese hack attacks*, ZDNET.COM, Nov. 23, 2005, http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-145763.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n SEAN D.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.” Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law. However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 143\nIn April 2007, important websites in Estonia, including the website of the president, parliament, ministries, political parties, major news outlets, and Estonia’s two dominant banks, were hit by a series of DoS attacks. These attacks continued until mid-June. A Defense Ministry spokesman said sites that usually received 1,000 visits a day were buried under as many as 2,000 a second. Officials in Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks and security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian servers, including domains registered to the government and to the administration of then President Putin. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia’s complaints as fabrications. Estonia reported the attacks to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe NATO Treaty, which Estonia and most EU Member States are a party to, provides that an attack on one of its members shall be considered an attack against all and enables party nations to exercise the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo called the attacks a national security situation and compared the situation to the shutdown of sea ports. This comparison is interesting as Article 3(c) of the General Assembly’s resolution defining aggression lists “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State” as an act of aggression. However, it should be noted that Article 41 of the U.N. Charter cites “complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.” After discussing the situation with NATO officials, Mr. Aaviksoo stated, “at present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action. This means that the provisions of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, or, in other words collective self-defense, will not automatically be\n Johnny Ryan, *Growing Dangers: Emerging and Developing Security Threats*, NATO REV.

Some in NATO now believe the attacks were Russia testing the West's preparedness for cyber-warfare in general and of NATO's commitment to its newest, weakest members in particular.\nThe debate as to whether this type of cyber warfare operation could be considered a use of force was re-energized in August 2008, following accusations that Russia was behind attacks on Georgian government sites shortly before the launching of Russian military action. On August 7, 2008, following separatist provocations, Georgian forces launched a surprise attack against the separatist forces. On August 8, Russia responded to Georgia’s act with military operations into Georgian territory, which the Georgian authorities viewed as military aggression against Georgia. The evening of August 7, before the Russian invasion into Georgia commenced, cyber attacks were already being launched against a large number of Georgian governmental websites, making it among the first cases in which a coordinated cyber offensive accompanied, or even preceded, an international political and military conflict. As with the Estonian incident, there is no conclusive proof of who was behind the attacks. However, the level of advance preparation and reconnaissance strongly suggested that officials within the Russian government or military primed Russian hackers for the assault. Scott Borg, director of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a think tank that advises governments and companies, stated at the time, “we are in a world where governments have not decided yet whether the tools of cyberattacks are\n Ryan, supra note 159.\n Cyber War as the Ultimate Weapon, STRATEGYWORLD.COM, Jan. 5, 2008, http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htiw/articles/20080105.aspx (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Anne Applebaum, For Estonia and NATO, A New Kind of War, WASH.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition. The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services. However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either. Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state. This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”\nWhat level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force. But what about the interfering with, or disruption of, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, and nuclear power plant safety systems?

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down. The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke. While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States. Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities. Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet. These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands. This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51, and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, has argued that an action can be defined as an armed attack if that action is intended to cause injury, death,\n Ted Bridis &amp; Eileen Sullivan, *US Video Shows Hacker Hit on Power Grid*, SFGATE.COM (SAN.

While there is currently nothing affirming that a cyber attack equates to an unlawful use of force or armed attacked under international law, using Schmitt’s analysis a cyber attack that has the potential to cause, or actually causes, physical damage, injury, or death would constitute a use of force or an armed attack. This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case. This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it. In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law” and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.” Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR\nCyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare. Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n### A. General Principles of the Law of War\n#### 1. Military Necessity\nThe principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible. U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863. Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect\n Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1, 6 (2005).\nCyber Warfare Operations 149\ncustomary international law. It states that a military attack is lawful only against “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”\n## 2. Distinction\nAccording to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations” and also “the civilian population . . . as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.” Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n## 3. Proportionality\nThe principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective. Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage\n Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum. Law, Cambridge, Jan. 27-29, 2003), available at http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/pdfs/Session1.pdf.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 52(2), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n Sassòli, supra note 200, at 1. Additional Protocol I, Article 48, states this basic rule as, “the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Additional Protocol I, art. 48.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 13(1), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609, [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n Additional Protocol II, art. 13(2).\n Id. art. 13(3).\n Rod Powers, Law of Armed Conflict, ABOUT.COM: US MILITARY, at 2, http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n\ngained. The law of war requires one to weigh the expected collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by the operation. The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,” (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,” and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.” Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.\n## 4. Unnecessary Suffering\nHague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.” Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.” This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n## 5. Perfidy\nTreacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other. Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.\nCyber Warfare Operations 151\nPerfidy involves injuring the enemy by using his adherence to the law of war against him. Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1), also states, “it is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy” and “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.” Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare*, provides:\nThe line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct, but the following examples indicate the correct principles. It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.\nBecause cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy. Such misinformation is synonymous with any other method for delivering misinformation.\n## 6. Neutrality\nNeutrality is an essential tenet of international law. Neutrality affords states the right to maintain relations with all belligerents. States that declare themselves neutral, and behave\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 37(1).\n *Id.* The following examples are provided: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status, and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.\n FM 27-10, *supra* note 198, ¶ 50.\n See Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n *Korns* &amp; *Kastenberg*, *supra* note 12, at 73.\n *Id.* at 62.\n\naccordingly, are entitled to immunity from attack. Under the principle of neutrality a neutral state’s territory is to be secure from assault or trespass. Also, belligerents are forbidden from moving troops, munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral state. However, should the neutral state fail for any reason to prevent violations of its neutrality by the troops of one belligerent entering or passing through its territory, the other belligerent may be justified in attacking the enemy forces on this territory. Authors in the cyber law arena have suggested that in order to remain neutral in a cyber conflict a state cannot originate a cyber attack, and it also has to take action to prevent a cyber attack from transiting its internet nodes.\nNeutrality becomes problematic for cyber warfare operations because the weapons of cyber warfare, such as requests being sent by computer systems from which DoS attacks originate or the malicious code that travels along networks, cannot always be predicted. For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another. Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.\n## B. Targeting\nMilitary objectives are legitimate targets. Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage.” Objects which, by their nature, make an effective contribution to military action would include objects directly used by the armed force, such as: weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots, buildings occupied by armed forces, staff\n Id.\n Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 26 Stat. 2310, U.S.T. 540 (which states “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable”) [hereinafter Hague Convention V].\n Id. art. 2.\n FM 27-10 supra note 198, ¶ 520.\n Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 12, at 62; Jeffrey T.G.

Location refers to objects that by their nature have no military function but by virtue of their location make an effective contribution to military action, such as a bridge. Purpose is concerned with the intended future use of an object, while use is concerned with its present function. Most civilian objects can become useful objects to the armed forces; for example, a school or a hotel is a civilian object, but if used to accommodate troops or headquarters staff, it becomes a military objective. If there is a doubt concerning the purpose, such place must be presumed to serve civilian purposes.\nNext, review the phrase “definite military advantage.” This phrase makes it illegitimate to launch an attack which only offers potential or indeterminate advantages. Now that we have defined the phrase “military objectives,” the next step is to examine specific types of targets, specifically, people, places, and dual-use targets.\n1. Targeting People\nPeople can be divided into two categories: combatants and non-combatants. Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains. These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities. Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.” Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.” Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.\n Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n Id.\n Id. art. 43(1).\n Id. art. 44(3).\n Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III]. These requirements include “being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;”\n\nUnlike combatants, the law of war prohibits direct attacks on non-combatants. Non-combatants may be divided into two groups: civilians and enemy personnel out of combat. A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities. The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n## 2. Targeting Places\nHague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended. Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack . . .” Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.” Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” This\nwear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.*\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n *Id.* art. 51(2).\n *Id.*\n *Id.* art. 51(3).\n Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n *Id.* art. 52(3).\n *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and\nCyber Warfare Operations 155\nprotection terminates, however, if the enemy is using them in specific ways to support its war effort.\nMoreover, “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” It needs to be noted that the U.S. has not ratified Additional Protocol I and specifically objects, for military reasons, to Article 56. The objection is that this Article disregards the longstanding principle of proportionality and prohibits the attack if there are to be “severe” civilian losses, no matter how important the target may be from a military point of view.\n## 3. Dual-Use Targets\nDual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers. Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.\nAs previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker. The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military\ndirect support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n Id.\n Id. art. 56(1).\n See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows:\nDual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257\nThe international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 157\nC. Analysis\nCyber warfare operations have the capability of being a very effective option during an armed conflict. Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters. However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system. Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.” This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared\n Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n Id.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n\nto a conventional attack intended to accomplish the same results, and would therefore be lawful.\nA more difficult example to analyze is the altering of electronic maintenance manuals of an adversary’s aircraft stored on a network. While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks. Deleting military files, or even the\n A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. See Webopedia.com, network, http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/n/network.html (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\nCyber Warfare Operations 159\nannihilation of military computer networks, would constitute a proper military objective. These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted, \"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"\n## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nThe law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility. This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law. The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations. This section will examine a few areas states should consider when developing plans for cyber warfare operations.\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nA. International Outer Space Law\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was created by the U.N. in 1959. The purpose of COPUOS is to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise U.N. programs in this field, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space. COPUOS is the only international forum for the development of international space law. Since its inception, the Committee concluded five international legal instruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities. The five international treaties are: the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty), the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention), the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention), and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Moon Treaty). The Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention both include language that may impact cyber warfare operations.\n G.A.

Res. 34/68, annex, Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (July 11, 1984).\nCyber Warfare Operations 161\n\n# 1. Outer Space Treaty\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space. While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military. However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful. The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere. Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .” The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state. Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.\n UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n See Major Robert A. Ramey, *Armed Conflict on the Final Frontier: The Law of War in Space*, 48 A.F. L. REV. 1, 79 (2000).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 77; Outer Space Treaty, supra note 272, art. IX.\n Id.\n Id.\nSpace assets also create dual-use issues, specifically regarding commercial assets. For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes. Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military. As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military. A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n## 2. Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n *Id.* at 148-149.\n Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F. L. REV. 157, 200 (2004) (citing Katie McConnell, *Military Satellite Communications: The March Toward Commercialization*, DEFENSE DAILY (2003)).\n See Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 51(5)(b).\n *Ramey*, *supra* note 278, at 150.\n *Id.*\n *Liability Convention*, *supra* note 274, art. II.\nCyber Warfare Operations 163\nis the state’s fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible. The Convention provides exoneration from absolute liability to the extent that a launching state establishes the damage resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant state. However, no exoneration will be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching state which are not in conformity with international law.\nTherefore, a state conducting cyber warfare operations against another state’s satellite may be liable to the launching state for the damage done to the satellite and by the satellite, as a result of operations against it. For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC) as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations. For example, Article 35 of the ITC prohibits harmful interference with the radio spectrum.\nAll stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognized\n *Id.* art. III.\n *Id.* art. VI(1).\n *Id.* art. VI(2).\n See, e.g., Wingfield, *supra* note 18, at 327-328.\n See, e.g., *id.*\n See International Telecommunication Union, About ITU, http://www.itu.int/net/about/index.aspx (last visited Sept. 14, 2009). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency responsible for promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunication.\n International Telecommunications Convention, Nairobi, Nov. 6, 1982, 32 U.S.T. 3821 [hereinafter ITU Convention].\n\nprivate operating agencies, or of other duly authorized operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.\nHarmful interference is defined as “interference which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations.”\nArticle 37 of the ITC may also impact cyber warfare operations. It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country. Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.\nArticle 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.” This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used . . .” Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services. An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals. This prohibition does not\n Id. art. 35\n Id. annex 2.\n Id. art. 37.\n Id. art. 19(2).\n Id. art. 20.\n Id. art. 38(1).\n Id. art. 38(2).\n Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n See LAWRENCE T.

Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency. As a result, while a state may, under certain circumstances, block or suspend international communications, it may not lawfully spoof communications. However, there is ample precedent that provisions of international communication conventions are suspended between belligerents engaged in armed conflicts.\n## C. International Aviation Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of, or interference with, civilian aviation may implicate numerous international aviation laws. Such operations may involve disrupting an air traffic control tower, modifying a flight’s passenger list, or adding a name to a no-fly list. These types of operations have the potential to result in a delay or cancellation of flights, thereby interrupting travel plans of targeted belligerents.\n## 1. The Convention on International Civil Aviation\nThe primary international law governing aviation is the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention. This Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft\n *Id.*\n See Dep’t of Defense General Counsel, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* 33 (May 1999), available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf.\n Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, Dec. 7, 1944, 15 U.N.T.S. 295, [hereinafter Chicago Convention].\n\nregistration, and safety. The Convention is supported by eighteen annexes containing standards and recommended practices; these annexes are amended regularly by ICAO. Annex 17 sets out the basis for the ICAO civil aviation security program and seeks to safeguard civil aviation and its facilities against acts of unlawful interference. This Annex requires that each member state “have as its primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public in all matters related to safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation.”\nA 1998 amendment to the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircraft. Article 3 bis(a) specifically states that “the contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight . . .” Article 89 of the Chicago Convention allows a contracting state to disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency.\n[I]n case of war, the provisions of this Convention shall not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States affected, whether as belligerents or as neutrals. The same principle shall apply in the case of any contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies the fact to the Council.\nCyber warfare operations targeting civilian aviation may run afoul of a state’s obligation under the Chicago Convention to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Additionally, if a cyber warfare operation targets an aircraft in flight, the operation very well may be a violation of the Article 3bis requirement to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

This national emergency exception may provide some latitude in conducting cyber warfare operations in situations short of war.\n## 2. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation\nThe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention of 1971, makes specific conduct unlawful. Article 1 provides that a person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally does or attempts to do any of the following:\n[1] performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft; [2] destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight; [3] places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to endanger its safety in flight; [4] destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight; or, [5] communicates information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.\nThis Convention may limit the ability to conduct cyber warfare operations that interfere with an aircraft’s operating system, if such an operation would render the aircraft incapable of flight. Additionally, this Convention may also place a prohibition on interfering with the networks of air navigation facilities, as it essentially prohibits the ability to disrupt air traffic control communications or other aspects of air\n Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 564 [hereinafter Montreal Convention].\n Id. art. 1(1)(a).\n Id. art. 1(1)(b).\n Id. art. 1(1)(c).\n Id. art. 1(1)(d).\n Id. art. 1(1)(e).\n\nnavigation, if it interferes with their operation and endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight. Finally, this Convention may prohibit cyber warfare operations from spoofing communication if it would endanger the safety of an aircraft. However, nothing in this Convention appears to limit cyber warfare operations that do not render a flight unable to fly or endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight.\n## 3. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation\nThe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death” or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.” This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n## D. Arms Control Treaties\nArms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification. For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in\n Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n Id. art. II, para 1..\n Id.\n Wingfield, supra note 18, at 330.\nCyber Warfare Operations 169\naccordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\" This agreement also provided that “each Party undertakes not to use deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the provisions of this Interim Agreement.” This became standard language in arms control treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union as evidenced by the language in Article XV of the 1979 Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and Protocol Thereto (SALT II), which states that “paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are adopted verbatim from the first two paragraphs of Article XII of the ABM Treaty and Article V of the Interim Agreement.” The third paragraph of this Article prohibits deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the Treaty.\nArms control treaties that place a prohibition on interfering with the national technical means of a state may limit the ability of both states to conduct cyber warfare operations against the intelligence collecting capabilities of the other. However, arms control treaties, like other treaties except those defining laws of war, are suspended during war between parties. Therefore, cyber warfare operations that interfere with military reconnaissance satellites used for arms control verification may violate the treaty. However, during hostilities these satellites would become a proper military objective.\n## E. Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime\nThe Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks. The main objective of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation. The U.S. ratified the Cybercrime\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nConvention in 2006. $^{334}$ This Convention covers a broad range of criminal conduct broken up into four categories: offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems; $^{335}$ computer-related offenses; $^{336}$ content-related offenses; $^{337}$ and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. $^{338}$\nCyber Warfare Operations would most likely run afoul of the offenses described within the first category, in particular Articles 2 through 5, which relate to illegal access, illegal interception, data interference, and system interference, respectively. $^{339}$ However, its rules do not apply to government activities, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. $^{340}$ For example, Article 2 requires states to adopt “legislative and other measures” to establish as criminal offenses under their domestic law intentional “access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right.” $^{341}$ The accompanying Explanatory Report clarifies that the “without right” caveat “leaves unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority,” including acts to “protect national security or investigate criminal offences.” $^{342}$ Nevertheless, this Convention still poses potential problems for conducting cyber warfare operations. For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other . . . to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” $^{343}$ This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\nCyber Warfare Operations 171\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IX. CONCLUSION\nNothing in international law explicitly prohibits cyber warfare operations. However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports. Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.\nDespite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology. The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry. In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons. In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place\n See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n Id. at 1032.\n Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n Id.\n Id.\non the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers . . . .\"349 I contend that the future Mr. Kuryanovich discusses is now, and that now is the time for states to determine what is and is not permitted under international law in relation to cyber warfare operations. Failure to do so now may result in overly restrictive, reactionary regulations in response to a cyber Pearl Harbor-like attack, rather than a well thought out, proactive, structured approach.\nCyber Warfare Operations 173",

INTRODUCTION\nIn 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.” He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy. States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults. The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.” NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”\nAs states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield. One commentator noted:\nThe rapid advancement of cyber attacks and the emergence of cyber warfare have caught government\nCyber Warfare Operations 123\n Randall Mikkelsen, U.S. Not Ready for Cyber Attack, REUTERS, Dec. 19, 2008, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4BI00520081219 (quoting Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security).\n John A.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.\nFor over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur. Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons. Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers. As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare. However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions. While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict, the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not” and that “Russia retains the right\n Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS\nTo develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n## A. Cyberspace\nWhile there is no internationally accepted definition of \"cyberspace,\" numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines \"cyberspace\" as \"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\" Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition. \"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the\nCyber Warfare Operations 125\nWorld Wide Web.” A 2001 Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress defined “cyberspace” as the “total interconnectedness of human beings through computers and telecommunication without regard to physical geography.”\nThese multiple definitions of “cyberspace” illustrate the difficulty in defining the term, which may be one of the difficulties in creating any type of common agreement among states as to how international law should be applied to warfare conducted in cyberspace. I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”\n## B. Cyber Warfare\nAs with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.” The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.” Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.” This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt,\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nor usurp information resident in or transiting through networks.” A 2001 CRS Report for Congress, notes that “[c]yberwarfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.” A 2006 CRS Report for Congress defined the phrase “computer network attack” as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks.” Kevin Coleman, a Senior Fellow and Strategic Management Consultant at the Technolytics Institute, an independent executive think tank, defined “cyber war” as “a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.”\nThese various definitions again illustrate the difficulty in defining what is meant by “cyber warfare.” Recognizing that military operations in cyberspace could be viewed as warfare, I propose the phrase “cyber warfare operations” be used in analyzing the wide range of military operations in cyberspace and suggest the following definition: “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state.”\n## III. DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nThis section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n## A. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in the United States\nThe current state of planning for cyber warfare operations has been likened to the early years following the invention of the atomic\nCyber Warfare Operations 127\nbomb a half-century ago, when thinking about how to wage nuclear war lagged behind the ability to launch one. Richard A. Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.” However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon. This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.” In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.” This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.\nAlso in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.” This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.” One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces\n Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Since 2003, there has been a gradual development of incorporating cyber warfare into military doctrine and in creating an organizational structure for managing cyber warfare operations, highlighted most recently by the establishment of the 24th Air Force, a new numbered air force focused on the cyber mission.\n## 1. Doctrine\nDepartment of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security. This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.” It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”\nJoint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations. This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.” It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure. This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three\n *Id.* at 49.\n U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n *Id.* at 2.\n *Id.*\n JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n *Id.* at II-4\n *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\nCyber Warfare Operations 129\ncategories: computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.\nFinally, Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 provides guidance for planning and conducting Air Force information operations to support the warfighter and achieve national strategy objectives. This Directive states that Air Force information operations consist of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations, network warfare operations, and influence operations. It also notes that network operations are comprised of network attack, network defense, and network warfare support.\n## 2. Organization\nThe U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is one of 10 unified commands under the Department of Defense. Part of USSTRATCOM’s mission is to ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and to deliver integrated kinetic and non-kinetic effects, including information operations, in support of Joint Force Commander operations. USSTRATCOM helps plan and coordinate offensive computer operations across military and defense agencies through what it calls the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).\nJFCC-NW plans and, when directed, executes operations in and through cyberspace, assuring U.S. and allied forces freedom of action, denying adversaries’ freedom of action, and enabling effects beyond the cyber domain. One of the key roles for the JFCC-NW is to foster new lines of communication for network warfare-related activities, bringing together the various organizations within the military that work in this area. Additional key tasks for JFCC-NW are to develop standard procedures and doctrine for network warfare activities and ensure that U.S. forces have the tools they need to wage network warfare today and in the future.\n\nIn March 2005, the National Defense Strategy identified cyberspace as a new theater of operations. Also in 2005, the Air Force mission statement expanded to reflect that cyberspace was now an official Air Force domain: “to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.” In 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace. Also in 2006, the Air Force stood up the 67th Network Warfare Wing. “The Air Force established the 67th Network Warfare Wing to have an organization solely focused on ensuring that our networks are able to operate in time of peace and war and to have the capability to deal with potential adversaries who may be trying to exploit our networks.” The 67th Network Warfare Wing provides full spectrum network operations from the offensive capabilities of assessment, exploitation, and attack to operating and defending Air Force networks. In 2007, demonstrating another step in the Air Force's move to develop an organizational structure for fighting in cyberspace, the Air Force announced it would be officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command. This plan, however, was altered slightly in 2008 when the Air Force announced that, instead of creating a new major command, it would be standing up a component numbered air force that would focus on cyberspace warfighting operations.\n Kevin B.

Training\nThe Air Force has also implemented new training in the realm of cyber warfare operations. All Airmen, officer and enlisted, will be taught about cyber warfare in their initial accession training. In addition, approximately 100 students per year will receive more advanced instruction at the Undergraduate Network Warfare Training course, where graduates of the six-month program will be able to operate a computer like a weapon system.\n## B. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in other States\nA number of states are also incorporating cyber warfare as a new part of their military doctrine. This section will briefly examine cyber warfare operations in China, Russia, and North Korea.\n### 1. Development in China\nChina currently possesses a significant cyber weapons and intelligence infrastructure, and their cyber warfare doctrine is designed to achieve global “electronic dominance” by 2050. This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies. In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.” According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others. A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks. A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers. In 2005, the PLA began to\n---\n Brook, supra note 57.\n Id.\n Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n Alexander, supra note 53.\n Coleman, supra note 63.\n U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia\nRussia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine, with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention. Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force. Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.\n## 3. Development in North Korea\nIn 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception. North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.\nCyber Warfare Operations 133\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IV. WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nIn the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state. It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place. This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack\nA DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.” It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service. One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system. DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations. In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W. Williamson III wrote:\nAmerica needs a network that can project power by building an af.mil robot network (botnet) that can direct\n---\n Coleman, supra note 27.\n Id.\n TechWeb.Com, Technocyclopedia, Denial of Service Attack, http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=denialofserviceattack (last visited Sept. 1, 2009).\n CERT Coordination Center, Denial of Service Attacks, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n Id.\n Nono, Botnets fight back with Denial of service attacks!!, PC1NEWS.COM, Sep 12, 2008, http://www.pc1news.com/news/0221/botnets-fight-back-with-denial-of-service-attacks-.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n Kevin Coleman, Department of Cyber Defense, An organization who’s time has come!, TECHNOLOGY, Nov. 2007, at 2, available at http://www.technolytics.com/Dept_of_Cyber_Defense.pdf.\nsuch massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic. America needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack.\nA Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.\n## B. Malicious Programs\nMalicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer. An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers. The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software. Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable. Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.\nA virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another. The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself. In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload. Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data\n Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98\nA Trojan horse is \"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103\nA blended threat is \"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nvulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack, which means they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage.\nPolymorphic malware is “malicious software that has the ability to change its signature randomly each time it replicates.” This technique is used to avoid detection by anti-spyware programs designed to recognize malware by its signature. With polymorphic malware, only the appearance of the code is altered, not the function.\n## C. Logic Bomb\nA logic bomb is malicious code designed to execute if specific events occur or at a predetermined time. Once triggered, it can take down the computer, delete data, or activate a DoS attack by generating bogus transactions.\n## D. IP Spoofing\nIP spoofing, also known as IP address forgery or a host file hijack, is a hijacking technique in which hijackers masquerade as a trusted host to conceal their identity, spoof a Website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network. When IP spoofing is used to hijack a browser, a visitor who types in the uniform resource locator (URL) of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent web page created by the hijacker. If the user interacts with dynamic content on a spoofed page, the hijacker can gain access to sensitive information or computer or network resources.\n## E. Digital Manipulation\nDigital image manipulation is the alteration of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, which often reflects new meaning. This technique involves already existing imagery, such as photographs or videos.\nCyber Warfare Operations\n\nIt is now possible to manipulate video in real time. In the fraction of a second between video frames, any person or object moving in the foreground can be edited out, and objects that aren't there can be edited in and made to look real. This fluidity stems from the changeable nature of the pixels that make up modern video. It is now possible to insert sets of pixels into satellite imagery data that interpreters would view as battalions of tanks or war planes. Princeton Video Imaging (PVI) bolstered this point in a demo tape set in a suburban parking lot. The scene appeared ordinary except for amidst the SUVs and minivans are several parked tanks and one armored behemoth rolling incongruously along. Deleting people or objects from live video, or inserting prerecorded people or objects into live scenes, is only the beginning. The video manipulators can make previously recorded speakers say and do things they never actually said or did. In addition, modern technology compresses what used to take an hour into a sixtieth of a second, which permits real-time manipulation as a camera records or broadcasts.\nThe combination of real-time, virtual insertion with existing and emerging post-production techniques opens up a world of manipulative\n See, e.g., HANY FARID, PHOTO TAMPERING THROUGHOUT HISTORY, http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n See Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security, Photo Alteration, http://www.espionageinfo.com/Pa-Po/Photo-Alteration.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Id.\n See Yaakov Lappin, Reuters Admits to More Image Manipulation, YNETNEWS.COM, Aug. 7, 2006, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287774,00.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Ivan Amato, Lying With Pixels, Seeing is No Longer believing, TECH.

For example, one could insert a world leader into a live broadcast of CNN and have the individual say whatever one wishes. Additionally, states could create completely fabricated real time webcasts showing their adversaries doing whatever they deem appropriate for their purposes. James Currie, a professor of political science at the National Defense University, who also has experience as a staffer with TOP SECRET clearance on the Senate’s Intelligence Committee and as a legislative liaison for the Secretary of the Army, is convinced that the military and intelligence communities will, or already do, possess real-time video manipulation capabilities. Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators considered creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or getting caught in a sexually compromising situation and then distributing the tapes in Iraq and the Arab world.\nVoice morphing enables the cloning of speech patterns and creation of an accurate copy of a person's voice, which can then say anything the operator wishes it to say, appearing to be the voice of someone else. George Papcun of the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed this technology. The Washington Post detailed how Mr. Papcun could, in near real time, clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile by using just a 10-minute digital recording.\n## V. CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO ESPIONAGE\nA large amount of the cyber operations performed by a military will involve the collection of data or intelligence stored on another state’s network or analyzing the configuration of the network. These types of actions, provided they do not disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, should not be considered cyber warfare operations. The international community should view such activities as a form of espionage or cyber espionage. Espionage is the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting,\n Id.\n Id.\n William M.

The Department of Defense uses the term “computer network exploitation” to describe “enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks.” Another term that fits under this category of cyber espionage is what the Air Force calls “network warfare support,” which is defined as “actions tasked by or under direct control of an operational commander to search for, intercept, identify, and locate or localize sources of access and vulnerability for the purpose of immediate threat recognition, targeting, planning, and conduct of future operations.” Network warfare support “provides information required for immediate decisions involving network warfare operations” and “can be used to produce intelligence, or provide targeting for electronic or destructive attack.”\nArticle 24 of the Annex to the 1907 Hague Convention IV recognizes the lawfulness of espionage during armed conflict, specifically providing that “ruses of war and the employment of measures necessary for obtaining information about the enemy and the country are considered permissible.” No international convention has ever addressed the legality of peacetime espionage and espionage has been practiced by states for centuries. Additionally, international law does not prohibit espionage as a fundamentally wrongful activity.\nThomas Wingfield, a Research Fellow at the Potomac Institute, concluded that the right to conduct espionage is an essential part of a state’s inherent right of self-defense and stated, “the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations recognizes the well-established right of nations to engage in espionage during peacetime and the practice of states has specifically recognized a right to engage in such clandestine intelligence collection activities as an inherent part of foreign relations and policy.” Individual states have, however, enacted laws that severely punish espionage against their own\n See Joint Pub. 1-02, supra note 17, at 190.\n Id. at 113.\n AFPD 10-7, supra note 23, at 20.\n Id.\n Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and its annex: Regulation Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, art. 24, Oct. 18, 1907, 36 Stat. 2277, 1 Bevans 631 [hereinafter Hague Convention IV].\n Roger D.

In general, espionage is treated as lawful under public international law and unlawful under domestic law.\nTwo examples of activities viewed as cyber espionage are the Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain incidents. These two incidents demonstrate how espionage in the computer age has changed. Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information. According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities. In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks. Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is . . . They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.” Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”\nTitan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003. The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain. The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military. The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation\n Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE\nThe maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations. The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter. Article 2(3) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members states “shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.” Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.” Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . .\nIn *Nicaragua v. United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.” Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter. If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law. However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 143\nIn April 2007, important websites in Estonia, including the website of the president, parliament, ministries, political parties, major news outlets, and Estonia’s two dominant banks, were hit by a series of DoS attacks. These attacks continued until mid-June. A Defense Ministry spokesman said sites that usually received 1,000 visits a day were buried under as many as 2,000 a second. Officials in Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks and security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian servers, including domains registered to the government and to the administration of then President Putin. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia’s complaints as fabrications. Estonia reported the attacks to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe NATO Treaty, which Estonia and most EU Member States are a party to, provides that an attack on one of its members shall be considered an attack against all and enables party nations to exercise the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter. Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo called the attacks a national security situation and compared the situation to the shutdown of sea ports. This comparison is interesting as Article 3(c) of the General Assembly’s resolution defining aggression lists “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State” as an act of aggression. However, it should be noted that Article 41 of the U.N. Charter cites “complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.” After discussing the situation with NATO officials, Mr. Aaviksoo stated, “at present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action.

Some in NATO now believe the attacks were Russia testing the West's preparedness for cyber-warfare in general and of NATO's commitment to its newest, weakest members in particular.\nThe debate as to whether this type of cyber warfare operation could be considered a use of force was re-energized in August 2008, following accusations that Russia was behind attacks on Georgian government sites shortly before the launching of Russian military action. On August 7, 2008, following separatist provocations, Georgian forces launched a surprise attack against the separatist forces. On August 8, Russia responded to Georgia’s act with military operations into Georgian territory, which the Georgian authorities viewed as military aggression against Georgia. The evening of August 7, before the Russian invasion into Georgia commenced, cyber attacks were already being launched against a large number of Georgian governmental websites, making it among the first cases in which a coordinated cyber offensive accompanied, or even preceded, an international political and military conflict. As with the Estonian incident, there is no conclusive proof of who was behind the attacks. However, the level of advance preparation and reconnaissance strongly suggested that officials within the Russian government or military primed Russian hackers for the assault. Scott Borg, director of the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit, a think tank that advises governments and companies, stated at the time, “we are in a world where governments have not decided yet whether the tools of cyberattacks are\n Ryan, supra note 159.\n Cyber War as the Ultimate Weapon, STRATEGYWORLD.COM, Jan. 5, 2008, http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htiw/articles/20080105.aspx (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n Anne Applebaum, For Estonia and NATO, A New Kind of War, WASH.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition. The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services. However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either. Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state. This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”\nWhat level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force. But what about the interfering with, or disruption of, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, and nuclear power plant safety systems? This is likely one of the next scenarios regarding the issue of\n Siobhan Gorman, Cyberattacks on Georgian Web Sites Are Reigniting a Washington Debate, WALL ST.

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down. The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke. While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States. Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities. Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet. These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands. This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51, and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, has argued that an action can be defined as an armed attack if that action is intended to cause injury, death,\n Ted Bridis &amp; Eileen Sullivan, *US Video Shows Hacker Hit on Power Grid*, SFGATE.COM (SAN.

While there is currently nothing affirming that a cyber attack equates to an unlawful use of force or armed attacked under international law, using Schmitt’s analysis a cyber attack that has the potential to cause, or actually causes, physical damage, injury, or death would constitute a use of force or an armed attack. This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case. This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it. In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law” and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.” Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR\nCyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare. Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n### A. General Principles of the Law of War\n#### 1. Military Necessity\nThe principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible. U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863. Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect\n Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1, 6 (2005).\nCyber Warfare Operations 149\ncustomary international law. It states that a military attack is lawful only against “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”\n## 2. Distinction\nAccording to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives. Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations” and also “the civilian population . . . as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.” Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”\n## 3. Proportionality\nThe principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective. Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage\n Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum. Law, Cambridge, Jan. 27-29, 2003), available at http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/pdfs/Session1.pdf.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 52(2), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n Sassòli, supra note 200, at 1. Additional Protocol I, Article 48, states this basic rule as, “the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Additional Protocol I, art. 48.\n Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 13(1), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609, [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n Additional Protocol II, art. 13(2).\n Id. art. 13(3).\n Rod Powers, Law of Armed Conflict, ABOUT.COM: US MILITARY, at 2, http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n\ngained. The law of war requires one to weigh the expected collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by the operation. The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,” (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,” and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.” Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.\n## 4. Unnecessary Suffering\nHague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.” Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.” This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n## 5. Perfidy\nTreacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other. Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.\nCyber Warfare Operations 151\nPerfidy involves injuring the enemy by using his adherence to the law of war against him. Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1), also states, “it is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy” and “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.” Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare*, provides:\nThe line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct, but the following examples indicate the correct principles. It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.\nBecause cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy. Such misinformation is synonymous with any other method for delivering misinformation.\n## 6. Neutrality\nNeutrality is an essential tenet of international law. Neutrality affords states the right to maintain relations with all belligerents. States that declare themselves neutral, and behave\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 37(1).\n *Id.* The following examples are provided: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status, and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.\n FM 27-10, *supra* note 198, ¶ 50.\n See Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n *Korns* &amp; *Kastenberg*, *supra* note 12, at 73.\n *Id.* at 62.\n\naccordingly, are entitled to immunity from attack. Under the principle of neutrality a neutral state’s territory is to be secure from assault or trespass. Also, belligerents are forbidden from moving troops, munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral state. However, should the neutral state fail for any reason to prevent violations of its neutrality by the troops of one belligerent entering or passing through its territory, the other belligerent may be justified in attacking the enemy forces on this territory. Authors in the cyber law arena have suggested that in order to remain neutral in a cyber conflict a state cannot originate a cyber attack, and it also has to take action to prevent a cyber attack from transiting its internet nodes.\nNeutrality becomes problematic for cyber warfare operations because the weapons of cyber warfare, such as requests being sent by computer systems from which DoS attacks originate or the malicious code that travels along networks, cannot always be predicted. For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another. Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.\n## B. Targeting\nMilitary objectives are legitimate targets. Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage.” Objects which, by their nature, make an effective contribution to military action would include objects directly used by the armed force, such as: weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots, buildings occupied by armed forces, staff\n Id.\n Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 26 Stat. 2310, U.S.T. 540 (which states “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable”) [hereinafter Hague Convention V].\n Id. art. 2.\n FM 27-10 supra note 198, ¶ 520.\n Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 12, at 62; Jeffrey T.G.

Location refers to objects that by their nature have no military function but by virtue of their location make an effective contribution to military action, such as a bridge. Purpose is concerned with the intended future use of an object, while use is concerned with its present function. Most civilian objects can become useful objects to the armed forces; for example, a school or a hotel is a civilian object, but if used to accommodate troops or headquarters staff, it becomes a military objective. If there is a doubt concerning the purpose, such place must be presumed to serve civilian purposes.\nNext, review the phrase “definite military advantage.” This phrase makes it illegitimate to launch an attack which only offers potential or indeterminate advantages. Now that we have defined the phrase “military objectives,” the next step is to examine specific types of targets, specifically, people, places, and dual-use targets.\n1. Targeting People\nPeople can be divided into two categories: combatants and non-combatants. Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains. These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities. Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.” Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.” Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.\n Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n Id.\n Id. art. 43(1).\n Id. art. 44(3).\n Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III]. These requirements include “being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;”\n\nUnlike combatants, the law of war prohibits direct attacks on non-combatants. Non-combatants may be divided into two groups: civilians and enemy personnel out of combat. A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities. The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited. Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.” The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n## 2. Targeting Places\nHague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended. Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack . . .” Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.” Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” This\nwear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.*\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n *Id.* art. 51(2).\n *Id.*\n *Id.* art. 51(3).\n Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n *Id.* art. 52(3).\n *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and\nCyber Warfare Operations 155\nprotection terminates, however, if the enemy is using them in specific ways to support its war effort.\nMoreover, “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” It needs to be noted that the U.S. has not ratified Additional Protocol I and specifically objects, for military reasons, to Article 56. The objection is that this Article disregards the longstanding principle of proportionality and prohibits the attack if there are to be “severe” civilian losses, no matter how important the target may be from a military point of view.\n## 3. Dual-Use Targets\nDual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers. Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.\nAs previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker. The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military\ndirect support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n Id.\n Id. art. 56(1).\n See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows:\nDual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257\nThe international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 157\nC. Analysis\nCyber warfare operations have the capability of being a very effective option during an armed conflict. Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters. However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system. Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.” This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared\n Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n Id.\n Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n\nto a conventional attack intended to accomplish the same results, and would therefore be lawful.\nA more difficult example to analyze is the altering of electronic maintenance manuals of an adversary’s aircraft stored on a network. While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks. Deleting military files, or even the\n A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. See Webopedia.com, network, http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/n/network.html (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\nCyber Warfare Operations 159\nannihilation of military computer networks, would constitute a proper military objective. These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted, \"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"\n## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nThe law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility. This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law. The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act. Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations. This section will examine a few areas states should consider when developing plans for cyber warfare operations.\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nA. International Outer Space Law\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was created by the U.N. in 1959. The purpose of COPUOS is to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise U.N. programs in this field, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space. COPUOS is the only international forum for the development of international space law. Since its inception, the Committee concluded five international legal instruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities. The five international treaties are: the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty), the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement), the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention), the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention), and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Moon Treaty). The Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention both include language that may impact cyber warfare operations.\n G.A.

Res. 34/68, annex, Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (July 11, 1984).\nCyber Warfare Operations 161\n\n# 1. Outer Space Treaty\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space. While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military. However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful. The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere. Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .” The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state. Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.\n UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n See Major Robert A. Ramey, *Armed Conflict on the Final Frontier: The Law of War in Space*, 48 A.F. L. REV. 1, 79 (2000).\n Id.\n Id.\n Id.\n Id. at 77; Outer Space Treaty, supra note 272, art. IX.\n Id.\n Id.\nSpace assets also create dual-use issues, specifically regarding commercial assets. For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes. Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military. As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military. A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n## 2. Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n *Id.* at 148-149.\n Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F. L. REV. 157, 200 (2004) (citing Katie McConnell, *Military Satellite Communications: The March Toward Commercialization*, DEFENSE DAILY (2003)).\n See Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 51(5)(b).\n *Ramey*, *supra* note 278, at 150.\n *Id.*\n *Liability Convention*, *supra* note 274, art. II.\nCyber Warfare Operations 163\nis the state’s fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible. The Convention provides exoneration from absolute liability to the extent that a launching state establishes the damage resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant state. However, no exoneration will be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching state which are not in conformity with international law.\nTherefore, a state conducting cyber warfare operations against another state’s satellite may be liable to the launching state for the damage done to the satellite and by the satellite, as a result of operations against it. For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC) as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations. For example, Article 35 of the ITC prohibits harmful interference with the radio spectrum.\nAll stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognized\n *Id.* art. III.\n *Id.* art. VI(1).\n *Id.* art. VI(2).\n See, e.g., Wingfield, *supra* note 18, at 327-328.\n See, e.g., *id.*\n See International Telecommunication Union, About ITU, http://www.itu.int/net/about/index.aspx (last visited Sept. 14, 2009). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency responsible for promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunication.\n International Telecommunications Convention, Nairobi, Nov. 6, 1982, 32 U.S.T. 3821 [hereinafter ITU Convention].\n\nprivate operating agencies, or of other duly authorized operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.\nHarmful interference is defined as “interference which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations.”\nArticle 37 of the ITC may also impact cyber warfare operations. It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country. Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.\nArticle 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.” This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used . . .” Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services. An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals. This prohibition does not\n Id. art. 35\n Id. annex 2.\n Id. art. 37.\n Id. art. 19(2).\n Id. art. 20.\n Id. art. 38(1).\n Id. art. 38(2).\n Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n See LAWRENCE T.

Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency. As a result, while a state may, under certain circumstances, block or suspend international communications, it may not lawfully spoof communications. However, there is ample precedent that provisions of international communication conventions are suspended between belligerents engaged in armed conflicts.\n## C. International Aviation Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of, or interference with, civilian aviation may implicate numerous international aviation laws. Such operations may involve disrupting an air traffic control tower, modifying a flight’s passenger list, or adding a name to a no-fly list. These types of operations have the potential to result in a delay or cancellation of flights, thereby interrupting travel plans of targeted belligerents.\n## 1. The Convention on International Civil Aviation\nThe primary international law governing aviation is the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention. This Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft\n *Id.*\n See Dep’t of Defense General Counsel, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* 33 (May 1999), available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf.\n Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, Dec. 7, 1944, 15 U.N.T.S. 295, [hereinafter Chicago Convention].\n\nregistration, and safety. The Convention is supported by eighteen annexes containing standards and recommended practices; these annexes are amended regularly by ICAO. Annex 17 sets out the basis for the ICAO civil aviation security program and seeks to safeguard civil aviation and its facilities against acts of unlawful interference. This Annex requires that each member state “have as its primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public in all matters related to safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation.”\nA 1998 amendment to the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircraft. Article 3 bis(a) specifically states that “the contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight . . .” Article 89 of the Chicago Convention allows a contracting state to disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency.\n[I]n case of war, the provisions of this Convention shall not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States affected, whether as belligerents or as neutrals. The same principle shall apply in the case of any contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies the fact to the Council.\nCyber warfare operations targeting civilian aviation may run afoul of a state’s obligation under the Chicago Convention to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Additionally, if a cyber warfare operation targets an aircraft in flight, the operation very well may be a violation of the Article 3bis requirement to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation\nThe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention of 1971, makes specific conduct unlawful. Article 1 provides that a person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally does or attempts to do any of the following:\n[1] performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft; [2] destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight; [3] places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to endanger its safety in flight; [4] destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight; or, [5] communicates information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.\nThis Convention may limit the ability to conduct cyber warfare operations that interfere with an aircraft’s operating system, if such an operation would render the aircraft incapable of flight. Additionally, this Convention may also place a prohibition on interfering with the networks of air navigation facilities, as it essentially prohibits the ability to disrupt air traffic control communications or other aspects of air\n Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 564 [hereinafter Montreal Convention].\n Id. art. 1(1)(a).\n Id. art. 1(1)(b).\n Id. art. 1(1)(c).\n Id. art. 1(1)(d).\n Id. art. 1(1)(e).\n\nnavigation, if it interferes with their operation and endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight. Finally, this Convention may prohibit cyber warfare operations from spoofing communication if it would endanger the safety of an aircraft. However, nothing in this Convention appears to limit cyber warfare operations that do not render a flight unable to fly or endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight.\n## 3. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation\nThe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death” or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.” This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n## D. Arms Control Treaties\nArms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification. For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in\n Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n Id. art. II, para 1..\n Id.\n Wingfield, supra note 18, at 330.\nCyber Warfare Operations 169\naccordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\" This agreement also provided that “each Party undertakes not to use deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the provisions of this Interim Agreement.” This became standard language in arms control treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union as evidenced by the language in Article XV of the 1979 Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and Protocol Thereto (SALT II), which states that “paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are adopted verbatim from the first two paragraphs of Article XII of the ABM Treaty and Article V of the Interim Agreement.” The third paragraph of this Article prohibits deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the Treaty.\nArms control treaties that place a prohibition on interfering with the national technical means of a state may limit the ability of both states to conduct cyber warfare operations against the intelligence collecting capabilities of the other. However, arms control treaties, like other treaties except those defining laws of war, are suspended during war between parties. Therefore, cyber warfare operations that interfere with military reconnaissance satellites used for arms control verification may violate the treaty. However, during hostilities these satellites would become a proper military objective.\n## E. Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime\nThe Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks. The main objective of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation. The U.S. ratified the Cybercrime\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nConvention in 2006. $^{334}$ This Convention covers a broad range of criminal conduct broken up into four categories: offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems; $^{335}$ computer-related offenses; $^{336}$ content-related offenses; $^{337}$ and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. $^{338}$\nCyber Warfare Operations would most likely run afoul of the offenses described within the first category, in particular Articles 2 through 5, which relate to illegal access, illegal interception, data interference, and system interference, respectively. $^{339}$ However, its rules do not apply to government activities, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. $^{340}$ For example, Article 2 requires states to adopt “legislative and other measures” to establish as criminal offenses under their domestic law intentional “access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right.” $^{341}$ The accompanying Explanatory Report clarifies that the “without right” caveat “leaves unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority,” including acts to “protect national security or investigate criminal offences.” $^{342}$ Nevertheless, this Convention still poses potential problems for conducting cyber warfare operations. For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other . . . to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” $^{343}$ This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\nCyber Warfare Operations 171\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IX. CONCLUSION\nNothing in international law explicitly prohibits cyber warfare operations. However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports. Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.\nDespite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology. The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry. In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons. In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place\n See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n Id. at 1032.\n Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n Id.\n Id.\non the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers . . . .\"349 I contend that the future Mr. Kuryanovich discusses is now, and that now is the time for states to determine what is and is not permitted under international law in relation to cyber warfare operations. Failure to do so now may result in overly restrictive, reactionary regulations in response to a cyber Pearl Harbor-like attack, rather than a well thought out, proactive, structured approach.\nCyber Warfare Operations 173"

INTRODUCTION\nIn 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.”² He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”³\nAs of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy.⁴ States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults.⁵ The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.”⁶ NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”⁷\nAs states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.⁸\nFor over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur.⁹ Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons.¹⁰ Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers.¹¹ As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare.¹² However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions.¹³ While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict,¹⁴ the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not”¹⁵ and that “Russia retains the right\n⁸ Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁹ Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS\nTo develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n## A. Cyberspace\nWhile there is no internationally accepted definition of \"cyberspace,\" numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines \"cyberspace\" as \"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"¹⁷ Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition. \"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the\nCyber Warfare Operations 125\nWorld Wide Web.”¹⁸ A 2001 Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress defined “cyberspace” as the “total interconnectedness of human beings through computers and telecommunication without regard to physical geography.”¹⁹\nThese multiple definitions of “cyberspace” illustrate the difficulty in defining the term, which may be one of the difficulties in creating any type of common agreement among states as to how international law should be applied to warfare conducted in cyberspace. I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”²⁰\n## B. Cyber Warfare\nAs with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.”²¹ The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”²² Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.”²³ This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt,\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nor usurp information resident in or transiting through networks.”²⁴ A 2001 CRS Report for Congress, notes that “[c]yberwarfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”²⁵ A 2006 CRS Report for Congress defined the phrase “computer network attack” as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks.”²⁶ Kevin Coleman, a Senior Fellow and Strategic Management Consultant at the Technolytics Institute, an independent executive think tank, defined “cyber war” as “a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.”²⁷\nThese various definitions again illustrate the difficulty in defining what is meant by “cyber warfare.” Recognizing that military operations in cyberspace could be viewed as warfare, I propose the phrase “cyber warfare operations” be used in analyzing the wide range of military operations in cyberspace and suggest the following definition: “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state.”\n## III. DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nThis section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n## A. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in the United States\nThe current state of planning for cyber warfare operations has been likened to the early years following the invention of the atomic\nCyber Warfare Operations 127\nbomb a half-century ago, when thinking about how to wage nuclear war lagged behind the ability to launch one.²⁸ Richard A. Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.”²⁹ However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon.³⁰ This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.”³¹ In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.”³² This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.³³\nAlso in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.”³⁴ This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.”³⁵ One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces\n²⁸ Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Doctrine\nDepartment of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security.³⁷ This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.”³⁸ It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”³⁹\nJoint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations.⁴⁰ This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.”⁴¹ It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure.⁴² This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three\n³⁶ *Id.* at 49.\n³⁷ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n³⁸ *Id.* at 2.\n³⁹ *Id.*\n⁴⁰ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n⁴¹ *Id.* at II-4\n⁴² *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\nCyber Warfare Operations 129\ncategories: computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.⁴³\nFinally, Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 provides guidance for planning and conducting Air Force information operations to support the warfighter and achieve national strategy objectives.⁴⁴ This Directive states that Air Force information operations consist of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations, network warfare operations, and influence operations.⁴⁵ It also notes that network operations are comprised of network attack, network defense, and network warfare support.⁴⁶\n## 2. Organization\nThe U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is one of 10 unified commands under the Department of Defense. Part of USSTRATCOM’s mission is to ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and to deliver integrated kinetic and non-kinetic effects, including information operations, in support of Joint Force Commander operations.⁴⁷ USSTRATCOM helps plan and coordinate offensive computer operations across military and defense agencies through what it calls the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).⁴⁸\nJFCC-NW plans and, when directed, executes operations in and through cyberspace, assuring U.S. and allied forces freedom of action, denying adversaries’ freedom of action, and enabling effects beyond the cyber domain.⁴⁹ One of the key roles for the JFCC-NW is to foster new lines of communication for network warfare-related activities, bringing together the various organizations within the military that work in this area.⁵⁰ Additional key tasks for JFCC-NW are to develop standard procedures and doctrine for network warfare activities⁵¹ and ensure that U.S. forces have the tools they need to wage network warfare today and in the future.⁵²\n130 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nIn March 2005, the National Defense Strategy identified cyberspace as a new theater of operations.⁵³ Also in 2005, the Air Force mission statement expanded to reflect that cyberspace was now an official Air Force domain: “to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.”⁵⁴ In 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace.⁵⁵ Also in 2006, the Air Force stood up the 67th Network Warfare Wing.⁵⁶ “The Air Force established the 67th Network Warfare Wing to have an organization solely focused on ensuring that our networks are able to operate in time of peace and war and to have the capability to deal with potential adversaries who may be trying to exploit our networks.”⁵⁷ The 67th Network Warfare Wing provides full spectrum network operations from the offensive capabilities of assessment, exploitation, and attack to operating and defending Air Force networks.⁵⁸ In 2007, demonstrating another step in the Air Force's move to develop an organizational structure for fighting in cyberspace, the Air Force announced it would be officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command.⁵⁹ This plan, however, was altered slightly in 2008 when the Air Force announced that, instead of creating a new major command, it would be standing up a component numbered air force that would focus on cyberspace warfighting operations.⁶⁰\n⁵³ Kevin B.

Training\nThe Air Force has also implemented new training in the realm of cyber warfare operations. All Airmen, officer and enlisted, will be taught about cyber warfare in their initial accession training.⁶¹ In addition, approximately 100 students per year will receive more advanced instruction at the Undergraduate Network Warfare Training course, where graduates of the six-month program will be able to operate a computer like a weapon system.⁶²\n## B. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in other States\nA number of states are also incorporating cyber warfare as a new part of their military doctrine. This section will briefly examine cyber warfare operations in China, Russia, and North Korea.\n### 1. Development in China\nChina currently possesses a significant cyber weapons and intelligence infrastructure, and their cyber warfare doctrine is designed to achieve global “electronic dominance” by 2050. This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies.⁶³ In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.”⁶⁴ According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others.⁶⁵ A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks.⁶⁶ A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers.⁶⁷ In 2005, the PLA began to\n---\n⁶¹ Brook, supra note 57.\n⁶² Id.\n⁶³ Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁶⁴ Alexander, supra note 53.\n⁶⁵ Coleman, supra note 63.\n⁶⁶ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia\nRussia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine,⁶⁹ with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention.⁷⁰ Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force.⁷¹ Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.⁷²\n## 3. Development in North Korea\nIn 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception.⁷³ North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb⁷⁴—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.⁷⁵\nCyber Warfare Operations 133\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IV. WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nIn the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state.⁷⁶ It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place.⁷⁷ This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack\nA DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁷⁸ It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service.⁷⁹ One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.⁸⁰\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system.⁸¹ DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations.⁸² In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W. Williamson III wrote:\nAmerica needs a network that can project power by building an af.mil robot network (botnet) that can direct\n---\n⁷⁶ Coleman, supra note 27.\n⁷⁷ Id.\n⁷⁸ TechWeb.Com, Technocyclopedia, Denial of Service Attack, http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=denialofserviceattack (last visited Sept. 1, 2009).\n⁷⁹ CERT Coordination Center, Denial of Service Attacks, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Nono, Botnets fight back with Denial of service attacks!!, PC1NEWS.COM, Sep 12, 2008, http://www.pc1news.com/news/0221/botnets-fight-back-with-denial-of-service-attacks-.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n⁸² Kevin Coleman, Department of Cyber Defense, An organization who’s time has come!, TECHNOLOGY, Nov. 2007, at 2, available at http://www.technolytics.com/Dept_of_Cyber_Defense.pdf.\nsuch massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic. America needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack.⁸³\nA Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.⁸⁴\n## B. Malicious Programs\nMalicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer.⁸⁵ An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers.⁸⁶ The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software.⁸⁷ Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable.⁸⁸ Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.⁸⁹\nA virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another.⁹⁰ The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself.⁹¹ In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload.⁹² Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data\n⁸³ Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98\nA Trojan horse is \"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103\nA blended threat is \"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nvulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack, which means they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage.¹⁰⁵\nPolymorphic malware is “malicious software that has the ability to change its signature randomly each time it replicates.”¹⁰⁶ This technique is used to avoid detection by anti-spyware programs designed to recognize malware by its signature.¹⁰⁷ With polymorphic malware, only the appearance of the code is altered, not the function.¹⁰⁸\n## C. Logic Bomb\nA logic bomb is malicious code designed to execute if specific events occur or at a predetermined time.¹⁰⁹ Once triggered, it can take down the computer, delete data, or activate a DoS attack by generating bogus transactions.¹¹⁰\n## D. IP Spoofing\nIP spoofing, also known as IP address forgery or a host file hijack, is a hijacking technique in which hijackers masquerade as a trusted host to conceal their identity, spoof a Website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network.¹¹¹ When IP spoofing is used to hijack a browser, a visitor who types in the uniform resource locator (URL) of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent web page created by the hijacker. If the user interacts with dynamic content on a spoofed page, the hijacker can gain access to sensitive information or computer or network resources.¹¹²\n## E. Digital Manipulation\nDigital image manipulation is the alteration of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, which often reflects new meaning. This technique involves already existing imagery, such as photographs or videos.¹¹³\nCyber Warfare Operations\n137\nDoctoring photographs has been around as long as photography itself.¹¹⁴ In the intelligence and security communities one of the purposes of photo alteration is to misinform or deceive.¹¹⁵ As digital photo manipulation software increases in technical sophistication and people become more adept at using the software, the task of detecting manipulated images has become very challenging and digital photographic manipulation is now so sophisticated that it is sometimes impossible to discern whether people or objects in a photograph were actually there when the photo was taken.¹¹⁶ In 2006, it was uncovered that the media engaged in photo manipulation during the conflict between Israel and the Lebanese Hizbullah group.¹¹⁷ It is quite conceivable that a state could easily engage in photo manipulation, perhaps even changing images displayed on the internet by other states.\nIt is now possible to manipulate video in real time. In the fraction of a second between video frames, any person or object moving in the foreground can be edited out, and objects that aren't there can be edited in and made to look real.¹¹⁸ This fluidity stems from the changeable nature of the pixels that make up modern video.¹¹⁹ It is now possible to insert sets of pixels into satellite imagery data that interpreters would view as battalions of tanks or war planes.¹²⁰ Princeton Video Imaging (PVI) bolstered this point in a demo tape set in a suburban parking lot. The scene appeared ordinary except for amidst the SUVs and minivans are several parked tanks and one armored behemoth rolling incongruously along.¹²¹ Deleting people or objects from live video, or inserting prerecorded people or objects into live scenes, is only the beginning. The video manipulators can make previously recorded speakers say and do things they never actually said or did. In addition, modern technology compresses what used to take an hour into a sixtieth of a second, which permits real-time manipulation as a camera records or broadcasts.¹²²\nThe combination of real-time, virtual insertion with existing and emerging post-production techniques opens up a world of manipulative\n¹¹⁴ See, e.g., HANY FARID, PHOTO TAMPERING THROUGHOUT HISTORY, http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁵ See Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security, Photo Alteration, http://www.espionageinfo.com/Pa-Po/Photo-Alteration.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ See Yaakov Lappin, Reuters Admits to More Image Manipulation, YNETNEWS.COM, Aug. 7, 2006, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287774,00.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁸ Ivan Amato, Lying With Pixels, Seeing is No Longer believing, TECH.

Additionally, states could create completely fabricated real time webcasts showing their adversaries doing whatever they deem appropriate for their purposes. James Currie, a professor of political science at the National Defense University, who also has experience as a staffer with TOP SECRET clearance on the Senate’s Intelligence Committee and as a legislative liaison for the Secretary of the Army, is convinced that the military and intelligence communities will, or already do, possess real-time video manipulation capabilities.¹²⁴ Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators considered creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or getting caught in a sexually compromising situation and then distributing the tapes in Iraq and the Arab world.¹²⁵\nVoice morphing enables the cloning of speech patterns and creation of an accurate copy of a person's voice, which can then say anything the operator wishes it to say, appearing to be the voice of someone else.¹²⁶ George Papcun of the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed this technology.¹²⁷ The Washington Post detailed how Mr. Papcun could, in near real time, clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile by using just a 10-minute digital recording.¹²⁸\n## V. CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO ESPIONAGE\nA large amount of the cyber operations performed by a military will involve the collection of data or intelligence stored on another state’s network or analyzing the configuration of the network. These types of actions, provided they do not disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, should not be considered cyber warfare operations. The international community should view such activities as a form of espionage or cyber espionage. Espionage is the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting,\n¹²³ Id.\n¹²⁴ Id.\n¹²⁵ William M.

These two incidents demonstrate how espionage in the computer age has changed. Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information.¹³⁹ According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities.¹⁴⁰ In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks.¹⁴¹ Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is . . . They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.”¹⁴² Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”¹⁴³\nTitan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003.¹⁴⁴ The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain.¹⁴⁵ The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military.¹⁴⁶ The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation\n¹³⁷ Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n¹³⁸ Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE\nThe maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations.¹⁴⁸ The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter.¹⁴⁹ Article 2(3) of the U.N.

Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹⁵¹ Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states:\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council . . . .¹⁵²\nIn *Nicaragua v. United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law.¹⁵³ However, exactly what kinds of action constitute a use of force or armed attack is debatable, as the U.N. Charter does not define either phrase.\nA good place to look at what may constitute a use of force or an armed attack is the General Assembly’s resolution defining\n¹⁴⁷ Tom Espiner, *Security experts Lift Lid on Chinese hack attacks*, ZDNET.COM, Nov. 23, 2005, http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-145763.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹⁴⁸ SEAN D.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.”¹⁵⁵ Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union.¹⁵⁶ The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.¹⁵⁷ If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law.¹⁵⁸ However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n¹⁵⁴ Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 143\nIn April 2007, important websites in Estonia, including the website of the president, parliament, ministries, political parties, major news outlets, and Estonia’s two dominant banks, were hit by a series of DoS attacks.¹⁵⁹ These attacks continued until mid-June.¹⁶⁰ A Defense Ministry spokesman said sites that usually received 1,000 visits a day were buried under as many as 2,000 a second.¹⁶¹ Officials in Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks and security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian servers, including domains registered to the government and to the administration of then President Putin.¹⁶² The Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia’s complaints as fabrications.¹⁶³ Estonia reported the attacks to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).¹⁶⁴\nThe NATO Treaty, which Estonia and most EU Member States are a party to, provides that an attack on one of its members shall be considered an attack against all and enables party nations to exercise the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.¹⁶⁵ Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo called the attacks a national security situation and compared the situation to the shutdown of sea ports.¹⁶⁶ This comparison is interesting as Article 3(c) of the General Assembly’s resolution defining aggression lists “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State” as an act of aggression.¹⁶⁷ However, it should be noted that Article 41 of the U.N. Charter cites “complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”¹⁶⁸ After discussing the situation with NATO officials, Mr. Aaviksoo stated, “at present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition.¹⁷⁹ The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services.¹⁸⁰ However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism.¹⁸¹ The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either.¹⁸² Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state.¹⁸³ This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”¹⁸⁴\nWhat level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force. But what about the interfering with, or disruption of, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, and nuclear power plant safety systems?

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down.¹⁸⁵ The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke.¹⁸⁶ While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States.¹⁸⁷ Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities.¹⁸⁸ Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet.¹⁸⁹ These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands.¹⁹⁰ This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51,¹⁹¹ and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, has argued that an action can be defined as an armed attack if that action is intended to cause injury, death,\n¹⁸⁵ Ted Bridis &amp; Eileen Sullivan, *US Video Shows Hacker Hit on Power Grid*, SFGATE.COM (SAN.

This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case.¹⁹³ This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it.¹⁹⁴ In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law”¹⁹⁵ and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.”¹⁹⁶ Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR\nCyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare.¹⁹⁷ Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n### A. General Principles of the Law of War\n#### 1. Military Necessity\nThe principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible.¹⁹⁸ U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863.¹⁹⁹ Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect\n¹⁹⁷ Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n¹⁹⁸ See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n¹⁹⁹ Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1, 6 (2005).\nCyber Warfare Operations 149\ncustomary international law.²⁰⁰ It states that a military attack is lawful only against “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”²⁰¹\n## 2. Distinction\nAccording to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁰² Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”²⁰³ and also “the civilian population . . . as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.”²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁰⁵\n## 3. Proportionality\nThe principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective.²⁰⁶ Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage\n²⁰⁰ Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum. Law, Cambridge, Jan. 27-29, 2003), available at http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/pdfs/Session1.pdf.\n²⁰¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 52(2), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n²⁰² Sassòli, supra note 200, at 1. Additional Protocol I, Article 48, states this basic rule as, “the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Additional Protocol I, art. 48.\n²⁰³ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 13(1), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609, [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II, art. 13(2).\n²⁰⁵ Id. art. 13(3).\n²⁰⁶ Rod Powers, Law of Armed Conflict, ABOUT.COM: US MILITARY, at 2, http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n150 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\ngained. The law of war requires one to weigh the expected collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by the operation. The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”²⁰⁷ shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,”²⁰⁸ (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,”²⁰⁹ and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.”²¹⁰ Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.²¹¹\n## 4. Unnecessary Suffering\nHague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.”²¹² Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.”²¹³ This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n## 5. Perfidy\nTreacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other.²¹⁴ Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.²¹⁵\nCyber Warfare Operations 151\nPerfidy involves injuring the enemy by using his adherence to the law of war against him. Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1), also states, “it is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy”²¹⁶ and “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.”²¹⁷ Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare*, provides:\nThe line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct, but the following examples indicate the correct principles. It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.²¹⁸\nBecause cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy. Such misinformation is synonymous with any other method for delivering misinformation.²¹⁹\n## 6. Neutrality\nNeutrality is an essential tenet of international law.²²⁰ Neutrality affords states the right to maintain relations with all belligerents.²²¹ States that declare themselves neutral, and behave\n²¹⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 37(1).\n²¹⁷ *Id.* The following examples are provided: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status, and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.\n²¹⁸ FM 27-10, *supra* note 198, ¶ 50.\n²¹⁹ See Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n²²⁰ *Korns* &amp; *Kastenberg*, *supra* note 12, at 73.\n²²¹ *Id.* at 62.\n152 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\naccordingly, are entitled to immunity from attack.²²² Under the principle of neutrality a neutral state’s territory is to be secure from assault or trespass.²²³ Also, belligerents are forbidden from moving troops, munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral state.²²⁴ However, should the neutral state fail for any reason to prevent violations of its neutrality by the troops of one belligerent entering or passing through its territory, the other belligerent may be justified in attacking the enemy forces on this territory.²²⁵ Authors in the cyber law arena have suggested that in order to remain neutral in a cyber conflict a state cannot originate a cyber attack, and it also has to take action to prevent a cyber attack from transiting its internet nodes.²²⁶\nNeutrality becomes problematic for cyber warfare operations because the weapons of cyber warfare, such as requests being sent by computer systems from which DoS attacks originate or the malicious code that travels along networks, cannot always be predicted. For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another.²²⁷ Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.²²⁸\n## B. Targeting\nMilitary objectives are legitimate targets. Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage.”²²⁹ Objects which, by their nature, make an effective contribution to military action would include objects directly used by the armed force, such as: weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots, buildings occupied by armed forces, staff\n²²² Id.\n²²³ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 26 Stat. 2310, U.S.T. 540 (which states “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable”) [hereinafter Hague Convention V].\n²²⁴ Id. art. 2.\n²²⁵ FM 27-10 supra note 198, ¶ 520.\n²²⁶ Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 12, at 62; Jeffrey T.G.

Targeting People\nPeople can be divided into two categories: combatants and non-combatants. Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains.²³⁶ These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities.²³⁷ Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.”²³⁸ Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.”²³⁹ Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.²⁴⁰\n²³⁰ Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n²³¹ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n²³² Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n²³³ Id.\n²³⁴ Id.\n²³⁵ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n²³⁶ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n²³⁷ Id.\n²³⁸ Id. art. 43(1).\n²³⁹ Id. art. 44(3).\n²⁴⁰ Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III]. These requirements include “being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;”\n154 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nUnlike combatants, the law of war prohibits direct attacks on non-combatants. Non-combatants may be divided into two groups: civilians and enemy personnel out of combat. A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities.²⁴¹ The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.²⁴² Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited.²⁴³ Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁴⁴ The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n## 2. Targeting Places\nHague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended.²⁴⁵ Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack . . .”²⁴⁶ Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.”²⁴⁷ Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁴⁸ This\nwear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.*\n²⁴¹ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n²⁴² *Id.* art. 51(2).\n²⁴³ *Id.*\n²⁴⁴ *Id.* art. 51(3).\n²⁴⁵ Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n²⁴⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n²⁴⁷ *Id.* art. 52(3).\n²⁴⁸ *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and\nCyber Warfare Operations 155\nprotection terminates, however, if the enemy is using them in specific ways to support its war effort.²⁴⁹\nMoreover, “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁵⁰ It needs to be noted that the U.S. has not ratified Additional Protocol I and specifically objects, for military reasons, to Article 56.²⁵¹ The objection is that this Article disregards the longstanding principle of proportionality and prohibits the attack if there are to be “severe” civilian losses, no matter how important the target may be from a military point of view.²⁵²\n## 3. Dual-Use Targets\nDual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers.²⁵³ Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.²⁵⁴\nAs previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker.²⁵⁵ The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military\ndirect support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n²⁴⁹ Id.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 56(1).\n²⁵¹ See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows:\nDual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257\nThe international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n256 Id. art. 51(5)(b).\n257 Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper, International Humanitarian Law Issues In A Potential War In Iraq (2003), available at http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/iraq0202003.htm#5.\n258 Eritrea Ethiopia Claims Commission, Partial Award, Western Front, Aerial Bombardment and Related Claims, Eritrea’s Claims 1, 3, 5, 9-13, 14, 21, 25 &amp; 26 33 (Dec. 19, 2005), available at http://www.pca-cpa.org/upload/files/FINAL%20ER%20FRONT%20CLAIMS.pdf.\n259 Id. at 35.\n260 Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 157\nC. Analysis\nCyber warfare operations have the capability of being a very effective option during an armed conflict. Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters.²⁶¹ However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system.²⁶² Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.”²⁶³ This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared\n²⁶¹ Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n²⁶² Id.\n²⁶³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n158 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nto a conventional attack intended to accomplish the same results, and would therefore be lawful.\nA more difficult example to analyze is the altering of electronic maintenance manuals of an adversary’s aircraft stored on a network. While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks.²⁶⁴ Deleting military files, or even the\n²⁶⁴ A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. See Webopedia.com, network, http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/n/network.html (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\nCyber Warfare Operations 159\nannihilation of military computer networks, would constitute a proper military objective. These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted, \"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"²⁶⁵\n## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS\nThe law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility.²⁶⁶ This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law.²⁶⁷ The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act.²⁶⁸ Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations. This section will examine a few areas states should consider when developing plans for cyber warfare operations.\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nA. International Outer Space Law\nThe Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was created by the U.N. in 1959.²⁶⁹ The purpose of COPUOS is to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise U.N. programs in this field, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space.²⁷⁰ COPUOS is the only international forum for the development of international space law. Since its inception, the Committee concluded five international legal instruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities.²⁷¹ The five international treaties are: the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty),²⁷² the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement),²⁷³ the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention),²⁷⁴ the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention),²⁷⁵ and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Moon Treaty).²⁷⁶ The Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention both include language that may impact cyber warfare operations.\n²⁶⁹ G.A.

Outer Space Treaty\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space.²⁷⁷ While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military.²⁷⁸ However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful.²⁷⁹ The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere.²⁸⁰ Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.²⁸¹\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .”²⁸² The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state.²⁸³ Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.²⁸⁴\n²⁷⁷ UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n²⁷⁸ See Major Robert A. Ramey, *Armed Conflict on the Final Frontier: The Law of War in Space*, 48 A.F. L. REV. 1, 79 (2000).\n²⁷⁹ Id.\n²⁸⁰ Id.\n²⁸¹ Id.\n²⁸² Id. at 77; Outer Space Treaty, supra note 272, art. IX.\n²⁸³ Id.\n²⁸⁴ Id.\nSpace assets also create dual-use issues, specifically regarding commercial assets. For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes.²⁸⁵ Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military.²⁸⁶ As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.²⁸⁷ On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military.²⁸⁸ A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.²⁸⁹\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n## 2. Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.²⁹⁰ In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n²⁸⁵ *Id.* at 148-149.\n²⁸⁶ Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F. L. REV. 157, 200 (2004) (citing Katie McConnell, *Military Satellite Communications: The March Toward Commercialization*, DEFENSE DAILY (2003)).\n²⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 51(5)(b).\n²⁸⁸ *Ramey*, *supra* note 278, at 150.\n²⁸⁹ *Id.*\n²⁹⁰ *Liability Convention*, *supra* note 274, art. II.\nCyber Warfare Operations 163\nis the state’s fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.²⁹¹ The Convention provides exoneration from absolute liability to the extent that a launching state establishes the damage resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant state.²⁹² However, no exoneration will be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching state which are not in conformity with international law.²⁹³\nTherefore, a state conducting cyber warfare operations against another state’s satellite may be liable to the launching state for the damage done to the satellite and by the satellite, as a result of operations against it. For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.²⁹⁴\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.²⁹⁵\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)²⁹⁶ and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC)²⁹⁷ as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations. For example, Article 35 of the ITC prohibits harmful interference with the radio spectrum.\nAll stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognized\n²⁹¹ *Id.* art.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency responsible for promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunication.\n²⁹⁷ International Telecommunications Convention, Nairobi, Nov. 6, 1982, 32 U.S.T. 3821 [hereinafter ITU Convention].\n164 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nprivate operating agencies, or of other duly authorized operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.²⁹⁸\nHarmful interference is defined as “interference which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations.”²⁹⁹\nArticle 37 of the ITC may also impact cyber warfare operations. It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country.³⁰⁰ Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency³⁰¹ and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.³⁰²\nArticle 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.”³⁰³ This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used . . .”³⁰⁴ Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services.³⁰⁵ An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals.³⁰⁶ This prohibition does not\n²⁹⁸ Id. art. 35\n²⁹⁹ Id. annex 2.\n³⁰⁰ Id. art. 37.\n³⁰¹ Id. art. 19(2).\n³⁰² Id. art. 20.\n³⁰³ Id. art. 38(1).\n³⁰⁴ Id. art. 38(2).\n³⁰⁵ Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n³⁰⁶ See LAWRENCE T.

Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency. As a result, while a state may, under certain circumstances, block or suspend international communications, it may not lawfully spoof communications. However, there is ample precedent that provisions of international communication conventions are suspended between belligerents engaged in armed conflicts.³⁰⁸\n## C. International Aviation Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of, or interference with, civilian aviation may implicate numerous international aviation laws. Such operations may involve disrupting an air traffic control tower, modifying a flight’s passenger list, or adding a name to a no-fly list. These types of operations have the potential to result in a delay or cancellation of flights, thereby interrupting travel plans of targeted belligerents.\n## 1. The Convention on International Civil Aviation\nThe primary international law governing aviation is the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention.³⁰⁹ This Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft\n³⁰⁷ *Id.*\n³⁰⁸ See Dep’t of Defense General Counsel, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* 33 (May 1999), available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf.\n³⁰⁹ Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, Dec. 7, 1944, 15 U.N.T.S. 295, [hereinafter Chicago Convention].\n166 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nregistration, and safety.³¹⁰ The Convention is supported by eighteen annexes containing standards and recommended practices; these annexes are amended regularly by ICAO.³¹¹ Annex 17 sets out the basis for the ICAO civil aviation security program and seeks to safeguard civil aviation and its facilities against acts of unlawful interference.³¹² This Annex requires that each member state “have as its primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public in all matters related to safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation.”³¹³\nA 1998 amendment to the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircraft.³¹⁴ Article 3 bis(a) specifically states that “the contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight . . .”³¹⁵ Article 89 of the Chicago Convention allows a contracting state to disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency.\n[I]n case of war, the provisions of this Convention shall not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States affected, whether as belligerents or as neutrals. The same principle shall apply in the case of any contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies the fact to the Council.³¹⁶\nCyber warfare operations targeting civilian aviation may run afoul of a state’s obligation under the Chicago Convention to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Additionally, if a cyber warfare operation targets an aircraft in flight, the operation very well may be a violation of the Article 3bis requirement to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight. However,\n³¹⁰ Wikipedia.org, Convention on International Civil Aviation, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n³¹¹ Id.\n³¹² See International Civil Aviation Organization, ANNEXES TO THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION Annex 17, available at http://www.icao.int/eshop/pub/anx_info/an17_info_en.pdf.\n³¹³ Paul Stephen Dempsey, Aviation Security: The Role of Law in the War Against Terrorism, 41 COLUM.

This national emergency exception may provide some latitude in conducting cyber warfare operations in situations short of war.\n## 2. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation\nThe Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention of 1971, makes specific conduct unlawful.³¹⁷ Article 1 provides that a person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally does or attempts to do any of the following:\n performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft;³¹⁸  destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;³¹⁹  places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;³²⁰  destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight;³²¹ or,  communicates information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.³²²\nThis Convention may limit the ability to conduct cyber warfare operations that interfere with an aircraft’s operating system, if such an operation would render the aircraft incapable of flight. Additionally, this Convention may also place a prohibition on interfering with the networks of air navigation facilities, as it essentially prohibits the ability to disrupt air traffic control communications or other aspects of air\n³¹⁷ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 564 [hereinafter Montreal Convention].\n³¹⁸ Id. art. 1(1)(a).\n³¹⁹ Id. art. 1(1)(b).\n³²⁰ Id. art. 1(1)(c).\n³²¹ Id. art. 1(1)(d).\n³²² Id. art. 1(1)(e).\n168 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64\nnavigation, if it interferes with their operation and endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight. Finally, this Convention may prohibit cyber warfare operations from spoofing communication if it would endanger the safety of an aircraft. However, nothing in this Convention appears to limit cyber warfare operations that do not render a flight unable to fly or endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight.\n## 3. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation\nThe Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation³²³ supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death”³²⁴ or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.”³²⁵ This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n## D. Arms Control Treaties\nArms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification.³²⁶ For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in\n³²³ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n³²⁴ Id. art. II, para 1..\n³²⁵ Id.\n³²⁶ Wingfield, supra note 18, at 330.\nCyber Warfare Operations 169\naccordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\"³²⁷ This agreement also provided that “each Party undertakes not to use deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the provisions of this Interim Agreement.”³²⁸ This became standard language in arms control treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union as evidenced by the language in Article XV of the 1979 Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and Protocol Thereto (SALT II), which states that “paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are adopted verbatim from the first two paragraphs of Article XII of the ABM Treaty and Article V of the Interim Agreement.”³²⁹ The third paragraph of this Article prohibits deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the Treaty.³³⁰\nArms control treaties that place a prohibition on interfering with the national technical means of a state may limit the ability of both states to conduct cyber warfare operations against the intelligence collecting capabilities of the other. However, arms control treaties, like other treaties except those defining laws of war, are suspended during war between parties.³³¹ Therefore, cyber warfare operations that interfere with military reconnaissance satellites used for arms control verification may violate the treaty. However, during hostilities these satellites would become a proper military objective.\n## E. Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime\nThe Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks.³³² The main objective of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation.³³³ The U.S. ratified the Cybercrime\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\nConvention in 2006. $^{334}$ This Convention covers a broad range of criminal conduct broken up into four categories: offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems; $^{335}$ computer-related offenses; $^{336}$ content-related offenses; $^{337}$ and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. $^{338}$\nCyber Warfare Operations would most likely run afoul of the offenses described within the first category, in particular Articles 2 through 5, which relate to illegal access, illegal interception, data interference, and system interference, respectively. $^{339}$ However, its rules do not apply to government activities, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. $^{340}$ For example, Article 2 requires states to adopt “legislative and other measures” to establish as criminal offenses under their domestic law intentional “access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right.” $^{341}$ The accompanying Explanatory Report clarifies that the “without right” caveat “leaves unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority,” including acts to “protect national security or investigate criminal offences.” $^{342}$ Nevertheless, this Convention still poses potential problems for conducting cyber warfare operations. For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other . . . to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” $^{343}$ This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\nCyber Warfare Operations 171\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64\n# IX. CONCLUSION\nNothing in international law explicitly prohibits cyber warfare operations. However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports.³⁴⁴ Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.³⁴⁵\nDespite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology.³⁴⁶ The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry.³⁴⁷ In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons.³⁴⁸ In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place\n³⁴⁴ See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n³⁴⁵ Id. at 1032.\n³⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n³⁴⁷ Id.\n³⁴⁸ Id.\non the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers . . . .\"349 I contend that the future Mr. Kuryanovich discusses is now, and that now is the time for states to determine what is and is not permitted under international law in relation to cyber warfare operations. Failure to do so now may result in overly restrictive, reactionary regulations in response to a cyber Pearl Harbor-like attack, rather than a well thought out, proactive, structured approach.\nCyber Warfare Operations 173\n349 Brian Krebs, Lithuania Weathers Cyber Attack, Braces for Round 2, WASH.

INTRODUCTION In 2000, John Serabian, the Information Operations Issue Manager for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), noted the CIA was “detecting, with increasing frequency, the appearance of doctrine and dedicated offensive cyber warfare programs in other countries.”² He further asserted that the countries developing cyber programs “recognize the value of attacking adversary computer systems, both on the military and domestic front.”³ As of 2007, there were an estimated 120 countries working on cyber attack commands, and in 10 to 20 years experts believe we could see countries jostling for cyber supremacy.⁴ States are no doubt preparing to launch international all-out online attacks and the current political environment includes countries testing the waters to gauge the potential influence, and risks, of such assaults.⁵ The assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division stated that computer attacks pose the biggest risk “from a national security perspective, other than a weapon of mass destruction or a bomb on one of our major cities.”⁶ NATO’s Chief of Cyber Defense concurs, stating that “cyber terrorism [and] cyber attacks pose as great a threat to national security as a missile attack.”⁷ As states begin to focus their energies on developing doctrine and weapons for conducting cyber warfare operations, it is essential that we move beyond just the realization that cyberspace is an important new battleground for conducting warfare operations and recognize the need to come to an understanding of what rules regulate this new battlefield. One commentator noted: The rapid advancement of cyber attacks and the emergence of cyber warfare have caught government Cyber Warfare Operations 123 ¹ Randall Mikkelsen, U.S. Not Ready for Cyber Attack, REUTERS, Dec. 19, 2008, available at http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSTRE4BI00520081219 (quoting Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security).\n² John A.

Decision making in time requiring defensive measures or military crisis is guided by doctrine and rules of engagement, but in the case of cyber attacks and cyber warfare they do not currently exist.⁸ For over a century, states have developed rules of international law, such as the Geneva Conventions, which seek to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur.⁹ Additionally, as new technologies emerge, states have drafted new sets of laws, such as treaties restricting biological, chemical and laser weapons.¹⁰ Yet governments have so far resisted calls to craft new rules of international law to govern attacks on or by computers.¹¹ As a result, current international law does not explicitly address cyber warfare.¹² However, the fact that a particular military activity is not specifically regulated does not mean it can be used without restrictions.¹³ While the international community remains unsettled on whether cyber techniques are legally considered weapons and whether cyber attacks can be considered legitimate acts of armed conflict,¹⁴ the denial of service (DoS) attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 illustrate that this new form of warfare is operational and also reinforces the need to develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare. Without such an understanding, this emerging form of warfare will create uncertainties as to the legality of certain acts; this uncertainty has the potential to then escalate tensions and intensify military operations beyond the cyber domain. For example, more than one senior Russian military official supported the notion that “the use of Information Warfare against Russia or its armed forces will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict whether there were casualties or not”¹⁵ and that “Russia retains the right ⁸ Kevin Coleman, *Cyber Attacks &amp; Warfare – Rules of Engagement*, DEFENSETECH.org., Nov 28, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁹ Duncan B.

Section II reviews the definitions of key terms associated with cyber warfare operations. Section III examines the development of cyber warfare doctrine and organizational structure. Section IV will provide an overview of weapons associated with cyber warfare. Section V will examine cyber warfare operations in relation to espionage under international law. Section VI will examine cyber warfare operations and use of force. Section VII will analyze cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. Section VIII will examine other treaties and conventions relating to cyber warfare operations. Section IX will give brief concluding thoughts and recommendations.\n## II. DEFINING KEY TERMS To develop a better understanding of how international law relates to cyber warfare operations, one must begin by defining what is cyber warfare. However, in order to understand a definition of cyber warfare, it is necessary to first define cyberspace.\n## A. Cyberspace While there is no internationally accepted definition of\"cyberspace,\"numerous definitions exist. The Department of Defense defines\"cyberspace\"as\"[a] global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.\"¹⁷ Thomas Wingfield, in his book *The Law of Information Conflict: National Security Law in Cyberspace*, gives a more plain language definition.\"Cyberspace is not a physical place – it defies measurement in any physical dimension or time space continuum. It is a shorthand term that refers to the environment created by the confluence of cooperative networks of computers, information systems, and telecommunication infrastructures commonly referred to as the Cyber Warfare Operations 125 World Wide Web.”¹⁸ A 2001 Congressional Research Service (CRS) Report for Congress defined “cyberspace” as the “total interconnectedness of human beings through computers and telecommunication without regard to physical geography.”¹⁹ These multiple definitions of “cyberspace” illustrate the difficulty in defining the term, which may be one of the difficulties in creating any type of common agreement among states as to how international law should be applied to warfare conducted in cyberspace. I would propose that for the purpose of analyzing military operations in cyberspace, one should start by focusing primarily on computer networks. Therefore, for purposes of this article, I will utilize the definition of cyberspace proposed by the National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations: “A domain characterized by the use of [computers and other electronic devices] to store, modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures.”²⁰ ## B. Cyber Warfare As with the term “cyberspace,” there is no widely accepted definition of “cyber warfare.” The Department of Defense defines “cyber operations” as “the employment of cyber capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives or effects in or through cyberspace.”²¹ The Department of Defense defines the phrase “computer network attack” as “actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves.”²² Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 uses the term “network warfare operations” to define “the integrated planning and employment of military capabilities to achieve desired effects across the interconnected analog and digital portion of the battlespace.”²³ This Policy Directive uses the term “network attack” to define “the employment of network-based capabilities to destroy, disrupt, corrupt, Air Force Law Review • Volume 64 or usurp information resident in or transiting through networks.”²⁴ A 2001 CRS Report for Congress, notes that “[c]yberwarfare can be used to describe various aspects of defending and attacking information and computer networks in cyberspace, as well as denying an adversary’s ability to do the same.”²⁵ A 2006 CRS Report for Congress defined the phrase “computer network attack” as “operations to disrupt or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks.”²⁶ Kevin Coleman, a Senior Fellow and Strategic Management Consultant at the Technolytics Institute, an independent executive think tank, defined “cyber war” as “a conflict that uses hostile, illegal transactions or attacks on computers and networks in an effort to disrupt communications and other pieces of infrastructure as a mechanism to inflict economic harm or upset defenses.”²⁷ These various definitions again illustrate the difficulty in defining what is meant by “cyber warfare.” Recognizing that military operations in cyberspace could be viewed as warfare, I propose the phrase “cyber warfare operations” be used in analyzing the wide range of military operations in cyberspace and suggest the following definition: “the use of network-based capabilities of one state to disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, of another state.”\n## III. DEVELOPMENT OF CYBER WARFARE DOCTRINE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE This section will examine the development of cyber warfare operations in the United States, in particular, the U.S. Air Force. It will focus on doctrine, organization, and training. It will then provide an overview of the development of cyber warfare operations in other states.\n## A. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in the United States The current state of planning for cyber warfare operations has been likened to the early years following the invention of the atomic Cyber Warfare Operations 127 bomb a half-century ago, when thinking about how to wage nuclear war lagged behind the ability to launch one.²⁸ Richard A. Clarke, a former special advisor to the President on cyber security, once stated, “we have capabilities, we have organizations; we do not yet have an elaborated strategy, doctrine, procedures.”²⁹ However, this is starting to change. The first step towards developing a cyber warfare strategy occurred in the summer of 2002, when the President signed National Security Presidential Directive 16, which called for a national policy on the rules of engagement for using cyber warfare as a weapon.³⁰ This Directive instructed “the government to prepare national-level guidance on U.S. policies for launching cyber attacks against enemies.”³¹ In February 2003, the White House published *The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace*, a document that presented cyber security as a subset of Homeland Security and contained, among its many initiatives, a call for the government “to improve coordination for responding to cyber attacks within the U.S. national security community.”³² This document also makes clear that the U.S. government reserves the right to respond “in an appropriate manner” if the United States comes under computer attack and that this response could involve the use of U.S. cyber weapons.³³ Also in 2003, the Department of Defense published the *Information Operations Roadmap*, in which the Secretary of Defense stated, “[t]he Roadmap stands as another example of the Department’s commitment to transform our military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.”³⁴ This publication notes that networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity, and that the Department must be prepared to “fight the net.”³⁵ One of the desired outcomes mentioned in this Roadmap is that forces ²⁸ Bradley Graham, *Bush Orders Guidelines for Cyber-Warfare*, WASH.

Doctrine Department of Defense Directive O-3600.1 assigns baseline responsibilities for the conduct of “information operations,” a term that includes electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security.³⁷ This Directive states the Department of Defense policy that information operations “shall be employed to support full spectrum dominance by taking advantage of information technology, maintaining U.S. strategic dominance in network technologies, and capitalizing upon near real-time global dissemination of information, to affect adversary decision cycles with the goal of achieving information superiority for the United States.”³⁸ It also provides that information operations capabilities “shall be developed that can be employed in concert with various core, supporting, related, and intelligence capabilities to provide a fully integrated warfighting capability.”³⁹ Joint Publication 3-13 provides doctrine for information operations planning, preparation, execution, and assessment in support of joint operations.⁴⁰ This publication comments that computer network operations “is one of the latest capabilities developed in support of military operations” and stems from the “increasing use of networked computers and supporting IT infrastructure systems by military and civilian organizations.”⁴¹ It also notes that computer network operations, along with electronic warfare, are used to attack, deceive, degrade, disrupt, deny, exploit, and defend electronic information and infrastructure.⁴² This publication further remarks that for the purpose of military operations, computer network operations are divided into three ³⁶ *Id.* at 49.\n³⁷ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF., DIR. 3600.1, INFORMATION OPERATIONS (14 Aug. 2006), available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/360001p.pdf.\n³⁸ *Id.* at 2.\n³⁹ *Id.* ⁴⁰ JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, JOINT PUBLICATION 3-13, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, at i (13 Feb. 2006) [hereinafter Joint Pub 3-13], available at http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp3_13.pdf.\n⁴¹ *Id.* at II-4 ⁴² *Id.* at II-4-II-5.\nCyber Warfare Operations 129 categories: computer network attack, computer network defense, and related computer network exploitation enabling operations.⁴³ Finally, Air Force Policy Directive 10-7 provides guidance for planning and conducting Air Force information operations to support the warfighter and achieve national strategy objectives.⁴⁴ This Directive states that Air Force information operations consist of the integrated application of electronic warfare operations, network warfare operations, and influence operations.⁴⁵ It also notes that network operations are comprised of network attack, network defense, and network warfare support.⁴⁶ ## 2. Organization The U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) is one of 10 unified commands under the Department of Defense. Part of USSTRATCOM’s mission is to ensure freedom of action in cyberspace and to deliver integrated kinetic and non-kinetic effects, including information operations, in support of Joint Force Commander operations.⁴⁷ USSTRATCOM helps plan and coordinate offensive computer operations across military and defense agencies through what it calls the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC-NW).⁴⁸ JFCC-NW plans and, when directed, executes operations in and through cyberspace, assuring U.S. and allied forces freedom of action, denying adversaries’ freedom of action, and enabling effects beyond the cyber domain.⁴⁹ One of the key roles for the JFCC-NW is to foster new lines of communication for network warfare-related activities, bringing together the various organizations within the military that work in this area.⁵⁰ Additional key tasks for JFCC-NW are to develop standard procedures and doctrine for network warfare activities⁵¹ and ensure that U.S. forces have the tools they need to wage network warfare today and in the future.⁵² In March 2005, the National Defense Strategy identified cyberspace as a new theater of operations.⁵³ Also in 2005, the Air Force mission statement expanded to reflect that cyberspace was now an official Air Force domain: “to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace.”⁵⁴ In 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force announced the 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace.⁵⁵ Also in 2006, the Air Force stood up the 67th Network Warfare Wing.⁵⁶ “The Air Force established the 67th Network Warfare Wing to have an organization solely focused on ensuring that our networks are able to operate in time of peace and war and to have the capability to deal with potential adversaries who may be trying to exploit our networks.”⁵⁷ The 67th Network Warfare Wing provides full spectrum network operations from the offensive capabilities of assessment, exploitation, and attack to operating and defending Air Force networks.⁵⁸ In 2007, demonstrating another step in the Air Force's move to develop an organizational structure for fighting in cyberspace, the Air Force announced it would be officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command.⁵⁹ This plan, however, was altered slightly in 2008 when the Air Force announced that, instead of creating a new major command, it would be standing up a component numbered air force that would focus on cyberspace warfighting operations.⁶⁰ ⁵³ Kevin B.

Training The Air Force has also implemented new training in the realm of cyber warfare operations. All Airmen, officer and enlisted, will be taught about cyber warfare in their initial accession training.⁶¹ In addition, approximately 100 students per year will receive more advanced instruction at the Undergraduate Network Warfare Training course, where graduates of the six-month program will be able to operate a computer like a weapon system.⁶² ## B. Development of Cyber Warfare Operations in other States A number of states are also incorporating cyber warfare as a new part of their military doctrine. This section will briefly examine cyber warfare operations in China, Russia, and North Korea.\n### 1. Development in China China currently possesses a significant cyber weapons and intelligence infrastructure, and their cyber warfare doctrine is designed to achieve global “electronic dominance” by 2050. This includes the capability of disrupting the information infrastructure of their enemies.⁶³ In 1999, the PLA Daily, the official media outlet for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the People’s Republic of China, stated, “Internet warfare is of equal significance to land, sea, and air power and requires its own military branch.”⁶⁴ According to military and intelligence sources, Chinese cyber forces have developed detailed plans for cyber attacks against the United States and others.⁶⁵ A 2007 Department of Defense report indicated the PLA had established information warfare units to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and tactics and measures to protect friendly computer systems and networks.⁶⁶ A CRS Report for Congress noted that China was pursuing the concept of a Net Force, which would consist of a strong reserve force of computer experts trained at a number of universities and training centers.⁶⁷ In 2005, the PLA began to --- ⁶¹ Brook, supra note 57.\n⁶² Id.\n⁶³ Kevin Coleman, *China’s Cyber Forces*, DEFENSETECH.ORG., May 8, 2008, available at http://www.defensetech.org/archives/cat_cyberwarfare.html.\n⁶⁴ Alexander, supra note 53.\n⁶⁵ Coleman, supra note 63.\n⁶⁶ U.S. DEP’T OF DEF.

Development in Russia Russia’s armed forces, collaborating with experts in the information technology sector and academia, have developed a robust cyber warfare doctrine,⁶⁹ with offensive cyber weapons receiving significant attention.⁷⁰ Russia's cyber warfare doctrine is designed to act as a force multiplier, which is a military term that describes a weapon or tactic that, when added to and employed along with other combat forces, significantly increases the combat potential of that force.⁷¹ Like all offensive cyber strategies, Russia’s includes the capability to disrupt the information infrastructure of their enemies and includes strategies that would disrupt financial markets and military and civilian communications capabilities as well as other parts of the enemy's critical infrastructure prior to the initiation of traditional military operations.⁷² ## 3. Development in North Korea In 1998, the North Korean military created Unit 121, which focuses solely on cyber warfare and has steadily grown in size and capability since its inception.⁷³ North Korea possesses the technical capability to construct and deploy an array of cyber weapons and in October 2007 tested its first logic bomb⁷⁴—one of the weapons of cyber warfare operations defined below. This test led to a U.N. Security Council resolution banning sales of mainframe computers and laptop PCs to North Korea. However, the U.N. response failed to deter the North Korean military from continuing their cyber weapons development program.⁷⁵ Cyber Warfare Operations 133 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64 # IV. WEAPONS OF CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS In the mid 1990s, a study by the RAND Corporation found the costs of developing the cyber weapons needed for conducting cyber warfare to be extremely modest and within financial reach for nearly every state.⁷⁶ It is now estimated that about 140 nations have active operational cyber weapons development programs in place.⁷⁷ This section provides an overview of different cyber weapons a state could use to engage in cyber warfare.\n## A. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack A DoS attack is “an assault on a network that floods it with so many additional requests that regular traffic is either slowed or completely interrupted.”⁷⁸ It is characterized by an explicit attempt to prevent legitimate users of a service from using that service.⁷⁹ One of the advantages of this type of attack is that it can be executed with limited resources against a larger and more sophisticated computer or network. For example, an attacker with an old PC and a slow modem may be able to disable much faster and more sophisticated machines or networks.⁸⁰ A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one in which a mass of infected computers or systems attacks an individual system. When conducting a DDoS attack, an aggressor utilizes thousands of infected computers—known as zombies or bots—to concurrently attack a single system.⁸¹ DDoS attacks are difficult to stop because the data flooding the system originates from multiple computers and multiple locations.⁸² In the May 2008 issue of Armed Forces Journal, Colonel Charles W. Williamson III wrote: America needs a network that can project power by building an af.mil robot network (botnet) that can direct --- ⁷⁶ Coleman, supra note 27.\n⁷⁷ Id.\n⁷⁸ TechWeb.Com, Technocyclopedia, Denial of Service Attack, http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=denialofserviceattack (last visited Sept. 1, 2009).\n⁷⁹ CERT Coordination Center, Denial of Service Attacks, http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/denial_of_service.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n⁸⁰ Id.\n⁸¹ Nono, Botnets fight back with Denial of service attacks!!, PC1NEWS.COM, Sep 12, 2008, http://www.pc1news.com/news/0221/botnets-fight-back-with-denial-of-service-attacks-.html (last visited Sept. 8, 2009).\n⁸² Kevin Coleman, Department of Cyber Defense, An organization who’s time has come!, TECHNOLOGY, Nov. 2007, at 2, available at http://www.technolytics.com/Dept_of_Cyber_Defense.pdf.\nsuch massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic. America needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack.⁸³ A Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) attack damages a system so badly that it requires replacement or reinstallation of hardware. Unlike a DDoS attack, which is used to sabotage a service or Website, or as a cover for malware delivery, a PDoS is pure hardware sabotage.⁸⁴ ## B. Malicious Programs Malicious programs attack by disrupting normal computer functions, or by opening a back door for a remote attacker to take control of the computer.⁸⁵ An attack can either immediately disable a computer or incorporate a time delay, after which a remote command will direct the infected computer to transmit harmful signals that disrupt other computers.⁸⁶ The technologically savvy often refer to malicious programs as malware, short for malicious software.⁸⁷ Malware may delete files or otherwise make them unusable.⁸⁸ Common examples of malware include viruses, worms and trojan horses.⁸⁹ A virus attaches itself to a program or file so it can spread from one computer to another.⁹⁰ The virus spreads across disks and networks by making copies of itself.⁹¹ In addition to self-replicating code, a virus normally contains a payload.⁹² Cyber attackers can program the payload to have malicious side effects such as data ⁸³ Charles W.

However, unlike a virus, a worm has the capability to travel without any help from a person. It does this by taking advantage of file or information transport features on a system, which allow it to travel unaided.95 The biggest danger with a worm is its capability to replicate itself on a system. Thus, rather than a computer's sending out a single worm, it could send out hundreds or thousands of copies of itself.96 Due to the copying nature of a worm and its capability to travel across networks, the end result in most cases is that the worm consumes too much system memory or network bandwidth, causing web servers, network servers, and individual computers to stop responding.97 Cyber aggressors designed recent worm attacks to tunnel into a computer system and allow malicious users to control the infected computer remotely.98 A Trojan horse is\"a program in which malicious or harmful code is contained inside apparently harmless programming or data in such a way that it can get control and do its chosen form of damage.\"99 Those who receive a Trojan horse usually fall prey to opening it because it appears to be legitimate software or files from a legitimate source.100 Trojan horses can cause serious damage by deleting files and destroying information on a system.101 Trojan horses can also create a back door on computers that gives malicious users access to the system, possibly allowing the compromise of confidential or personal information.102 Unlike viruses and worms, Trojan horses do not reproduce by infecting other files nor do they self-replicate.103 A blended threat is\"a sophisticated attack that bundles some of the worst aspects of viruses, worms, Trojan horses and malicious code into one threat.\"104 Blended threats use server and internet Air Force Law Review • Volume 64 vulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack, which means they can spread quickly and cause widespread damage.¹⁰⁵ Polymorphic malware is “malicious software that has the ability to change its signature randomly each time it replicates.”¹⁰⁶ This technique is used to avoid detection by anti-spyware programs designed to recognize malware by its signature.¹⁰⁷ With polymorphic malware, only the appearance of the code is altered, not the function.¹⁰⁸ ## C. Logic Bomb A logic bomb is malicious code designed to execute if specific events occur or at a predetermined time.¹⁰⁹ Once triggered, it can take down the computer, delete data, or activate a DoS attack by generating bogus transactions.¹¹⁰ ## D. IP Spoofing IP spoofing, also known as IP address forgery or a host file hijack, is a hijacking technique in which hijackers masquerade as a trusted host to conceal their identity, spoof a Website, hijack browsers, or gain access to a network.¹¹¹ When IP spoofing is used to hijack a browser, a visitor who types in the uniform resource locator (URL) of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent web page created by the hijacker. If the user interacts with dynamic content on a spoofed page, the hijacker can gain access to sensitive information or computer or network resources.¹¹² ## E. Digital Manipulation Digital image manipulation is the alteration of an image using computer program tools and software to produce a contrived image, which often reflects new meaning. This technique involves already existing imagery, such as photographs or videos.¹¹³ Cyber Warfare Operations It is now possible to manipulate video in real time. In the fraction of a second between video frames, any person or object moving in the foreground can be edited out, and objects that aren't there can be edited in and made to look real.¹¹⁸ This fluidity stems from the changeable nature of the pixels that make up modern video.¹¹⁹ It is now possible to insert sets of pixels into satellite imagery data that interpreters would view as battalions of tanks or war planes.¹²⁰ Princeton Video Imaging (PVI) bolstered this point in a demo tape set in a suburban parking lot. The scene appeared ordinary except for amidst the SUVs and minivans are several parked tanks and one armored behemoth rolling incongruously along.¹²¹ Deleting people or objects from live video, or inserting prerecorded people or objects into live scenes, is only the beginning. The video manipulators can make previously recorded speakers say and do things they never actually said or did. In addition, modern technology compresses what used to take an hour into a sixtieth of a second, which permits real-time manipulation as a camera records or broadcasts.¹²² The combination of real-time, virtual insertion with existing and emerging post-production techniques opens up a world of manipulative ¹¹⁴ See, e.g., HANY FARID, PHOTO TAMPERING THROUGHOUT HISTORY, http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/research/digitaltampering (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁵ See Espionage Information: Encyclopedia of Espionage, Intelligence, and Security, Photo Alteration, http://www.espionageinfo.com/Pa-Po/Photo-Alteration.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁶ Id.\n¹¹⁷ See Yaakov Lappin, Reuters Admits to More Image Manipulation, YNETNEWS.COM, Aug. 7, 2006, http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3287774,00.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹¹⁸ Ivan Amato, Lying With Pixels, Seeing is No Longer believing, TECH.

Additionally, states could create completely fabricated real time webcasts showing their adversaries doing whatever they deem appropriate for their purposes. James Currie, a professor of political science at the National Defense University, who also has experience as a staffer with TOP SECRET clearance on the Senate’s Intelligence Committee and as a legislative liaison for the Secretary of the Army, is convinced that the military and intelligence communities will, or already do, possess real-time video manipulation capabilities.¹²⁴ Pentagon planners started to discuss digital morphing after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Covert operators considered creating a computer-faked videotape of Saddam Hussein crying or getting caught in a sexually compromising situation and then distributing the tapes in Iraq and the Arab world.¹²⁵ Voice morphing enables the cloning of speech patterns and creation of an accurate copy of a person's voice, which can then say anything the operator wishes it to say, appearing to be the voice of someone else.¹²⁶ George Papcun of the Los Alamos National Laboratory developed this technology.¹²⁷ The Washington Post detailed how Mr. Papcun could, in near real time, clone speech patterns and develop an accurate facsimile by using just a 10-minute digital recording.¹²⁸ ## V. CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO ESPIONAGE A large amount of the cyber operations performed by a military will involve the collection of data or intelligence stored on another state’s network or analyzing the configuration of the network. These types of actions, provided they do not disrupt, deny, degrade, manipulate, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, should not be considered cyber warfare operations. The international community should view such activities as a form of espionage or cyber espionage. Espionage is the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, ¹²³ Id.\n¹²⁴ Id.\n¹²⁵ William M.

These two incidents demonstrate how espionage in the computer age has changed. Nevertheless, at its core, it is still espionage and should be looked at differently then cyber warfare operations when attempting to establish lawful or unlawful activities under international law.\nIn the Moonlight Maze incident, hackers from Russia penetrated Department of Defense computers for over a year, stealing vast amounts of sensitive information.¹³⁹ According to Pentagon and FBI officials, Moonlight Maze was a state-sponsored Russian intelligence campaign to secure U.S. technology, which targeted not just the Department of Defense, but also the Department of Energy, NASA, military contractors and military-linked civilian universities.¹⁴⁰ In this incident, the Department of Defense did not report any damage or destruction of networks.¹⁴¹ Roberta Gross, the NASA Inspector General, stated, “It’s difficult to tell what the damage is... They weren’t shutting down systems. They were taking file listings, looking to see what’s in people’s directories.”¹⁴² Richard Clark sees the Moonlight Maze intrusions as “pre-war reconnaissance where half a dozen nations are busy scanning each other’s networks to get a good map of where the key things are and what are the key vulnerabilities of those networks.”¹⁴³ Titan Rain is the name given to a series of coordinated attacks, believed to be Chinese in origin, on U.S. computer systems since 2003.¹⁴⁴ The precise nature, whether state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, is uncertain.¹⁴⁵ The United States traced the attacks to the Chinese province of Guangdong and, according to Alan Paller, director of the SANS Institute, the techniques used make it appear unlikely to come from any other source than the military.¹⁴⁶ The hackers are thought to have stolen U.S. military secrets from the Redstone Arsenal, home to the Army Aviation ¹³⁷ Scott, supra note 134, at 218.\n¹³⁸ Jennifer J.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND USE OF FORCE The maintenance of international peace and security was the primary reason for creating the United Nations.¹⁴⁸ The U.N. Charter and general international law provide for an absolute prohibition on the use of force by states, except in the case of legitimate self-defense laid down in Article 51 of the Charter.¹⁴⁹ Article 2(3) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members states “shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.”¹⁵⁰ Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”¹⁵¹ Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which provides the sole exception to use of force by individual Members without express Security Council sanction, states: Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.

United States*, the International Court of Justice confirmed that the prohibition on the use of force was also a principle of customary international law.¹⁵³ However, exactly what kinds of action constitute a use of force or armed attack is debatable, as the U.N. Charter does not define either phrase.\nA good place to look at what may constitute a use of force or an armed attack is the General Assembly’s resolution defining ¹⁴⁷ Tom Espiner, *Security experts Lift Lid on Chinese hack attacks*, ZDNET.COM, Nov. 23, 2005, http://news.zdnet.com/2100-1009_22-145763.html (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n¹⁴⁸ SEAN D.

Charter; it states, “aggression is the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in this definition.”¹⁵⁵ Article 3 of this Resolution lists seven acts that qualify as acts of aggression and Article 4 notes that these enumerated acts are “not exhaustive.”\nWhen analyzing whether cyber warfare operations violate the territorial integrity of another nation, the U-2 incident of 1960 is a good place to start. This involved the downing of an unarmed U.S. reconnaissance plane by a SA-2 surface to air missile (SAM) 1,200 miles inside the Soviet Union.¹⁵⁶ The Soviet Union asserted that U-2 flights over Soviet territory were acts of aggression; however, the U.N. Security Council disagreed, concluding that while the U-2 flight violated Soviet airspace it did not constitute an unlawful use of force in regards to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.¹⁵⁷ If infringement upon the sovereign airspace of another nation does not rise to the level of an unlawful use of force, perhaps infringement upon another nation’s networks does not automatically rise to the level of an unlawful use of force. However, it appears self defense actions necessary to stop the intrusion may be permitted. This U-2 incident analysis would be appropriate for most forms of cyber espionage discussed in Section IV, where the operation consists only of the gathering of data from target or adversary automated information systems or networks, like the Titan Rain and Moonlight Maze examples. While illegal under domestic law, these operations do not constitute an unlawful use of force under international law.¹⁵⁸ However, when more than mere data gathering is involved, the issue becomes less clear. For example, is a DoS attack on one nation by another, which results in the inability of the attacked nation to access web sites and networks, considered an unlawful use of force?\n¹⁵⁴ Definition of Aggression, G.A.

Id.\nCyber Warfare Operations 143 In April 2007, important websites in Estonia, including the website of the president, parliament, ministries, political parties, major news outlets, and Estonia’s two dominant banks, were hit by a series of DoS attacks.¹⁵⁹ These attacks continued until mid-June.¹⁶⁰ A Defense Ministry spokesman said sites that usually received 1,000 visits a day were buried under as many as 2,000 a second.¹⁶¹ Officials in Estonia accused Russia of orchestrating the attacks and security officials traced the initial attacks to Russian servers, including domains registered to the government and to the administration of then President Putin.¹⁶² The Kremlin has repeatedly denied government involvement in the attacks, dismissing Estonia’s complaints as fabrications.¹⁶³ Estonia reported the attacks to the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).¹⁶⁴ The NATO Treaty, which Estonia and most EU Member States are a party to, provides that an attack on one of its members shall be considered an attack against all and enables party nations to exercise the right of self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.¹⁶⁵ Estonian Defense Minister Jaak Aaviksoo called the attacks a national security situation and compared the situation to the shutdown of sea ports.¹⁶⁶ This comparison is interesting as Article 3(c) of the General Assembly’s resolution defining aggression lists “the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another State” as an act of aggression.¹⁶⁷ However, it should be noted that Article 41 of the U.N. Charter cites “complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means of communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”¹⁶⁸ After discussing the situation with NATO officials, Mr. Aaviksoo stated, “at present, NATO does not define cyber-attacks as a clear military action.

Charter prohibits the use of force, the international community appears to have concluded that unattributable DoS attacks will not automatically qualify as violating this prohibition.¹⁷⁹ The attack on Estonia briefly upset the operations of some government organizations, including telephone access to the emergency services.¹⁸⁰ However, as discussed above, NATO did not seem to view these attacks as violating the prohibition against the use of force. Ultimately, the international community characterized the Estonian attack as cyber crime or cyber terrorism.¹⁸¹ The actual damage done in the Georgia incident was minimal; it included some e-mail disruption and public unavailability of some target sites. Again, there was no conclusive evidence that the Russian government executed or sanctioned either set of attacks, although there was no evidence that it tried to stop them either.¹⁸² Similar to the Estonia example, this would probably have to be viewed as cyber crime or cyber terrorism. This would most likely hold true even if the attacks could be attributed back to Russia or if Russia was deemed to “effectively control” the non-state actor, which the Court in Nicaragua v. U.S. recognized as the standard for attributing the acts of a non-state actor to the state.¹⁸³ This is supported by the legal task team from the NATO-accredited Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, Estonia, which concluded that “it is highly problematic to apply the Law of Armed Conflict to the Georgian cyber attacks – the objective facts of the case are too vague to meet the necessary criteria of both state involvement and gravity of effect.”¹⁸⁴ What level of impact would it take to rise to a prohibited use of force, and what level of government attribution would justify defensive use of force against a state? Arguably, more than just interfering with a government web site or causing minimal disruption of government services is needed to constitute a prohibited use of force. But what about the interfering with, or disruption of, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, and nuclear power plant safety systems? This is likely one of the next scenarios regarding the issue of ¹⁷⁸ Siobhan Gorman, Cyberattacks on Georgian Web Sites Are Reigniting a Washington Debate, WALL ST.

A recently recorded demonstration conducted by government researchers, called the Aurora Generator Test, investigated a dangerous vulnerability in computers at U.S. utility companies. The test illustrated the potential destruction caused by seizing control of a crucial part of the U.S. electrical grid—an industrial turbine spinning wildly out of control until it becomes a smoking hulk and the power shuts down.¹⁸⁵ The video, produced for the Homeland Security Department, shows commands quietly triggered by simulated hackers having such a violent reaction that the enormous turbine shudders as pieces fly apart and it belches black-and-white smoke.¹⁸⁶ While this electrical attack was a controlled test, the CIA warned in January 2008 that a cyber attack did cause a power blackout in multiple cities outside the United States.¹⁸⁷ Tom Donahue, a CIA senior analyst, informed attendees at a SANS Institute conference that the CIA has information that cyber attackers have disrupted power equipment in several regions outside the U.S. and, in at least one case, the disruption caused a power outage affecting multiple cities.¹⁸⁸ Donahue added that the CIA does not know who executed the attacks or why, but that all of the attacks involved intrusions through the internet.¹⁸⁹ These cyber intrusions into utility systems were deliberate and followed by extortion demands.¹⁹⁰ This clearly demonstrates the capability exists to bring down SCADA systems.\nArguably, a cyber attack that causes physical damage might constitute an armed attack under Article 51,¹⁹¹ and the Aurora Generator Test provides an example of a cyber warfare operation resulting in physical damage. SCADA attacks could also result in death by, for example, shutting down power to a hospital or an Air Traffic Control tower.\nMichael Schmitt, Dean and Professor of International Law at the George C. Marshall Center, has argued that an action can be defined as an armed attack if that action is intended to cause injury, death, ¹⁸⁵ Ted Bridis &amp; Eileen Sullivan, *US Video Shows Hacker Hit on Power Grid*, SFGATE.COM (SAN.

This potential consequences standard would prohibit most types of cyber warfare operations against SCADA systems, such as interfering with control elements of the power grid, air traffic control networks, or nuclear power plant safety systems, since this would cause or have the potential to cause physical damage, injury, or death. Adopting this set standard would assist nations in determining when it would be lawful to exercise their inherent right of self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.\nWhen responding to such an attack it is important to remember that nothing in Article 51 limits a nation’s response to the method of attack utilized by the aggressor. The only limitation on exercising self-defense is that the defensive force must be necessary and proportionate to the armed attack that gave rise to the right. This limitation under customary international law was asserted by U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster, who in response to a British claim of self-defense in an incident known as the *Caroline Affair*, wrote that in order to be justified, the use of force in self-defense must be necessary and proportionate under the circumstances of the particular case.¹⁹³ This standard of necessary and proportionate was confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case and in its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*. In the *Nicaragua* case, the court found there was a well established rule in customary international law whereby self-defense would warrant only measures which were proportional to the armed attack and necessary to respond to it.¹⁹⁴ In its *Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons*, the Court stated, “the submission of the exercise of the right of self-defence to the conditions of necessity and proportionality is a rule of customary international law”¹⁹⁵ and “this dual condition applies equally to Article 51 of the Charter, whatever the means of force employed.”¹⁹⁶ Therefore, a nation’s response is not limited to a specific weapon or type of attack as long as the response is necessary and proportionate under the circumstances.

CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS AND THE LAW OF WAR Cyber warfare operations are likely to be used in future armed conflicts. Because a state may use a cyber attack against an enemy in order to cause damage, it is indisputably a method of warfare.¹⁹⁷ Therefore, it is important to analyze the use of cyber warfare operations in relation to the law of war. The law of war, also referred to as the law of armed conflict, applies to a state of international armed conflict, and applies equally to all parties to the conflict. As with other areas of international law, the law of war consists of treaties and customary international law; the primary sources being the Hague Regulations, the Geneva Conventions, and the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. While the general principles of the law of war have been expressed numerous ways, this article will divide them into the following six categories: (1) military necessity, (2) distinction, (3) proportionality, (4) unnecessary suffering, (5) perfidy, and (6) neutrality. These principles provide the foundation of the law of war. This section will look at these principles, then proceed to a discussion on targeting, and conclude by addressing how potential types of cyber warfare operations during an armed conflict may be viewed in relation to the law of war.\n### A. General Principles of the Law of War #### 1. Military Necessity The principle of military necessity justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible.¹⁹⁸ U.S. Army General Order No. 100, commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, originally codified this principle in 1863.¹⁹⁹ Article 52(2) of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions (Additional Protocol I) provides a definition of military objectives which many consider to reflect ¹⁹⁷ Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n¹⁹⁸ See U.S. DEP’T OF ARMY, FIELD MANUAL 27-10, *THE LAW ON LAND WARFARE* para. 3(a) (July 18, 1956) [hereinafter FM 27-10]; see also Hague Convention IV, art. 23(g).\n¹⁹⁹ Jefferson D. Reynolds, *Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground*, 56 A.F. L. REV. 1, 6 (2005).\nCyber Warfare Operations 149 customary international law.²⁰⁰ It states that a military attack is lawful only against “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.”²⁰¹ ## 2. Distinction According to an uncontroversial principle of customary international law, parties to an armed conflict must distinguish between the civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military objectives.²⁰² Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Convention (Protocol II) applies in situations of internal armed conflict and also incorporates the principle of distinction. It states, “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”²⁰³ and also “the civilian population... as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.”²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II provides that civilians shall enjoy these protections during internal armed conflicts “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁰⁵ ## 3. Proportionality The principle of proportionality prohibits the use of any kind or degree of force that exceeds that needed to accomplish the military objective.²⁰⁶ Collateral damage incurred while attacking a military objective does not necessarily equate to a violation of international law, provided the collateral damage is proportional to the military advantage ²⁰⁰ Marco Sassòli, Legitimate Target of Attacks, Under International Humanitarian Law 2 (background paper for Informal High-Level Expert Meeting on Reaff. &amp; Dev. of Int’l Hum. Law, Cambridge, Jan. 27-29, 2003), available at http://www.ihlresearch.org/ihl/pdfs/Session1.pdf.\n²⁰¹ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), art. 52(2), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 3 [hereinafter Additional Protocol I].\n²⁰² Sassòli, supra note 200, at 1. Additional Protocol I, Article 48, states this basic rule as, “the Parties to the conflict shall at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants and between civilian objects and military objectives and accordingly shall direct their operations only against military objectives.” Additional Protocol I, art. 48.\n²⁰³ Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), art. 13(1), June 8, 1977, 1125 U.N.T.S. 609, [hereinafter Additional Protocol II].\n²⁰⁴ Additional Protocol II, art. 13(2).\n²⁰⁵ Id. art. 13(3).\n²⁰⁶ Rod Powers, Law of Armed Conflict, ABOUT.COM: US MILITARY, at 2, http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/wars/a/loac.htm (last visited Sept. 9, 2009).\n\ngained. The law of war requires one to weigh the expected collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by the operation. The ultimate question under the principle of proportionality is whether the collateral damage is excessive in relation to the military advantage gained.\nAdditional Protocol I, Article 51(5)(b), provides that “an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated”²⁰⁷ shall be considered an indiscriminate attack. Additional Protocol I, Article 51(4), defines three types of indiscriminate attacks: (1) attacks that “are not directed against a specific military objective,”²⁰⁸ (2) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effect of which cannot be directed at a specific military objective,”²⁰⁹ and, (3) attacks that “employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol.”²¹⁰ Under Additional Protocol I, it is a grave breach to launch an attack knowing it will cause excessive collateral damage in relation to the military advantage gained.²¹¹ ## 4. Unnecessary Suffering Hague Convention IV, Article 22, provides that “the rights of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.”²¹² Hague Convention IV, Article 23(e), specifically prohibits the employment “of arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.”²¹³ This principle prohibits the use of weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and the use of otherwise lawful weapons if used in a manner that causes unnecessary suffering.\n## 5. Perfidy Treacherous or perfidious conduct in war is forbidden under the law of war because it destroys the basis for a restoration of peace short of the complete annihilation of one belligerent by the other.²¹⁴ Hague Convention IV, Article 23(b), states, “to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army,” is forbidden.²¹⁵ Cyber Warfare Operations 151 Perfidy involves injuring the enemy by using his adherence to the law of war against him. Additional Protocol I, Article 37(1), also states, “it is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to perfidy”²¹⁶ and “acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy.”²¹⁷ Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare*, provides: The line of demarcation between legitimate ruses and forbidden acts of perfidy is sometimes indistinct, but the following examples indicate the correct principles. It would be an improper practice to secure an advantage of the enemy by deliberate lying or misleading conduct which involves a breach of faith, or when there is a moral obligation to speak the truth. For example, it is improper to feign surrender so as to secure an advantage over the opposing belligerent thereby. So similarly, to broadcast to the enemy that an armistice had been agreed upon when such is not the case would be treacherous. On the other hand, it is a perfectly proper ruse to summon a force to surrender on the ground that it is surrounded and thereby induce such surrender with a small force.²¹⁸ Because cyber espionage is likely to become an important intelligence gathering tool, states will likely plant misinformation on their own networks to confuse or mislead the enemy. Such misinformation is synonymous with any other method for delivering misinformation.²¹⁹ ## 6. Neutrality Neutrality is an essential tenet of international law.²²⁰ Neutrality affords states the right to maintain relations with all belligerents.²²¹ States that declare themselves neutral, and behave ²¹⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 37(1).\n²¹⁷ *Id.* The following examples are provided: the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender; the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness, the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status, and the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.\n²¹⁸ FM 27-10, *supra* note 198, ¶ 50.\n²¹⁹ See Dormann, *supra* note 13.\n²²⁰ *Korns* &amp; *Kastenberg*, *supra* note 12, at 73.\n²²¹ *Id.* at 62.\n\naccordingly, are entitled to immunity from attack.²²² Under the principle of neutrality a neutral state’s territory is to be secure from assault or trespass.²²³ Also, belligerents are forbidden from moving troops, munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral state.²²⁴ However, should the neutral state fail for any reason to prevent violations of its neutrality by the troops of one belligerent entering or passing through its territory, the other belligerent may be justified in attacking the enemy forces on this territory.²²⁵ Authors in the cyber law arena have suggested that in order to remain neutral in a cyber conflict a state cannot originate a cyber attack, and it also has to take action to prevent a cyber attack from transiting its internet nodes.²²⁶ Neutrality becomes problematic for cyber warfare operations because the weapons of cyber warfare, such as requests being sent by computer systems from which DoS attacks originate or the malicious code that travels along networks, cannot always be predicted. For example, when one server goes down, internet traffic is automatically rerouted via another.²²⁷ Additionally, a neutral state may not be able to prevent cyber warfare operations from leaving its jurisdiction unless it severs all connections with computer systems in other states. Placing such a duty on any and all neutral states is unreasonable and would likely grind the internet to a halt.²²⁸ ## B. Targeting Military objectives are legitimate targets. Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), defines military objectives as “those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage.”²²⁹ Objects which, by their nature, make an effective contribution to military action would include objects directly used by the armed force, such as: weapons, equipment, transports, fortifications, depots, buildings occupied by armed forces, staff ²²² Id.\n²²³ Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, art. 1, Oct. 18, 1907, 26 Stat. 2310, U.S.T. 540 (which states “the territory of neutral Powers is inviolable”) [hereinafter Hague Convention V].\n²²⁴ Id. art. 2.\n²²⁵ FM 27-10 supra note 198, ¶ 520.\n²²⁶ Korns &amp; Kastenberg, supra note 12, at 62; Jeffrey T.G.

Combatants are members of the armed forces of a state party to a conflict, other than medical personnel and chaplains.²³⁶ These individuals have the right to participate directly in hostilities.²³⁷ Combatants “consist of all organized armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to that state for the conduct of its subordinates.”²³⁸ Combatants are required to “distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack.”²³⁹ Combatants also consist of “members of militias and volunteer corps, including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a state, party to the conflict, provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements” meet specific requirements.²⁴⁰ ²³⁰ Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June, 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, art. 43, ¶ 2020 (Yves Sandoz, Christophe Swinarski, Bruno Zimmermann eds., 1987), available at http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/470-750067?OpenDocument.\n²³¹ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2021.\n²³² Id. art. 43, ¶ 2022.\n²³³ Id.\n²³⁴ Id.\n²³⁵ Id. art. 43, ¶ 2024.\n²³⁶ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 43(2).\n²³⁷ Id.\n²³⁸ Id. art. 43(1).\n²³⁹ Id. art. 44(3).\n²⁴⁰ Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (III), art. 4(A)(2), Aug. 12, 1949, 20 U.S.T. 3316, 75 U.N.T.S. 135 [hereinafter Geneva Convention III]. These requirements include “being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;” Unlike combatants, the law of war prohibits direct attacks on non-combatants. Non-combatants may be divided into two groups: civilians and enemy personnel out of combat. A civilian is a person who is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and who does not take a direct part in hostilities.²⁴¹ The general rule regarding civilians is that the civilian population, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack.²⁴² Additionally, acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population, are prohibited.²⁴³ Civilians enjoy protection from targeting “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.”²⁴⁴ The major categories of individuals considered to be personnel out of combat are prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, medical personnel, and chaplains.\n## 2. Targeting Places Hague Convention IV, Article 25, prohibits the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings that are undefended.²⁴⁵ Additional Protocol I, Article 52, provides that “civilian objects, which consist of all objects that are not military objectives, shall not be the object of attack...”²⁴⁶ Moreover, “in case of doubt whether an object which is normally dedicated to civilian purposes, such as a place of worship, a house or other dwelling or a school, is being used to make an effective contribution to military action, it shall be presumed not to be so used.”²⁴⁷ Additional Protocol 1, Article 56, states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁴⁸ This wear a “fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;” “carrying arms openly;” and conduct their operations “in accordance with the laws and customs of war.” *Id.* ²⁴¹ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 50(1).\n²⁴² *Id.* art. 51(2).\n²⁴³ *Id.* ²⁴⁴ *Id.* art. 51(3).\n²⁴⁵ Hague Convention IV, art. 25.\n²⁴⁶ Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 52(1).\n²⁴⁷ *Id.* art. 52(3).\n²⁴⁸ *Id.* art. 56(1); see also Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 56(2) (provides that this special protection against attack shall cease: for a dam or a dyke only if it is used for other than its normal function and in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for a nuclear electrical generating station only if it provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support; for other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations only if they are used in regular, significant and Cyber Warfare Operations 155 protection terminates, however, if the enemy is using them in specific ways to support its war effort.²⁴⁹ Moreover, “other military objectives located at or in the vicinity of these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces from the works or installations and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.”²⁵⁰ It needs to be noted that the U.S. has not ratified Additional Protocol I and specifically objects, for military reasons, to Article 56.²⁵¹ The objection is that this Article disregards the longstanding principle of proportionality and prohibits the attack if there are to be “severe” civilian losses, no matter how important the target may be from a military point of view.²⁵² ## 3. Dual-Use Targets Dual-use targets are most commonly defined as those targets that are used for both military and civilian purposes, such as power plants that provide electricity to both civilian institutions as well as military command and control centers.²⁵³ Civilian objects that may fall into this dual-use category would include computer networks of certain research facilities, air traffic control networks that regulate both civilian and military aircraft, computerized civilian logistics systems upon which military supplies will be moved, electronic power grid control networks, communications nodes and systems, including satellite and other space-based systems, railroad and other transportation systems, civilian government networks, and oil and gas distribution systems.²⁵⁴ As previously discussed, Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), essentially provides two requirements for an object to qualify as a military objective. First, the target must make an effective contribution to the enemy's military action. Second, its destruction must provide a definite military advantage to the attacker.²⁵⁵ The use of the phrase “make an effective contribution” does not limit targets to only military direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support).\n²⁴⁹ Id.\n²⁵⁰ Id. art. 56(1).\n²⁵¹ See Howard S.

However, just as with a non dual-use object, a proportionality test must be performed to ensure the collateral damage to civilians or civilian objects is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” 256 A 2003 Human Rights Watch briefing paper on international humanitarian law summarized the concept of dual-use object as follows: Dual-use objects serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. A dual-use object may presumptively be a legitimate military target because it contributes, in part, to concrete military aims, yet the harm to the civilian population in its destruction may still be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, rendering an attack impermissible.257 The international community accepts the right of states to target dual-use targets. For example, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Claims Commission determined that Additional Protocol I, Article 52(2), is customary international law.258 The Commission, ruling on the aerial bombardment of the Hirgigo power station, stated, “a large power plant being constructed to provide power for an area including a major port and naval facility certainly would seem to be an object the destruction of which would offer a distinct military advantage.”259 The Commission ultimately found that Ethiopia’s aerial bombardment of the power station was not unlawful.260 However, many situations exist where targeting dual-use targets through cyber warfare operations would be unlawful; such as when targeting civilian morale is the main objective and destroying a legitimate military objective is secondary. For example, shutting down an entire communication network within a large city that has only a small military presence or disabling television transmissions in order to prevent the showing of military recruitment advertisements would be unlawful dual-use targeting.\n\nCyber Warfare Operations 157 C. Analysis Cyber warfare operations have the capability of being a very effective option during an armed conflict. Some obvious benefits include less physical destruction, less cost than other types of traditional warfare, and the ability to still achieve the same results with less risk to military personnel. An example of this would be a cyber warfare operation against another state’s air defense networks to render them temporarily or permanently inoperable. At present, the weapon most often associated with the suppression of enemy air defenses, or SEAD, is the anti-radiation missile delivered by tactical fighters.²⁶¹ However, a SEAD weapon could be anything that damages or destroys a component of an air defense system.²⁶² Using a cyber warfare operation to accomplish this, rather than an airstrike, is a good example of satisfying Additional Protocol I, Article 57, which states, “when a choice is possible between several military objectives for obtaining a similar military advantage, the objective to be selected shall be the attack on which may be expected to cause the least danger to civilian lives and to civilian objects.”²⁶³ This example demonstrates the non-physical destruction aspect of cyber warfare operations, which in many cases will reduce the expected collateral damage to civilians and civilian property.\nWhen analyzing the lawfulness of a cyber warfare operation one should conduct the same analysis as when determining the lawfulness of an aircraft targeting a military objective. For example, a DoS attack against enemy command and control servers could overwhelm the servers and prevent leadership from operating at their highest level. This example would appear lawful under the laws of war as the command and control servers are a lawful military objective. Furthermore, the resulting collateral damage would be limited to mere inconvenience for civilians using the shared network. Additionally, if the attacker only targets military command and control servers, one may argue that civilians on the system are taking a direct part in hostilities anyway. This operation may limit the need for traditional means and methods of warfare to impact command and control operations, such as directly targeting the structures housing the servers or the power sources to the servers through air or land attacks. This analysis also applies to cyber warfare operations that target the email accounts of military personnel and government leaders, or the telephone servers and routers servicing the same individuals. This disruption of useful electronic information exchange would also limit the collateral damage compared ²⁶¹ Wikipedia.org, SEAD, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEAD (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n²⁶² Id.\n²⁶³ Additional Protocol I, supra note 201, art. 57(3).\n\nto a conventional attack intended to accomplish the same results, and would therefore be lawful.\nA more difficult example to analyze is the altering of electronic maintenance manuals of an adversary’s aircraft stored on a network. While the targeting of enemy aircraft is a proper military objective, a complete analysis must consider the intent of the attack. If the operation is designed to make the aircraft inoperable, at least temporarily, then it would appear to be lawful. However, if the intent is to have the aircraft malfunction in flight, further analysis must be accomplished. Specifically, it is necessary to weigh the anticipated collateral damage against the concrete and direct military advantage gained by the operation. In this example, the military advantage gained is the anticipated loss of an adversary’s aircraft and possibly the pilot. The anticipated collateral damage depends on when the malfunction occurs. Under traditional methods of attack against enemy aircraft, such as by anti-aircraft artillery or engagement by another aircraft, it is possible to attempt to minimize collateral damage by limiting the place of attacks. However, deliberately causing an aircraft to malfunction by altering maintenance manuals may result in an aircraft’s malfunctioning over a highly populated area. This may, or may not, make the operation unlawful.\nAlteration of electronic maintenance manuals may be a proper ruse because it aims to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but does not infringe on any rules of international law applicable in armed conflict or invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under the law. An additional goal of this type of ruse may be to cause the enemy forces to distrust electronic information, adding extra time to accomplish their tasks by resorting to the use of non-electronic methods. However, not all alterations of electronic information will qualify as a lawful ruse. For example, distributing fake orders from leaders may be found unlawful if it causes personnel to believe there is a truce or that they cannot target a particular area because it is a protected site. This would be similar to misusing a protected symbol such as a white flag or a red cross. Additionally, altering an adversary’s medical records may be seen as violating the principle of unnecessary suffering if the individual is provided improper care. Moreover, the altering of medical records may also be seen as attacking a medical facility and therefore unlawful.\nCyber warfare operations that cause permanent damage may include deleting military files and inserting malicious code in military communication networks.²⁶⁴ Deleting military files, or even the ²⁶⁴ A network is defined as a group of two or more computer systems linked together. See Webopedia.com, network, http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/n/network.html (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\nCyber Warfare Operations 159 annihilation of military computer networks, would constitute a proper military objective. These types of cyber warfare operations would result in the same outcome as using precision guided missiles to target specific military buildings without the resulting collateral damage to infrastructure. With proper intelligence gathering and operational planning, the attacker could avoid networks dedicated solely to medical facilities; otherwise, the attacks may be deemed to be indiscriminate.\nCyber warfare operations targeting local internet service or telecommunication providers may result in less collateral damage to the civilian population or civilian population surrounding the targeted object and, as a consequence, create more opportunities for targeting dual-use objects. In this example the military advantage to be gained is the disruption in the enemy's ability to communicate effectively. The collateral damage to civilians and civilian objects is the disruption in their ability to communicate effectively and potential economic loss for local communication providers. When the military advantage gained is compared to the collateral damage one can logically label this an appropriate targeting of a dual-use object. The Commission in the Eritrea-Ethiopia noted,\"the infliction of economic losses from attacks against military objectives is a lawful means of achieving a definite military advantage.\"²⁶⁵ ## VIII. OTHER TREATIES AND CONVENTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT CYBER WARFARE OPERATIONS The law of state responsibility deals with the circumstances under which a state is responsible for an internationally wrongful act and the consequences of that responsibility.²⁶⁶ This law of state responsibility is considered customary international law.²⁶⁷ The breach of a treaty constitutes an internationally wrongful act.²⁶⁸ Therefore, it is important that states are familiar with particular international obligations that may impact cyber warfare operations. This section will examine a few areas states should consider when developing plans for cyber warfare operations.\nAir Force Law Review • Volume 64 A. International Outer Space Law The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) was created by the U.N. in 1959.²⁶⁹ The purpose of COPUOS is to review the scope of international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, to devise U.N. programs in this field, to encourage continued research and the dissemination of information on outer space matters, and to study legal problems arising from the exploration of outer space.²⁷⁰ COPUOS is the only international forum for the development of international space law. Since its inception, the Committee concluded five international legal instruments and five sets of legal principles governing space-related activities.²⁷¹ The five international treaties are: the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty),²⁷² the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement),²⁷³ the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention),²⁷⁴ the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention),²⁷⁵ and the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Moon Treaty).²⁷⁶ The Outer Space Treaty and the Liability Convention both include language that may impact cyber warfare operations.\n²⁶⁹ G.A.

Res. 34/68, annex, Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (July 11, 1984).\nCyber Warfare Operations 161\n\n# 1. Outer Space Treaty\nThe Outer Space Treaty furnishes a general legal basis for the peaceful uses of outer space and provides a framework for the developing law of outer space.²⁷⁷ While, peaceful use is not defined in outer space law, some states consistently maintain the view that peaceful means non-military.²⁷⁸ However, the majority of the international community generally accepts non-aggressive military uses as peaceful.²⁷⁹ The U.S. maintains this view and stresses that all states possess the inherent right to defend against foreign aggression in outer space, as well as within earth’s atmosphere.²⁸⁰ Despite the debate over the peaceful use of outer space, its meaning has been well settled through the practice of states and it certainly includes some military activities.²⁸¹\nArticle IX of the Outer Space Treaty relates to a state’s duty to engage in international consultations prior to engaging in activities which the state “has reason to believe . . . would cause potentially harmful interference with activities of other States Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space . . .”²⁸² The wording of this Article only protects assets used for peaceful purposes, so by exclusion it may permit potentially harmful interference performed through cyber warfare operations targeting space assets, such as satellites of other States, if the targeted assets are not used for a peaceful purpose. Therefore, the targeting of a military satellite supporting the enemy’s war fighting capability during hostilities would be permissible. Hence, a state may conduct a cyber warfare operation that hacks into an adversary’s satellite’s network and installs malicious code that causes the satellite to shut down or malfunction, or hijack control of an adversary’s satellite. In these situations no international consultation would be necessary. However, the state’s treaty obligations would remain in effect in regards to neutral parties. Therefore, to the extent that a cyber warfare operation in space could harmfully interfere with a non-belligerent state’s asset, it would appear Article IX would require consultation with the neutral state.²⁸³ Nevertheless, nothing in Article IX impedes carrying through with such an operation once consultations have occurred, even if the third-party state objects to the anticipated activity.²⁸⁴\n²⁷⁷ UNITED NATIONS TREATIES AND PRINCIPLES ON OUTER SPACE foreword (2002).\n²⁷⁸ See Major Robert A. Ramey, *Armed Conflict on the Final Frontier: The Law of War in Space*, 48 A.F. L. REV. 1, 79 (2000).\n²⁷⁹ Id.\n²⁸⁰ Id.\n²⁸¹ Id.\n²⁸² Id. at 77; Outer Space Treaty, supra note 272, art. IX.\n²⁸³ Id.\n²⁸⁴ Id.\nSpace assets also create dual-use issues, specifically regarding commercial assets. For example, remote sensing, weather and telecommunications satellites are functionally equivalent to military reconnaissance satellites. A military may use such a satellite to support the prosecution of its wartime objectives while at the same time the satellite is being used for non-military purposes.²⁸⁵ Indeed, commercial entities provide about 60 percent of the satellite communications used by the U.S. military.²⁸⁶ As discussed earlier, the test to determine the lawfulness of an attack against a military objective is whether the expected incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof clearly exceeds the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.²⁸⁷ On this basis, the United States lawfully destroyed major infrastructure targets during the 1991 Persian Gulf War that provided electricity both to the civilian populations and to the command and control functions of the Iraqi military.²⁸⁸ A similar rationale applies to dual-use satellites. To the extent a satellite is used for the support of a military purpose, such as communications, weather, early warning of missile launch, or reconnaissance, it becomes a military objective and is lawfully subject to attack.²⁸⁹\nTo conclude, the Outer Space Treaty essentially prohibits potentially harmful interference with activities of other states in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, and prohibits the use of force in outer space. However, if a state uses a space asset in a non-peaceful manner, then it should be considered a proper target for cyber warfare operations, although if such interference impacts a neutral state’s peaceful exploration and use of outer space, a consultation may be required.\n## 2. Liability Convention\nThe Liability Convention establishes procedures for determining state liability for activities in outer space. The Convention makes a launching state absolutely liable for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.²⁹⁰ In the event of damage being caused elsewhere, liability attaches only if the damage\n²⁸⁵ *Id.* at 148-149.\n²⁸⁶ Elizabeth Waldrop, *Integration of Military and Civilian Space Assets: Legal and National Security Implications*, 55 A.F. L. REV. 157, 200 (2004) (citing Katie McConnell, *Military Satellite Communications: The March Toward Commercialization*, DEFENSE DAILY (2003)).\n²⁸⁷ See Additional Protocol I, *supra* note 201, art. 51(5)(b).\n²⁸⁸ *Ramey*, *supra* note 278, at 150.\n²⁸⁹ *Id.*\n²⁹⁰ *Liability Convention*, *supra* note 274, art. II.\nCyber Warfare Operations 163\nis the state’s fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.²⁹¹ The Convention provides exoneration from absolute liability to the extent that a launching state establishes the damage resulted either wholly or partially from gross negligence or from an act or omission done with intent to cause damage on the part of a claimant state.²⁹² However, no exoneration will be granted in cases where the damage has resulted from activities conducted by a launching state which are not in conformity with international law.²⁹³\nTherefore, a state conducting cyber warfare operations against another state’s satellite may be liable to the launching state for the damage done to the satellite and by the satellite, as a result of operations against it. For example, an operation that simply rendered a satellite useless may leave the state that conducted the cyber warfare operation liable for the value of the satellite. Whereas, an operation which deorbited a satellite, causing it to fall back to earth, may leave the state liable for the resulting damage as well.²⁹⁴\nThe Liability Convention does not provide a military exception excusing a state from liability during an armed conflict. However, one may argue that under the law of war, a state has no duty to pay for damage done to lawful targets.²⁹⁵\n## B. International Telecommunications Law\nCyber warfare operations involving the targeting of telecommunication networks may implicate the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)²⁹⁶ and its underlying charter, the International Telecommunication Convention (ITC)²⁹⁷ as the ITC contains several provisions which may apply to cyber warfare operations. For example, Article 35 of the ITC prohibits harmful interference with the radio spectrum.\nAll stations, whatever their purpose, must be established and operated in such a manner as not to cause harmful interference to the radio services or communications of other Members or of recognized\n²⁹¹ *Id.* art. III.\n²⁹² *Id.* art. VI(1).\n²⁹³ *Id.* art. VI(2).\n²⁹⁴ See, e.g., Wingfield, *supra* note 18, at 327-328.\n²⁹⁵ See, e.g., *id.*\n²⁹⁶ See International Telecommunication Union, About ITU, http://www.itu.int/net/about/index.aspx (last visited Sept. 14, 2009). The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the UN specialized agency responsible for promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunication.\n²⁹⁷ International Telecommunications Convention, Nairobi, Nov. 6, 1982, 32 U.S.T. 3821 [hereinafter ITU Convention].\n\nprivate operating agencies, or of other duly authorized operating agencies which carry on radio service, and which operate in accordance with the provisions of the Radio Regulations.²⁹⁸ Harmful interference is defined as “interference which endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of other safety services or seriously degrades, obstructs or repeatedly interrupts a radio communication service operating in accordance with the Radio Regulations.”²⁹⁹ Article 37 of the ITC may also impact cyber warfare operations. It requires members to prevent the transmission of false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals, and to collaborate in locating and identifying stations transmitting such signals from their own country.³⁰⁰ Other articles of the ITC worth noting include Article 19(2), which permits members to cut off private telecommunications that may appear dangerous to the security of the State or contrary to its laws, to public order or to decency³⁰¹ and Article 20, which permits members to suspend the international telecommunication service for an indefinite time, either generally or only for certain relations or for certain kinds of correspondence, outgoing, incoming or in transit.³⁰² Article 38 addresses military radio stations and provides that “members retain their entire freedom with regard to military radio installations.”³⁰³ This article further notes that “these installations must, so far as possible, observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to the measures to be taken to prevent harmful interference, and the provisions of the Administrative Regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used...”³⁰⁴ Radio Regulations coordinate and standardize the operation of telecommunication networks and services.³⁰⁵ An example of a Radio Regulation potentially impacting cyber warfare operations is Regulation Article 18, which provides that states may not carry out the transmission of false or misleading signals.³⁰⁶ This prohibition does not ²⁹⁸ Id. art. 35 ²⁹⁹ Id. annex 2.\n³⁰⁰ Id. art. 37.\n³⁰¹ Id. art. 19(2).\n³⁰² Id. art. 20.\n³⁰³ Id. art. 38(1).\n³⁰⁴ Id. art. 38(2).\n³⁰⁵ Wikipedia.org, Radio Regulations, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Regulations (last visited Sep. 9, 2009).\n³⁰⁶ See LAWRENCE T.

Bender, The Case of the Sarah: A Testing Ground for the Regulation of Radio Piracy in the United States, 12 FORDHAM INT’L L.J. 67, 69 (1988)).\nCyber Warfare Operations 165 apply to the truth or falsehood of the underlying substance of a transmission, but to the identification of its transmitter and frequency.³⁰⁷ To conclude, cyber warfare operations to disrupt private communications fitting within the exemption in Article 19(2) or to suspend international telecommunications are not prohibited. Additionally, the ITC does not specify the source or destination of the offending communications that may be cut off or suspended. Therefore, one may conclude it would be lawful to cut off or suspend communications completely within a foreign country or between locations in two foreign countries in certain circumstances, without the need for hostilities. However, cyber warfare operations that result in transmitting false or deceptive distress, urgency, safety or identification signals are unlawful, as is falsifying the identification of a transmitter and frequency. As a result, while a state may, under certain circumstances, block or suspend international communications, it may not lawfully spoof communications. However, there is ample precedent that provisions of international communication conventions are suspended between belligerents engaged in armed conflicts.³⁰⁸ ## C. International Aviation Law Cyber warfare operations involving the targeting of, or interference with, civilian aviation may implicate numerous international aviation laws. Such operations may involve disrupting an air traffic control tower, modifying a flight’s passenger list, or adding a name to a no-fly list. These types of operations have the potential to result in a delay or cancellation of flights, thereby interrupting travel plans of targeted belligerents.\n## 1. The Convention on International Civil Aviation The primary international law governing aviation is the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention.³⁰⁹ This Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized agency of the United Nations charged with coordinating and regulating international air travel. The Convention establishes rules of airspace, aircraft ³⁰⁷ *Id.* ³⁰⁸ See Dep’t of Defense General Counsel, *An Assessment of International Legal Issues in Information Operations* 33, available at http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dod-io-legal/dod-io-legal.pdf.\n³⁰⁹ Convention on International Civil Aviation, Chicago, Dec. 7, 1944, 15 U.N.T.S. 295, [hereinafter Chicago Convention].\n\nregistration, and safety.³¹⁰ The Convention is supported by eighteen annexes containing standards and recommended practices; these annexes are amended regularly by ICAO.³¹¹ Annex 17 sets out the basis for the ICAO civil aviation security program and seeks to safeguard civil aviation and its facilities against acts of unlawful interference.³¹² This Annex requires that each member state “have as its primary objective the safety of passengers, crew, ground personnel and the general public in all matters related to safeguarding against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation.”³¹³ A 1998 amendment to the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircraft.³¹⁴ Article 3 bis(a) specifically states that “the contracting States recognize that every State must refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight...”³¹⁵ Article 89 of the Chicago Convention allows a contracting state to disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency.\n[I]n case of war, the provisions of this Convention shall not affect the freedom of action of any of the contracting States affected, whether as belligerents or as neutrals. The same principle shall apply in the case of any contracting State which declares a state of national emergency and notifies the fact to the Council.³¹⁶ Cyber warfare operations targeting civilian aviation may run afoul of a state’s obligation under the Chicago Convention to safeguard against acts of unlawful interference with civil aviation. Additionally, if a cyber warfare operation targets an aircraft in flight, the operation very well may be a violation of the Article 3bis requirement to refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight.

MATERIAL 705 (1984)).\n³¹⁶ Chicago Convention, supra note 309, art. 89.\nCyber Warfare Operations 167 the Chicago Convention is unique in the fact that it specifically acknowledges that a state may lawfully disregard its obligations under the Convention in times of war or national emergency. This national emergency exception may provide some latitude in conducting cyber warfare operations in situations short of war.\n## 2. Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, commonly referred to as the Montreal Convention of 1971, makes specific conduct unlawful.³¹⁷ Article 1 provides that a person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally does or attempts to do any of the following: [1] performs an act of violence against a person on board an aircraft in flight if that act is likely to endanger the safety of that aircraft;³¹⁸ [2] destroys an aircraft in service or causes damage to such an aircraft which renders it incapable of flight or which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;³¹⁹ [3] places or causes to be placed on an aircraft in service, by any means whatsoever, a device or substance which is likely to destroy that aircraft, or to cause damage to it which renders it incapable of flight, or to cause damage to it which is likely to endanger its safety in flight;³²⁰ [4] destroys or damages air navigation facilities or interferes with their operation, if any such act is likely to endanger the safety of aircraft in flight;³²¹ or, [5] communicates information known to be false, thereby endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.³²² This Convention may limit the ability to conduct cyber warfare operations that interfere with an aircraft’s operating system, if such an operation would render the aircraft incapable of flight. Additionally, this Convention may also place a prohibition on interfering with the networks of air navigation facilities, as it essentially prohibits the ability to disrupt air traffic control communications or other aspects of air ³¹⁷ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Sept. 23, 1971, 24 U.S.T. 564 [hereinafter Montreal Convention].\n³¹⁸ Id. art. 1(1)(a).\n³¹⁹ Id. art. 1(1)(b).\n³²⁰ Id. art. 1(1)(c).\n³²¹ Id. art. 1(1)(d).\n³²² Id. art. 1(1)(e).\n\nnavigation, if it interferes with their operation and endangers the safety of an aircraft in flight. Finally, this Convention may prohibit cyber warfare operations from spoofing communication if it would endanger the safety of an aircraft. However, nothing in this Convention appears to limit cyber warfare operations that do not render a flight unable to fly or endanger the safety of an aircraft in flight.\n## 3. Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation The Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation³²³ supplemented and extended the legal framework of the Montreal Convention of 1971 to encompass unlawful acts of violence committed at airports serving international civil aviation, even where such acts do not endanger the safety of aircraft in flight. Article II sets forth the offenses covered by the Protocol. It states that any person commits an offense if he unlawfully and intentionally, using any device, substance, or weapon “performs an act of violence against a person at an airport serving international civil aviation which causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death”³²⁴ or “destroys or seriously damages the facilities of an airport serving international civil aviation or aircraft not in service located thereon or disrupts the services of the airport, if such an act endangers or is likely to endanger safety at that airport.”³²⁵ This Protocol has the potential to prohibit any cyber warfare operation that may impact service at an international airport, such as entering an airport’s computer network system and altering the passenger manifests or placing an individual on a no-fly list. To be unlawful, however, the cyber warfare operation would have to endanger the safety of those at the airport.\n## D. Arms Control Treaties Arms control treaties frequently contain prohibitions on interference and concealment in evading national technical means of verification.³²⁶ For example, the 1972 Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms Interim Agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union provided that “each Party undertakes not to interfere with the national technical means of verification of the other Party operating in ³²³ Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation, Feb. 24, 1988, 1589 U.N.T.S. 474 [hereinafter Montreal Protocol].\n³²⁴ Id. art. II, para 1..\n³²⁵ Id.\n³²⁶ Wingfield, supra note 18, at 330.\nCyber Warfare Operations 169 accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article.\"³²⁷ This agreement also provided that “each Party undertakes not to use deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the provisions of this Interim Agreement.”³²⁸ This became standard language in arms control treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union as evidenced by the language in Article XV of the 1979 Treaty on the Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and Protocol Thereto (SALT II), which states that “paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are adopted verbatim from the first two paragraphs of Article XII of the ABM Treaty and Article V of the Interim Agreement.”³²⁹ The third paragraph of this Article prohibits deliberate concealment measures which impede verification by national technical means of compliance with the Treaty.³³⁰ Arms control treaties that place a prohibition on interfering with the national technical means of a state may limit the ability of both states to conduct cyber warfare operations against the intelligence collecting capabilities of the other. However, arms control treaties, like other treaties except those defining laws of war, are suspended during war between parties.³³¹ Therefore, cyber warfare operations that interfere with military reconnaissance satellites used for arms control verification may violate the treaty. However, during hostilities these satellites would become a proper military objective.\n## E. Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime The Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime is the first international treaty on crimes committed via the internet and other computer networks.³³² The main objective of the Convention is to pursue a common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against cybercrime, especially by adopting appropriate legislation and fostering international cooperation.³³³ The U.S. ratified the Cybercrime Air Force Law Review • Volume 64 Convention in 2006. This Convention covers a broad range of criminal conduct broken up into four categories: offenses against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer data and systems; computer-related offenses; content-related offenses; and offenses related to infringements of copyright and related rights. \nCyber Warfare Operations would most likely run afoul of the offenses described within the first category, in particular Articles 2 through 5, which relate to illegal access, illegal interception, data interference, and system interference, respectively. However, its rules do not apply to government activities, whether for law enforcement or national security purposes. For example, Article 2 requires states to adopt “legislative and other measures” to establish as criminal offenses under their domestic law intentional “access to the whole or any part of a computer system without right.” The accompanying Explanatory Report clarifies that the “without right” caveat “leaves unaffected conduct undertaken pursuant to lawful government authority,” including acts to “protect national security or investigate criminal offences.” Nevertheless, this Convention still poses potential problems for conducting cyber warfare operations. For example, parties to the Convention have agreed to, among other things, “co-operate with each other... to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations or proceedings concerning criminal offences related to computer systems and data, or for the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.” This may create issues for a signatory state that wishes to conduct cyber warfare operations against another signatory state. For example, if particular actions such as breaching security measures or intercepting electronic messages of a signatory state are traced back to the state conducting the cyber warfare operations, then that state’s duty to assist is not plausible if it is denying liability for the attacks.\nCyber Warfare Operations 171 Air Force Law Review • Volume 64 # IX. CONCLUSION Nothing in international law explicitly prohibits cyber warfare operations. However, legal limitations surely exist with regard to their application. Also, cyber warfare operations have the potential of constituting a use of force or a violation under the law of war.\nCyber warfare operations offer a variety of methods to impact an adversary's ability to conduct war. They may enable a state to infiltrate an adversary's network, acquire files, spread misinformation, or introduce weaknesses into an adversary's systems. Cyber warfare operations may also make it possible for a state to take control of an adversary's network for the purpose of temporarily or permanently disabling it or affecting the infrastructure it supports.³⁴⁴ Additionally, cyber warfare operations have the potential of depriving an adversary of essential infrastructure that supports military actions, such as communication satellites. One advantage of cyber warfare operations is that they will often achieve their desired results with less collateral damage than traditional warfare, such as, disabling an electrical grid by accessing its network in lieu of bombing the power plant.³⁴⁵ Despite the fact that cyber warfare operations have the potential of limiting collateral damage during times of hostilities, they pose several risks to states that may employ such warfare. One example would be the potential escalation of minor hostilities into a full blown armed conflict. For example, State A, having received specific evidence establishing that State B was behind DoS attacks against State A's government, declares the acts an unlawful use of force and orders an aerial bombing campaign against State B's communication facilities, the source of the attack. State B may in turn declare the acts of State A as acts of war and launch missiles into State A. In this scenario who is to blame? Did anyone actually violate international law?\nOne of the greatest challenges of law is keeping up with the advancement of technology.³⁴⁶ The international community has often struggled to implement standards of conduct in a timely manner regarding the advancement of weaponry.³⁴⁷ In the past, when new technologies emerged, in an effort to avoid war or minimize human suffering when conflicts occur, states drafted rules resulting in, for example, treaties restricting biological, chemical, and laser weapons.³⁴⁸ In March 2006, Nikolai Kuryanovich, a member of the Russian Duma, noted in a letter to an ultranationalist hacker group known as the Slavic Union that, “In the very near future many conflicts will not take place ³⁴⁴ See Hollis, supra note 340, at 1031.\n³⁴⁵ Id. at 1032.\n³⁴⁶ Brown, supra note 227, at 179.\n³⁴⁷ Id.\n³⁴⁸ Id.\non the open field of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet, fought with the aid of information soldiers....\"349 I contend that the future Mr. Kuryanovich discusses is now, and that now is the time for states to determine what is and is not permitted under international law in relation to cyber warfare operations. Failure to do so now may result in overly restrictive, reactionary regulations in response to a cyber Pearl Harbor-like attack, rather than a well thought out, proactive, structured approach.\nCyber Warfare Operations 173"
