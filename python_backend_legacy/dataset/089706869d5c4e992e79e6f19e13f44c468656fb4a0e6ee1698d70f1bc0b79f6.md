Introduction\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with.¹ Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons,² there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade.³ Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.⁴\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n1 The World Economic Forum in 2013 identified the rapid dissemination of disinformation, i.e. the dissemination of deliberately false or misleading information to deceive the public and thereby cause public harm, as one of the most important trends in society.

This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation\nWhether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n5 Michael N.

If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes».¹³ Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors.¹⁴ The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD¹⁵, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.¹⁶\n10 RICHARD GUNTHER et al., «Fake News May Have Contributed to Trump's 2016 Victory», Ohio State University, 2018, available at: <https: 3ai7w9l=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n11 DAVID P.

Do CISDOs violate international law?\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State»¹⁷ and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law»¹⁸ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter.¹⁹ Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions²⁰ and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ²¹. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State».²² The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.²³\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n17 PHILIP KUNIG, «Intervention, Prohibition of», Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, <https: 3uukhiz=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 7.\n18 ICJ, Nicaragua v.

Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.²⁵\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way.²⁶ The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage.²⁷ As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage.²⁸ Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force.²⁹ When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value.³⁰ Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n24 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 315.\n25 UNODA, «The Kingdom of the Netherlands' Response to the Pre-draft Report of the OEWG», Open-ended Working Group, 2020, <https: 3kdriut=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 18.\n26 Tallinn Manual 2.0: «[Rule 66] prohibits coercive intervention, including by cyber means, by one State into the internal or external affairs of another.» SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 312 (emphasis mine); Jammejad and Wood argue that «if the pressure is such that it could be reasonably resisted, the sovereign will of the target state has not been subordinated».

However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment.³¹ In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.³²\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way».³³ However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.³⁴\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated.³⁵ Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence,³⁶ the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl-\n³¹ CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message.³⁹ If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.⁴⁰\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention.⁴¹ In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality.⁴² However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.⁴³\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will.⁴⁴ Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n37 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n38 MICHAEL SCHMITT, «Virtual Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law», 19 Chicago Journal of International Law (2018), 32–67, at 51.\n39 DEREK HAWKINS, «No, you can’t text your vote.

The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.⁴⁵\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty.⁴⁶ Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law,⁴⁷ the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law.⁴⁸ However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently».⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty.⁵⁰ While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State».⁵¹ While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections⁵² – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n⁴⁵ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n⁴⁶ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n⁴⁷ DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n⁴⁸ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁴⁹ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n⁵⁰ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁵¹ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n⁵² Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function». SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 45.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nlation of sovereignty. However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.⁵³\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),⁵⁴, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding».⁵⁵ Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War,⁵⁶ the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified»⁵⁷. It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State\n⁵³ SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n⁵⁴ International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc.

Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nparty to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it.[58] Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine[59], the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State.[60] However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention).[61] The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n58 United Nations Treaty Collection, «International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace: Ratifications or definitive accessions», <https: 3wuktyu=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n59 TALITA DE SOUZA DIAS, «Russia's <genocide disinformation=\"\"> and war propaganda are breaches of the International Convention Concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace and fall within the ICJ's jurisdiction», EJIL: Talk!, 4 March 2022, <https: 3wnm0ik=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n60 BJÖRNSTJERN BAADE, «Fake News and International Law», 29 European Journal of International Law (2018), 1357–1376, at 1369.\n61 Convention on the International Right of Correction, adopted on 16 December 1952, UN Doc.

Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.[63]\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs,[64] the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well.⁶⁵ The IGE has come to the same conclusion.⁶⁶\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).⁶⁷ Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation⁶⁸, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration.⁶⁹ In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR⁷⁰. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.⁷¹\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated.⁷² Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro\n65 See for example Resolutions A/HRC/RES/38/7 (5 July 2018), A/HRC/RES/32/13 (1 July 2016), A/HRC/RES/26/13 (26 June 2014), A/HRC/RES/20/8 (5 July 2012).\n66 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 196.\n67 DAVID KAYE, «Disease pandemics and the freedom of opinion and expression», Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 23 April 2020, UN Doc.

General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine).[74] Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control.[75] Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region.[76] Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States.[77] Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned.

International humanitarian law\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^[78]^\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^[79]^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^[80]^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^[81]^\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^[82]^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^[83]^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n^[78]^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^[79]^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury.[86] Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.[87]\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n84 Art. 51(2) API: «[...] Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.» To qualify as terror, the disinformation would have to qualify as an attack or threat thereof. Acts which result in mental injury («severe mental suffering») can be classified as an attack.\n85 See EIAN KATZ, «Liar's War: Protecting Civilians from Disinformation during Armed Conflict», 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), 659-682, at 668.\n86 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 491.\n87 ICRC, supra n. 80, para. 1493.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ngenocide tragically demonstrated.⁸⁸ Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL.⁸⁹ According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL.⁹⁰ Relevant provisions of IHRL⁹¹ – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.⁹²\n## IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc.

However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n⁹² KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n⁹³ See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n⁹⁴ KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n⁹⁵ Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34.

The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n99 UN Commission on Human Rights, «The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights», 28 September 1984, UN Doc.

Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.[105] Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.[106] Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression».[107] The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].[108]\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n105 SHAUN WALKER &amp; JENNIFER RANKIN, «Hungary passes law that will let Orbán rule by decree», The Guardian, 30 March 2020, available at: <https: 3pttt7f=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n106 Human Rights Watch, «Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse», 11 February 2021, <https: 3ddfxlk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n107 UN Human Rights Committee, 19th Annual Report, October 1995, UN Doc.

CCPR/C/79/Add.116, para. 24, emphasis mine.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:></https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nprotecting a «legitimate public interest».¹⁰⁹ Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl.

Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies.¹¹⁴ As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State».¹¹⁵ The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether.¹¹⁶ This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN.

As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States¹²² signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n118 Several member states of NATO and the EU in 2017 conjointly established the «European Centre of Excellence (CoE) against Hybrid Threats» in order to improve EU-NATO cooperation in the fight against disinformation.

How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n¹²³ Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n¹²⁴ HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation.[127] Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n127 ZHAO, supra n. 36, at 51.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\n^{}[]",

Introduction\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with. Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons, there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade. Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nereign States, for ways to regulate and counter CISDOs. This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation\nWhether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n\nYannick Zerbe\nsocio-economic cleavages in society and can thereby, for example, influence electoral processes, disrupt the response to a public health crisis or augment the confusion created by the fog of war. If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes». Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors. The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n## III. Do CISDOs violate international law?\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State» and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law» by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter. Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State». The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n\nYannick Zerbe\ntion and system lies at the heart of sovereignty and thus squarely falls in its domaine réservé. Likewise, the security and integrity of a State – jeopardized for example in the case of Russia's genocide disinformation in Ukraine – indisputably also qualifies. Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way. The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage. As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage. Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force. When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value. Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nuse of force under international law. However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment. In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way». However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated. Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence, the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl-\n CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

Davis Journal of International Law &amp; Policy (2020), 35–80, at 57.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nedge of such an operation does not preclude the breach of the principle of non-intervention. However, some causal nexus will have to be proven between the act of the disinforming State and the desired or attained outcome, which is inherently difficult. To prove a coercive effect behind CISDOs is further complicated by the fact that they often do not aim to produce a specific outcome, but intend to create a general atmosphere of confusion, distrust or discontent.\nThere are occasions, however, where such a causal nexus can be established more easily. For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message. If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention. In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality. However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will. Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nwould constitute an internationally wrongful act, simply if it had the intent to coerce. The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty. Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law, the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law. However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently». The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty. While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State». While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function».

However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding». Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War, the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified». It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State\n SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc.

Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nparty to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it.[58] Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine[59], the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State.[60] However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention).[61] The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n\nYannick Zerbe\ntomary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing, corrections of such dispatches.[62]\nWhile the terms «correspondent» and «information agency» were defined more broadly in the Correction Convention, it is debatable whether State-sponsored «trolls» can be described as correspondents and the IRA as an information agency. Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.[63]\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs,[64] the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well. The IGE has come to the same conclusion.\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration. In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated. Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro\n\nYannick Zerbe\ncess to develop an opinion» are a violation of that right.[73] It seems clear that modern technology allows CISDOs to manipulate users efficiently and at scale.\nIn this regard, disinformation that violates art. 19(1) ICCPR may simultaneously amount to a breach of art. 25 ICCPR, which proclaims the right to free and fair elections. General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine).[74] Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control.[75] Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region.[76] Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States.[77] Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned. To what degree Russia has negative obligations to\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nabstain from violating the human rights of the population of Germany remains controversial.\n## D. International humanitarian law\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^[78]^\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^[79]^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^[80]^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^[81]^\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^[82]^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^[83]^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n^[78]^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^[79]^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury.[86] Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.[87]\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ngenocide tragically demonstrated. Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL. According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL. Relevant provisions of IHRL – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.\n## IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments. Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right. However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc. A/HRC/39/CRP.2, para. 1324.\n KNUT DÖRMANN &amp; JOSE SERRALVO, «Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions and the Obligation to Prevent International Humanitarian Law Violations», 96 International Review of the Red Cross (2014), 707–736.\n IHRL generally applies both in peacetime and during armed conflict. However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda. When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda».\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34. The ECtHR has developed a similar test of its own. ECtHR, «Guide on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights», 30 April 2021, 19–24, <https: 3q4hogk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n See for example LINDA MONSEES, «<a against=\"\" war=\"\" truth=\"\"> – Understanding the Fake News Controversy», 8 Critical Studies on Security (2020), 116–29.\n Art. 20(1) ICCPR: «Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law».\n VALENTINA POP, «The painful birth of EU’s latest sanctions», Financial Times, 2 March 2022, <https: 3ufolkq=\"\" on.ft.com=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter Syracuse Principles). The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n\nYannick Zerbe\nleast the two first conditions. Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.[105] Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.[106] Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression».[107] The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].[108]\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nprotecting a «legitimate public interest». Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas. I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts. The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format. The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl. No. 12/1984/84/131, para. 46.\n ECJ, Baltic Media Alliance v. Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies. As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State». The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether. This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end. Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n Id., para. 79.\n See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nalso been spearheaded by NATO and the G7. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN. Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ». While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n\nYannick Zerbe\ncondemn, prevent and fight such actions». Furthermore, on 1 April 2022, the UN Human Rights Council adopted – by consensus – resolution 49/21 on the «[r]ole of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights». Therein, the Council, «[c]oncerned by the increasing and far-reaching negative impact on the enjoyment and realization of human rights» of disinformation, called upon States to «refrain from conducting or sponsoring disinformation campaigns domestically or transnationally for political or other purposes, and encourages them to condemn such acts». Finally, UNSG Antonio Guterres in his latest report on «Our Common Agenda» called for a «global code of conduct that promotes integrity in public information» to be established conjointly by member states, regulatory bodies and media outlets under the auspices of the UN. All of the aforementioned documents are legally non-binding but nonetheless constitute important evidence of emerging soft law on which new regulation may be based.\n## V. How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation.[127] Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n\n^{}[]",

    "I. Introduction": "In what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with.¹ Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons,² there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade.³ Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.⁴\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n1 The World Economic Forum in 2013 identified the rapid dissemination of disinformation, i.e. the dissemination of deliberately false or misleading information to deceive the public and thereby cause public harm, as one of the most important trends in society.

This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.",
    "II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation": "Whether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n5 Michael N.

If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes».¹³ Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors.¹⁴ The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD¹⁵, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.¹⁶\n10 RICHARD GUNTHER et al., «Fake News May Have Contributed to Trump's 2016 Victory», Ohio State University, 2018, available at: <https: 3ai7w9l=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n11 DAVID P.

    "III. Do CISDOs violate international law?": "### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State»¹⁷ and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law»¹⁸ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter.¹⁹ Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions²⁰ and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ²¹. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State».²² The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.²³\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n17 PHILIP KUNIG, «Intervention, Prohibition of», Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, <https: 3uukhiz=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 7.\n18 ICJ, Nicaragua v.

A/RES/2625(XXV) (emphasis added). The ICJ has stated that the provisions contained in this resolution constitute customary international law.

Uganda), Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Rep 168, para. 155-65.\n23 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 312.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\ntion and system lies at the heart of sovereignty and thus squarely falls in its domaine réservé.²⁴ Likewise, the security and integrity of a State – jeopardized for example in the case of Russia's genocide disinformation in Ukraine – indisputably also qualifies. Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.²⁵\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way.²⁶ The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage.²⁷ As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage.²⁸ Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force.²⁹ When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value.³⁰ Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n24 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 315.\n25 UNODA, «The Kingdom of the Netherlands' Response to the Pre-draft Report of the OEWG», Open-ended Working Group, 2020, <https: 3kdriut=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 18.\n26 Tallinn Manual 2.0: «[Rule 66] prohibits coercive intervention, including by cyber means, by one State into the internal or external affairs of another.» SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 312 (emphasis mine); Jammejad and Wood argue that «if the pressure is such that it could be reasonably resisted, the sovereign will of the target state has not been subordinated».

However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment.³¹ In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.³²\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way».³³ However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.³⁴\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated.³⁵ Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence,³⁶ the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl-\n³¹ CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message.³⁹ If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.⁴⁰\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention.⁴¹ In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality.⁴² However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.⁴³\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will.⁴⁴ Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n37 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n38 MICHAEL SCHMITT, «Virtual Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law», 19 Chicago Journal of International Law (2018), 32–67, at 51.\n39 DEREK HAWKINS, «No, you can’t text your vote.

The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.⁴⁵\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty.⁴⁶ Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law,⁴⁷ the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law.⁴⁸ However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently».⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty.⁵⁰ While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State».⁵¹ While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections⁵² – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n⁴⁵ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n⁴⁶ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n⁴⁷ DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n⁴⁸ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁴⁹ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n⁵⁰ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁵¹ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n⁵² Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function».

However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.⁵³\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),⁵⁴, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding».⁵⁵ Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War,⁵⁶ the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified»⁵⁷. It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State\n⁵³ SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n⁵⁴ International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc. A/RES/841.\n⁵⁵ See the Convention’s preamble and operational provisions.\n⁵⁶ JOHN B. WHITTON, «War by Radio», Foreign Affairs, April 1941, <https: 3hehqmq=\"\" fam.ag=\"\">.\n⁵⁷ See art. 4 of the Convention (emphasis mine). Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nparty to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it. Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine, the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State. However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention). The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n58 United Nations Treaty Collection, «International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace: Ratifications or definitive accessions», <https: 3wuktyu=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n59 TALITA DE SOUZA DIAS, «Russia's <genocide disinformation=\"\"> and war propaganda are breaches of the International Convention Concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace and fall within the ICJ's jurisdiction», EJIL: Talk!, 4 March 2022, <https: 3wnm0ik=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n60 BJÖRNSTJERN BAADE, «Fake News and International Law», 29 European Journal of International Law (2018), 1357–1376, at 1369.\n61 Convention on the International Right of Correction, adopted on 16 December 1952, UN Doc. A/ RES/630(VII).\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:></genocide></https:>\nYannick Zerbe\ntomary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing, corrections of such dispatches.\nWhile the terms «correspondent» and «information agency» were defined more broadly in the Correction Convention, it is debatable whether State-sponsored «trolls» can be described as correspondents and the IRA as an information agency. Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs, the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well.⁶⁵ The IGE has come to the same conclusion.⁶⁶\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).⁶⁷ Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation⁶⁸, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration.⁶⁹ In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR⁷⁰. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.⁷¹\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated.⁷² Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro\n65 See for example Resolutions A/HRC/RES/38/7 (5 July 2018), A/HRC/RES/32/13 (1 July 2016), A/HRC/RES/26/13 (26 June 2014), A/HRC/RES/20/8 (5 July 2012).\n66 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 196.\n67 DAVID KAYE, «Disease pandemics and the freedom of opinion and expression», Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 23 April 2020, UN Doc.

Failure to comply with these obligations under article 20, may also constitute a failure to take the necessary measures to protect the right to life under article 6.» Human Rights Committee, «General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to life», adopted by the Committee at its 124th session (8 October to 2 November 2018), UN Doc.

It seems clear that modern technology allows CISDOs to manipulate users efficiently and at scale.\nIn this regard, disinformation that violates art. 19(1) ICCPR may simultaneously amount to a breach of art. 25 ICCPR, which proclaims the right to free and fair elections. General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine). Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control. Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region. Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States. Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned. To what degree Russia has negative obligations to\n73 IRENE KHAN, «In my view: To tackle disinformation, we must uphold freedom of opinion and expression», in: OECD, Development Co-operation Report 2021: Shaping a Just Digital Transformation, Paris 2021, para. 36.\n74 UN Human Rights Committee, «CCPR General Comment No. 25: Article 25 (Participation in Public Affairs and the Right to Vote), The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service», 12 July 1996, UN Doc.

International humanitarian law\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^^\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^^\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n^^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury. Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n84 Art. 51(2) API: «[...] Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.» To qualify as terror, the disinformation would have to qualify as an attack or threat thereof. Acts which result in mental injury («severe mental suffering») can be classified as an attack.\n85 See EIAN KATZ, «Liar's War: Protecting Civilians from Disinformation during Armed Conflict», 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), 659-682, at 668.\n86 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 491.\n87 ICRC, supra n. 80, para. 1493.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ngenocide tragically demonstrated.⁸⁸ Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL.⁸⁹ According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL.⁹⁰ Relevant provisions of IHRL⁹¹ – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.⁹²",
    "IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?": "### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc.

However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n⁹² KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n⁹³ See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n⁹⁴ KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n⁹⁵ Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34.

The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n99 UN Commission on Human Rights, «The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights», 28 September 1984, UN Doc.

Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression». The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n105 SHAUN WALKER &amp; JENNIFER RANKIN, «Hungary passes law that will let Orbán rule by decree», The Guardian, 30 March 2020, available at: <https: 3pttt7f=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n106 Human Rights Watch, «Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse», 11 February 2021, <https: 3ddfxlk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n107 UN Human Rights Committee, 19th Annual Report, October 1995, UN Doc.

Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl.

Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies.¹¹⁴ As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State».¹¹⁵ The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether.¹¹⁶ This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.¹¹⁷ Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n¹¹⁴ Id., para. 79.\n¹¹⁵ See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n¹¹⁶ *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n¹¹⁷ See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nalso been spearheaded by NATO¹¹⁸ and the G7¹¹⁹. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States¹²² signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n118 Several member states of NATO and the EU in 2017 conjointly established the «European Centre of Excellence (CoE) against Hybrid Threats» in order to improve EU-NATO cooperation in the fight against disinformation. NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence also supports the alliance's countermeasures against disinformation.

How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n¹²³ Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n¹²⁴ HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation. Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n127 ZHAO, supra n. 36, at 51.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\n^{}[]",
    "__postscript__": "### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc.

However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n⁹² KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n⁹³ See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n⁹⁴ KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n⁹⁵ Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34. The ECtHR has developed a similar test of its own.

The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n99 UN Commission on Human Rights, «The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights», 28 September 1984, UN Doc.

Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression». The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n105 SHAUN WALKER &amp; JENNIFER RANKIN, «Hungary passes law that will let Orbán rule by decree», The Guardian, 30 March 2020, available at: <https: 3pttt7f=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n106 Human Rights Watch, «Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse», 11 February 2021, <https: 3ddfxlk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n107 UN Human Rights Committee, 19th Annual Report, October 1995, UN Doc.

Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl.

Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies.¹¹⁴ As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State».¹¹⁵ The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether.¹¹⁶ This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.¹¹⁷ Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n¹¹⁴ Id., para. 79.\n¹¹⁵ See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n¹¹⁶ *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n¹¹⁷ See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nalso been spearheaded by NATO¹¹⁸ and the G7¹¹⁹. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States¹²² signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n118 Several member states of NATO and the EU in 2017 conjointly established the «European Centre of Excellence (CoE) against Hybrid Threats» in order to improve EU-NATO cooperation in the fight against disinformation. NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence also supports the alliance's countermeasures against disinformation.

How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n¹²³ Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n¹²⁴ HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation. Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n127 ZHAO, supra n. 36, at 51.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\n^{}[]"

Introduction\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with. Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons, there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade. Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nereign States, for ways to regulate and counter CISDOs. This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation\nWhether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n\nYannick Zerbe\nsocio-economic cleavages in society and can thereby, for example, influence electoral processes, disrupt the response to a public health crisis or augment the confusion created by the fog of war. If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes». Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors. The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n## III. Do CISDOs violate international law?\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State» and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law» by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter. Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State». The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n\nYannick Zerbe\ntion and system lies at the heart of sovereignty and thus squarely falls in its domaine réservé. Likewise, the security and integrity of a State – jeopardized for example in the case of Russia's genocide disinformation in Ukraine – indisputably also qualifies. Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way. The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage. As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage. Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force. When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value. Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nuse of force under international law. However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment. In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way». However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated. Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence, the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl-\n CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

Davis Journal of International Law &amp; Policy (2020), 35–80, at 57.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nedge of such an operation does not preclude the breach of the principle of non-intervention. However, some causal nexus will have to be proven between the act of the disinforming State and the desired or attained outcome, which is inherently difficult. To prove a coercive effect behind CISDOs is further complicated by the fact that they often do not aim to produce a specific outcome, but intend to create a general atmosphere of confusion, distrust or discontent.\nThere are occasions, however, where such a causal nexus can be established more easily. For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message. If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention. In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality. However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will. Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nwould constitute an internationally wrongful act, simply if it had the intent to coerce. The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty. Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law, the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law. However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently». The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty. While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State». While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function».

However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding». Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War, the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified». It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State\n SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc. A/RES/841.\n See the Convention’s preamble and operational provisions.\n JOHN B. WHITTON, «War by Radio», Foreign Affairs, April 1941, <https: 3hehqmq=\"\" fam.ag=\"\">.\n See art. 4 of the Convention (emphasis mine). Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nparty to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it.[58] Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine[59], the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State.[60] However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention).[61] The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n\nYannick Zerbe\ntomary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing, corrections of such dispatches.[62]\nWhile the terms «correspondent» and «information agency» were defined more broadly in the Correction Convention, it is debatable whether State-sponsored «trolls» can be described as correspondents and the IRA as an information agency. Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.[63]\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs,[64] the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well. The IGE has come to the same conclusion.\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration. In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated. Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro\n\nYannick Zerbe\ncess to develop an opinion» are a violation of that right.[73] It seems clear that modern technology allows CISDOs to manipulate users efficiently and at scale.\nIn this regard, disinformation that violates art. 19(1) ICCPR may simultaneously amount to a breach of art. 25 ICCPR, which proclaims the right to free and fair elections. General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine).[74] Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control.[75] Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region.[76] Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States.[77] Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned. To what degree Russia has negative obligations to\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nabstain from violating the human rights of the population of Germany remains controversial.\n## D. International humanitarian law\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^[78]^\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^[79]^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^[80]^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^[81]^\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^[82]^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^[83]^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n^[78]^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^[79]^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury.[86] Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.[87]\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ngenocide tragically demonstrated. Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL. According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL. Relevant provisions of IHRL – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.\n## IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments. Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right. However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc. A/HRC/39/CRP.2, para. 1324.\n KNUT DÖRMANN &amp; JOSE SERRALVO, «Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions and the Obligation to Prevent International Humanitarian Law Violations», 96 International Review of the Red Cross (2014), 707–736.\n IHRL generally applies both in peacetime and during armed conflict. However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda. When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda».\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34. The ECtHR has developed a similar test of its own. ECtHR, «Guide on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights», 30 April 2021, 19–24, <https: 3q4hogk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n See for example LINDA MONSEES, «<a against=\"\" war=\"\" truth=\"\"> – Understanding the Fake News Controversy», 8 Critical Studies on Security (2020), 116–29.\n Art. 20(1) ICCPR: «Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law».\n VALENTINA POP, «The painful birth of EU’s latest sanctions», Financial Times, 2 March 2022, <https: 3ufolkq=\"\" on.ft.com=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter Syracuse Principles). The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n\nYannick Zerbe\nleast the two first conditions. Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.[105] Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.[106] Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression».[107] The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].[108]\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nprotecting a «legitimate public interest». Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas. I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts. The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format. The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl. No. 12/1984/84/131, para. 46.\n ECJ, Baltic Media Alliance v. Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies. As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State». The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether. This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.

As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN. Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ». While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n\nYannick Zerbe\ncondemn, prevent and fight such actions». Furthermore, on 1 April 2022, the UN Human Rights Council adopted – by consensus – resolution 49/21 on the «[r]ole of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights». Therein, the Council, «[c]oncerned by the increasing and far-reaching negative impact on the enjoyment and realization of human rights» of disinformation, called upon States to «refrain from conducting or sponsoring disinformation campaigns domestically or transnationally for political or other purposes, and encourages them to condemn such acts». Finally, UNSG Antonio Guterres in his latest report on «Our Common Agenda» called for a «global code of conduct that promotes integrity in public information» to be established conjointly by member states, regulatory bodies and media outlets under the auspices of the UN. All of the aforementioned documents are legally non-binding but nonetheless constitute important evidence of emerging soft law on which new regulation may be based.\n## V. How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation.[127] Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n\n^{}[]",

Introduction\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with. Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons, there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade. Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nereign States, for ways to regulate and counter CISDOs. This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation\nWhether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n\nYannick Zerbe\nsocio-economic cleavages in society and can thereby, for example, influence electoral processes, disrupt the response to a public health crisis or augment the confusion created by the fog of war. If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes». Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors. The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n## III. Do CISDOs violate international law?\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State» and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law» by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter. Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State». The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n\nYannick Zerbe\ntion and system lies at the heart of sovereignty and thus squarely falls in its domaine réservé. Likewise, the security and integrity of a State – jeopardized for example in the case of Russia's genocide disinformation in Ukraine – indisputably also qualifies. Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way. The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage. As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage. Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force. When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value. Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nuse of force under international law. However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment. In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way». However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated. Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence, the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl-\n CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

Davis Journal of International Law &amp; Policy (2020), 35–80, at 57.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nedge of such an operation does not preclude the breach of the principle of non-intervention. However, some causal nexus will have to be proven between the act of the disinforming State and the desired or attained outcome, which is inherently difficult. To prove a coercive effect behind CISDOs is further complicated by the fact that they often do not aim to produce a specific outcome, but intend to create a general atmosphere of confusion, distrust or discontent.\nThere are occasions, however, where such a causal nexus can be established more easily. For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message. If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention. In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality. However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will. Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nwould constitute an internationally wrongful act, simply if it had the intent to coerce. The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty. Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law, the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law. However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently». The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty. While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State». While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function». SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 45.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nlation of sovereignty. However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding». Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War, the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified». It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State\n SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc. A/RES/841.\n See the Convention’s preamble and operational provisions.\n JOHN B. WHITTON, «War by Radio», Foreign Affairs, April 1941, <https: 3hehqmq=\"\" fam.ag=\"\">.\n See art. 4 of the Convention (emphasis mine). Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nparty to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it.[58] Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine[59], the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State.[60] However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention).[61] The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n\nYannick Zerbe\ntomary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing, corrections of such dispatches.[62]\nWhile the terms «correspondent» and «information agency» were defined more broadly in the Correction Convention, it is debatable whether State-sponsored «trolls» can be described as correspondents and the IRA as an information agency. Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.[63]\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs,[64] the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well. The IGE has come to the same conclusion.\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration. In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated. Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro\n\nYannick Zerbe\ncess to develop an opinion» are a violation of that right.[73] It seems clear that modern technology allows CISDOs to manipulate users efficiently and at scale.\nIn this regard, disinformation that violates art. 19(1) ICCPR may simultaneously amount to a breach of art. 25 ICCPR, which proclaims the right to free and fair elections. General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine).[74] Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control.[75] Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region.[76] Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States.[77] Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned. To what degree Russia has negative obligations to\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nabstain from violating the human rights of the population of Germany remains controversial.\n## D. International humanitarian law\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^[78]^\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^[79]^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^[80]^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^[81]^\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^[82]^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^[83]^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n^[78]^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^[79]^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury.[86] Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.[87]\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ngenocide tragically demonstrated. Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL. According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL. Relevant provisions of IHRL – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.\n## IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments. Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right. However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc. A/HRC/39/CRP.2, para. 1324.\n KNUT DÖRMANN &amp; JOSE SERRALVO, «Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions and the Obligation to Prevent International Humanitarian Law Violations», 96 International Review of the Red Cross (2014), 707–736.\n IHRL generally applies both in peacetime and during armed conflict. However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda. When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda».\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34. The ECtHR has developed a similar test of its own. ECtHR, «Guide on Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights», 30 April 2021, 19–24, <https: 3q4hogk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n See for example LINDA MONSEES, «<a against=\"\" war=\"\" truth=\"\"> – Understanding the Fake News Controversy», 8 Critical Studies on Security (2020), 116–29.\n Art. 20(1) ICCPR: «Any propaganda for war shall be prohibited by law».\n VALENTINA POP, «The painful birth of EU’s latest sanctions», Financial Times, 2 March 2022, <https: 3ufolkq=\"\" on.ft.com=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (hereinafter Syracuse Principles). The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n\nYannick Zerbe\nleast the two first conditions. Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.[105] Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.[106] Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression».[107] The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].[108]\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nprotecting a «legitimate public interest». Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas. I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts. The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format. The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl. No. 12/1984/84/131, para. 46.\n ECJ, Baltic Media Alliance v. Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies. As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State». The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether. This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end. Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n Id., para. 79.\n See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nalso been spearheaded by NATO and the G7. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN. Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ». While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n\nYannick Zerbe\ncondemn, prevent and fight such actions». Furthermore, on 1 April 2022, the UN Human Rights Council adopted – by consensus – resolution 49/21 on the «[r]ole of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights». Therein, the Council, «[c]oncerned by the increasing and far-reaching negative impact on the enjoyment and realization of human rights» of disinformation, called upon States to «refrain from conducting or sponsoring disinformation campaigns domestically or transnationally for political or other purposes, and encourages them to condemn such acts». Finally, UNSG Antonio Guterres in his latest report on «Our Common Agenda» called for a «global code of conduct that promotes integrity in public information» to be established conjointly by member states, regulatory bodies and media outlets under the auspices of the UN. All of the aforementioned documents are legally non-binding but nonetheless constitute important evidence of emerging soft law on which new regulation may be based.\n## V. How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation.[127] Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n\n^{}[]"

Introduction\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with.¹ Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons,² there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade.³ Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.⁴\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n1 The World Economic Forum in 2013 identified the rapid dissemination of disinformation, i.e. the dissemination of deliberately false or misleading information to deceive the public and thereby cause public harm, as one of the most important trends in society.

This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation\nWhether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n5 Michael N.

If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes».¹³ Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors.¹⁴ The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD¹⁵, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.¹⁶\n10 RICHARD GUNTHER et al., «Fake News May Have Contributed to Trump's 2016 Victory», Ohio State University, 2018, available at: <https: 3ai7w9l=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n11 DAVID P.

Do CISDOs violate international law?\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State»¹⁷ and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law»¹⁸ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter.¹⁹ Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions²⁰ and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ²¹. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State».²² The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.²³\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n17 PHILIP KUNIG, «Intervention, Prohibition of», Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, <https: 3uukhiz=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 7.\n18 ICJ, Nicaragua v.

A/RES/2625(XXV) (emphasis added). The ICJ has stated that the provisions contained in this resolution constitute customary international law.

Uganda), Judgment of 19 December 2005, ICJ Rep 168, para. 155-65.\n23 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 312.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\ntion and system lies at the heart of sovereignty and thus squarely falls in its domaine réservé.²⁴ Likewise, the security and integrity of a State – jeopardized for example in the case of Russia's genocide disinformation in Ukraine – indisputably also qualifies. Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.²⁵\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way.²⁶ The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage.²⁷ As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage.²⁸ Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force.²⁹ When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value.³⁰ Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n24 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 315.\n25 UNODA, «The Kingdom of the Netherlands' Response to the Pre-draft Report of the OEWG», Open-ended Working Group, 2020, <https: 3kdriut=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 18.\n26 Tallinn Manual 2.0: «[Rule 66] prohibits coercive intervention, including by cyber means, by one State into the internal or external affairs of another.» SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 312 (emphasis mine); Jammejad and Wood argue that «if the pressure is such that it could be reasonably resisted, the sovereign will of the target state has not been subordinated».

However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment.³¹ In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.³²\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way».³³ However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.³⁴\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated.³⁵ Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect.

For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message.³⁹ If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.⁴⁰\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention.⁴¹ In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality.⁴² However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.⁴³\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will.⁴⁴ Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n37 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n38 MICHAEL SCHMITT, «Virtual Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law», 19 Chicago Journal of International Law (2018), 32–67, at 51.\n39 DEREK HAWKINS, «No, you can’t text your vote.

The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.⁴⁵\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty.⁴⁶ Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law,⁴⁷ the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law.⁴⁸ However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently».⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty.⁵⁰ While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State».⁵¹ While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections⁵² – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n⁴⁵ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n⁴⁶ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n⁴⁷ DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n⁴⁸ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁴⁹ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n⁵⁰ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁵¹ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n⁵² Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function».

However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.⁵³\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),⁵⁴, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding».⁵⁵ Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War,⁵⁶ the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified»⁵⁷. It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State\n⁵³ SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n⁵⁴ International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc. A/RES/841.\n⁵⁵ See the Convention’s preamble and operational provisions.\n⁵⁶ JOHN B. WHITTON, «War by Radio», Foreign Affairs, April 1941, <https: 3hehqmq=\"\" fam.ag=\"\">.\n⁵⁷ See art. 4 of the Convention (emphasis mine). Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nparty to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it. Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine, the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State. However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention). The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n58 United Nations Treaty Collection, «International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace: Ratifications or definitive accessions», <https: 3wuktyu=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n59 TALITA DE SOUZA DIAS, «Russia's <genocide disinformation=\"\"> and war propaganda are breaches of the International Convention Concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace and fall within the ICJ's jurisdiction», EJIL: Talk!, 4 March 2022, <https: 3wnm0ik=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n60 BJÖRNSTJERN BAADE, «Fake News and International Law», 29 European Journal of International Law (2018), 1357–1376, at 1369.\n61 Convention on the International Right of Correction, adopted on 16 December 1952, UN Doc. A/ RES/630(VII).\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:></genocide></https:>\nYannick Zerbe\ntomary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing, corrections of such dispatches.\nWhile the terms «correspondent» and «information agency» were defined more broadly in the Correction Convention, it is debatable whether State-sponsored «trolls» can be described as correspondents and the IRA as an information agency. Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs, the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well.⁶⁵ The IGE has come to the same conclusion.⁶⁶\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).⁶⁷ Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation⁶⁸, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration.⁶⁹ In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR⁷⁰. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.⁷¹\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated.⁷² Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro\n65 See for example Resolutions A/HRC/RES/38/7 (5 July 2018), A/HRC/RES/32/13 (1 July 2016), A/HRC/RES/26/13 (26 June 2014), A/HRC/RES/20/8 (5 July 2012).\n66 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 196.\n67 DAVID KAYE, «Disease pandemics and the freedom of opinion and expression», Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, 23 April 2020, UN Doc.

It seems clear that modern technology allows CISDOs to manipulate users efficiently and at scale.\nIn this regard, disinformation that violates art. 19(1) ICCPR may simultaneously amount to a breach of art. 25 ICCPR, which proclaims the right to free and fair elections. General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine). Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control. Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region. Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States. Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned. To what degree Russia has negative obligations to\n73 IRENE KHAN, «In my view: To tackle disinformation, we must uphold freedom of opinion and expression», in: OECD, Development Co-operation Report 2021: Shaping a Just Digital Transformation, Paris 2021, para. 36.\n74 UN Human Rights Committee, «CCPR General Comment No. 25: Article 25 (Participation in Public Affairs and the Right to Vote), The Right to Participate in Public Affairs, Voting Rights and the Right of Equal Access to Public Service», 12 July 1996, UN Doc.

International humanitarian law\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^^\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^^\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n^^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury. Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n84 Art. 51(2) API: «[...] Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.» To qualify as terror, the disinformation would have to qualify as an attack or threat thereof. Acts which result in mental injury («severe mental suffering») can be classified as an attack.\n85 See EIAN KATZ, «Liar's War: Protecting Civilians from Disinformation during Armed Conflict», 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), 659-682, at 668.\n86 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 491.\n87 ICRC, supra n. 80, para. 1493.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\ngenocide tragically demonstrated.⁸⁸ Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL.⁸⁹ According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL.⁹⁰ Relevant provisions of IHRL⁹¹ – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.⁹²\n## IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc.

However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n⁹² KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n⁹³ See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n⁹⁴ KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously.

The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n99 UN Commission on Human Rights, «The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights», 28 September 1984, UN Doc.

Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression». The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n105 SHAUN WALKER &amp; JENNIFER RANKIN, «Hungary passes law that will let Orbán rule by decree», The Guardian, 30 March 2020, available at: <https: 3pttt7f=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n106 Human Rights Watch, «Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse», 11 February 2021, <https: 3ddfxlk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n107 UN Human Rights Committee, 19th Annual Report, October 1995, UN Doc.

CCPR/C/79/Add.116, para. 24, emphasis mine.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:></https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nprotecting a «legitimate public interest».¹⁰⁹ Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl. No. 12/1984/84/131, para. 46.\n¹¹³ ECJ, Baltic Media Alliance v. Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies.¹¹⁴ As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State».¹¹⁵ The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether.¹¹⁶ This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.¹¹⁷ Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n¹¹⁴ Id., para. 79.\n¹¹⁵ See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n¹¹⁶ *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n¹¹⁷ See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nalso been spearheaded by NATO¹¹⁸ and the G7¹¹⁹. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States¹²² signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n118 Several member states of NATO and the EU in 2017 conjointly established the «European Centre of Excellence (CoE) against Hybrid Threats» in order to improve EU-NATO cooperation in the fight against disinformation. NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence also supports the alliance's countermeasures against disinformation.

How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n¹²³ Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n¹²⁴ HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation. Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n127 ZHAO, supra n. 36, at 51.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\n^{}[]"

Introduction\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with.¹ Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons,² there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade.³ Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.⁴\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations ereign States, for ways to regulate and counter CISDOs. This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation Whether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing Yannick Zerbe socio-economic cleavages in society and can thereby, for example, influence electoral processes¹⁰, disrupt the response to a public health crisis¹¹ or augment the confusion created by the fog of war¹². If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes».¹³ Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors.¹⁴ The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD¹⁵, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same. While there are many States actors besides Russia, most notably China, undertaking disinformation campaigns online, Russia's influence operations stick out due to their systematic and well-resourced nature, as well as their unprecedented scale.¹⁶ Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations ## III. Do CISDOs violate international law?\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty The duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State»¹⁷ and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law»¹⁸ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter.¹⁹ Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions²⁰ and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ²¹. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State».²² The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.²³ Whether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa Yannick Zerbe tion and system lies at the heart of sovereignty and thus squarely falls in its domaine réservé.²⁴ Likewise, the security and integrity of a State – jeopardized for example in the case of Russia's genocide disinformation in Ukraine – indisputably also qualifies. Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.²⁵ However, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way.²⁶ The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage.²⁷ As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage.²⁸ Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force.²⁹ When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value.³⁰ Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations use of force under international law. However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment.³¹ In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.³² However, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way».³³ However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.³⁴ In our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated.³⁵ Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence,³⁶ the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl- ³¹ CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

Davis Journal of International Law &amp; Policy (2020), 35–80, at 57.\n\nYannick Zerbe edge of such an operation does not preclude the breach of the principle of non-intervention.³⁷ However, some causal nexus will have to be proven between the act of the disinforming State and the desired or attained outcome, which is inherently difficult.³⁸ To prove a coercive effect behind CISDOs is further complicated by the fact that they often do not aim to produce a specific outcome, but intend to create a general atmosphere of confusion, distrust or discontent.\nThere are occasions, however, where such a causal nexus can be established more easily. For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message.³⁹ If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.⁴⁰ Since establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention.⁴¹ In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality.⁴² However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.⁴³ Furthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will.⁴⁴ Following this logic, a disinformation campaign Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations would constitute an internationally wrongful act, simply if it had the intent to coerce. The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.⁴⁵ However, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty.⁴⁶ Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law,⁴⁷ the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law.⁴⁸ However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently».⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty.⁵⁰ While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State».⁵¹ While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections⁵² – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio ⁴⁵ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n⁴⁶ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n⁴⁷ DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n⁴⁸ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁴⁹ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n⁵⁰ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁵¹ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n⁵² Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function».

However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.⁵³ Nonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n## B. International communications law ### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace In 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),⁵⁴, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding».⁵⁵ Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War,⁵⁶ the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that: The High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified»⁵⁷. It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies. In para. 2 of art. 3, the Convention further includes the right for a State ⁵³ SCHMITT, supra n. 38, at 47.\n⁵⁴ International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace, adopted on 16 September 1936, UN Doc. A/RES/841.\n⁵⁵ See the Convention’s preamble and operational provisions.\n⁵⁶ JOHN B. WHITTON, «War by Radio», Foreign Affairs, April 1941, <https: 3hehqmq=\"\"fam.ag=\"\">.\n⁵⁷ See art. 4 of the Convention (emphasis mine). Article 2 of the Convention further prohibits war propaganda.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations party to demand rectification from the States that transmitted wrong information, regardless of whether the transmitting States was aware of its incorrectness.\nHowever, the Convention suffers from inherent weaknesses. Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it.[58] Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine[59], the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State.[60] However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction A similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention).[61] The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared: All correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus- Yannick Zerbe tomary practice of transmitting through the same channels, or of publishing, corrections of such dispatches.[62] While the terms «correspondent» and «information agency» were defined more broadly in the Correction Convention, it is debatable whether State-sponsored «trolls» can be described as correspondents and the IRA as an information agency. Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.[63] Like the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs,[64] the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n## C. International human rights law The Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations therefore be respected in cyberspace as well.⁶⁵ The IGE has come to the same conclusion.⁶⁶ Cyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).⁶⁷ Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation⁶⁸, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration.⁶⁹ In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR⁷⁰. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.⁷¹ Disinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR. This article *inter alia* protects the right not to have one’s opinions manipulated.⁷² Irene Khan, the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has stated that «involuntary or non-consensual manipulation of the thinking pro Yannick Zerbe cess to develop an opinion» are a violation of that right.[73] It seems clear that modern technology allows CISDOs to manipulate users efficiently and at scale.\nIn this regard, disinformation that violates art. 19(1) ICCPR may simultaneously amount to a breach of art. 25 ICCPR, which proclaims the right to free and fair elections. General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine).[74] Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control.[75] Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region.[76] Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States.[77] Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used. Thus, if Russia spreads disinformation about the efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines in Germany, IHRL is applicable only insofar as Germany's due diligence obligations to protect its own population are concerned. To what degree Russia has negative obligations to Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations abstain from violating the human rights of the population of Germany remains controversial.\n## D. International humanitarian law Russia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^[78]^ Ruses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^[79]^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^[80]^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^[81]^ However, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^[82]^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^[83]^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio ^[78]^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^[79]^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either. In many cases it will allow a successful operation with less loss of life than through the simple use of force».

Katz even argues that, if a causal link can be established between the injury or death that resulted from a violation of IHL and a disinformation operation, the act of spreading disinformation amounts to a direct participation in hostilities, in which case the author thereof (even if civilian) becomes a legitimate target under IHL. \nMost importantly, however, a CISDO may amount to a violation of IHL if it qualifies as an act of perfidy. A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury.[86] Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently: On the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations genocide tragically demonstrated.⁸⁸ Likewise, disinformation in Myanmar and Syria has prompted attacks on humanitarian workers, who enjoy special protection under IHL.⁸⁹ According to common article 1 of the Geneva Convention, States must «ensure respect» for IHL «under all circumstances» from which derives a positive obligation to discourage violations thereof. Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL.⁹⁰ Relevant provisions of IHRL⁹¹ – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC. However, the perception of disinformation as simple ruses of war, in times when such disinformation is not limited to deceive the enemy’s combatants but intended to jeopardize the safety of its civilians, seems to be outdated and thus IHL may need a re-adjustment in this regard.⁹² ## IV. What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression The legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\"wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc. A/HRC/39/CRP.2, para. 1324.\n⁹⁰ KNUT DÖRMANN &amp; JOSE SERRALVO, «Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions and the Obligation to Prevent International Humanitarian Law Violations», 96 International Review of the Red Cross (2014), 707–736.\n⁹¹ IHRL generally applies both in peacetime and during armed conflict. However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n⁹² KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n⁹³ See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n⁹⁴ KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n\nYannick Zerbe Thus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee: a) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty); b) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy); c) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵ States have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim ⁹⁵ Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34. The ECtHR has developed a similar test of its own.

The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that: a. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100 The Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104 When applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at Yannick Zerbe least the two first conditions. Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.[105] Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.[106] Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression».[107] The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].[108] The central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations protecting a «legitimate public interest».¹⁰⁹ Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust ¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.» ¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl. No. 12/1984/84/131, para. 46.\n¹¹³ ECJ, Baltic Media Alliance v. Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n\nYannick Zerbe and accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies.¹¹⁴ As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State».¹¹⁵ The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether.¹¹⁶ This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.¹¹⁷ Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have ¹¹⁴ Id., para. 79.\n¹¹⁵ See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n¹¹⁶ *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n¹¹⁷ See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations also been spearheaded by NATO¹¹⁸ and the G7¹¹⁹. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States¹²² signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and Yannick Zerbe condemn, prevent and fight such actions».¹²³ Furthermore, on 1 April 2022, the UN Human Rights Council adopted – by consensus – resolution 49/21 on the «[r]ole of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights».¹²⁴ Therein, the Council, «[c]oncerned by the increasing and far-reaching negative impact on the enjoyment and realization of human rights» of disinformation, called upon States to «refrain from conducting or sponsoring disinformation campaigns domestically or transnationally for political or other purposes, and encourages them to condemn such acts».¹²⁵ Finally, UNSG Antonio Guterres in his latest report on «Our Common Agenda» called for a «global code of conduct that promotes integrity in public information» to be established conjointly by member states, regulatory bodies and media outlets under the auspices of the UN.¹²⁶ All of the aforementioned documents are legally non-binding but nonetheless constitute important evidence of emerging soft law on which new regulation may be based.\n## V. How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity ¹²³ Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\"bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n¹²⁴ HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc. A/HRC/RES/49/21.\n¹²⁵ See preamble and operational paragraph 5.\n¹²⁶ United Nations, «Our common agenda: Report of the Secretary-General», 2021, <https: 3pgrbgj=\"\"bit.ly=\"\">, at 27. This initiative was received largely positively by member states. United Nations, «Delegates Welcome Code of Conduct Initiative, Call for Mainstreaming Multilingualism, as Committee on Information Continues Session», 4 May 2022, <https: 3pgrvf1=\"\"bit.ly=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations yet wide reach – demonstrates the need for clarification of the applicability of these principles with regard to cyber influence operations. The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation.[127] Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n\nYannick Zerbe While the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion This article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State ¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\"bit.ly=\"\">.\n\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations conducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n\n^{}[]"

Introduction\n\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with.¹ Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons,² there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade.³ Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.⁴\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n1 The World Economic Forum in 2013 identified the rapid dissemination of disinformation, i.e. the dissemination of deliberately false or misleading information to deceive the public and thereby cause public harm, as one of the most important trends in society.

This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n\n---\n\n## __postscript__\n\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc. A/HRC/39/CRP.2, para. 1324.\n⁹⁰ KNUT DÖRMANN &amp; JOSE SERRALVO, «Common Article 1 to the Geneva Conventions and the Obligation to Prevent International Humanitarian Law Violations», 96 International Review of the Red Cross (2014), 707–736.\n⁹¹ IHRL generally applies both in peacetime and during armed conflict. However, some IHRL provisions allow for derogations by States during times of a «public emergency threatening the life of the nation». See art. 4 ICCPR.\n⁹² KATZ, supra n. 85, at 662, 666.\n⁹³ See art. 19 of the ICCPR, art. 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, art. 10 of the ECHR and art. 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n⁹⁴ KHAN, supra n. 73, para. 34.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nYannick Zerbe\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law. New restrictions on the freedom of expression would evidently have to pass the three-part test of the UN Human Rights Committee presented previously. Guidance on the second condition (principle of legitimacy) is provided by the so-called Syracuse Principles on the Lim\n⁹⁵ Human Rights Committee, «General Comment 34», 2011, UN Doc. CCPR/C/GC/34. The ECtHR has developed a similar test of its own.

The latter were the outcome of a discussion in 1984 among distinguished human rights experts and were adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in the following year.99 The legally non-binding principles stipulate *inter alia* that:\na. National security may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only when they are taken to protect the existence of the nation or its territorial integrity or political independence against force or threat of force.\nb. National security cannot be invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats to law and order.\nc. National security cannot be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations and may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies against abuse. [...] 100\nThe Syracuse Principles were complemented in 1999 by the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information (hereinafter Johannesburg Principles).101 The latter reiterate the basic conditions that must be respected when restricting the freedom of expression, i.e. the necessity for a legal basis and a proportional and necessary response to a legitimate national security interest. Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n99 UN Commission on Human Rights, «The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights», 28 September 1984, UN Doc.

Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression». The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n105 SHAUN WALKER &amp; JENNIFER RANKIN, «Hungary passes law that will let Orbán rule by decree», The Guardian, 30 March 2020, available at: <https: 3pttt7f=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n106 Human Rights Watch, «Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse», 11 February 2021, <https: 3ddfxlk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n107 UN Human Rights Committee, 19th Annual Report, October 1995, UN Doc.

Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl. No. 12/1984/84/131, para. 46.\n¹¹³ ECJ, Baltic Media Alliance v. Lietuvos radijo, Case C-622/17, EU:C:2019:566.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nand accused these countries of allegedly nationalistic and neo-Nazi internal policies.¹¹⁴ As a legal basis the Court referenced the Lithuanian «Law on information for the public», which prohibits the active dissemination of disinformation threatening the «sovereignty and integrity of the Lithuanian State».¹¹⁵ The ECJ agreed in this ruling with the decision of the LRTC and thus held that *limiting* the spread of foreign disinformation from a source is more apt to pass the proportionality test than *banning* the source altogether.¹¹⁶ This judgement thus represents an important precedent about how States can respond to disinformation through prescriptive measures without excessively limiting fundamental rights.\n## B. A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.¹¹⁷ Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n¹¹⁴ Id., para. 79.\n¹¹⁵ See Art. 19 of said law: «1. It shall be prohibited to publish in the media information which: 1) incites to change the constitutional order of the Republic of Lithuania through the use of force; 2) instigates attempts against the sovereignty of the Republic of Lithuania, its territorial integrity and political independence [...].» Republic of Lithuania, «Law on the Provision of Information to the Public», adopted on 2 July 1996, No I-1418.\n¹¹⁶ *Baltic Media Alliance case*, supra n. 114, para. 84.\n¹¹⁷ See the East StratCom Force discussed in Chapter IV.3.a.i. or the EU Intelligence and Situation Centre.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nalso been spearheaded by NATO¹¹⁸ and the G7¹¹⁹. As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention. Twenty States¹²² signed a document under the aegis of the UNGA in which they declared to «[c]ombat any unduly restrictive measure against the right to freedom of opinion and expression and take measures to prevent manipulation of information by States or non-States actors, and\n118 Several member states of NATO and the EU in 2017 conjointly established the «European Centre of Excellence (CoE) against Hybrid Threats» in order to improve EU-NATO cooperation in the fight against disinformation. NATO's Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence also supports the alliance's countermeasures against disinformation.

How should international law regulate CISDOs?\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree. However, even if CISDOs may in some cases amount to a violation of the principle of non-intervention or sovereignty, their *sui generis* nature – characterized by their covertness and less visible coercive effect, as well as their low intensity\n¹²³ Forum on Information &amp; Democracy, «International Partnership for Information and Democracy», <https: 3ti9im9=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 27(8).\n¹²⁴ HRC, «Role of States in countering the negative impact of disinformation on the enjoyment and realization of human rights», Resolution 49/21, adopted on 1 April 2022, UN Doc.

The merits of a new international regime become apparent as well when considering the absence of extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportionate and lawful to react to CISDOs.\nAny new legal framework under international law regulating CISDOs must not derogate from existing international law but complement it. The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation. Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n127 ZHAO, supra n. 36, at 51.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\nYannick Zerbe\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\nVI. Conclusion\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>\nCyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\nconducting, instructing, organizing, or financing CISDOs in the first place. For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n33 SRIEL (2023)\n^{}[]",

    "Yannick Zerbe\n\n# I. Introduction\n\nIn what some have dubbed the «post-truth» era, cyber-enabled international State-sponsored disinformation operations (CISDOs) have become a force to be reckoned with.¹ Although the intentional spread of falsehoods in international relations is nothing new, the advent of the internet – and especially social media – have enabled disinformation operations to become vastly more effective. Nowadays, disinformation can reach more people, at a faster rate and a fraction of the cost – all while its authors hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace. From «fake news» being spread during the US presidential election in 2016 or the Brexit vote, to disinformation about the efficacy of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic and baseless accusations about an alleged genocide being committed by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas – CISDOs lay bare the dual-use nature of social media and its potentially adverse effects on national security, public health and democratic institutions.\n\nOverwhelmingly conducted by Russia and China as an additional tool in their arsenal of offensive cyberweapons,² there has been an increase in CISDOs over the past decade.³ Typically at the receiving end of CISDOs, democracies around the globe have come up with various countermeasures to prevent or punish disinformation, including fact-checking bodies, media literacy campaigns or «anti-fake news» laws. On 2 March 2022, the Council of the European Union decided to suspend the broadcasting activities of the Kremlin-affiliated media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the EU, an unprecedent step for the self-declared alliance of democracies that has fervently defended the freedom of expression and the media within and outside its borders.⁴\n\nCuriously, international law has not been considered by many as an important instrument to regulate disinformation. Given the transnational harm and destabilizing effect of State-sponsored disinformation, however, it seems logical to turn to international law, whose primary purpose is to ensure the peaceful co-existence of sov\n\n1 The World Economic Forum in 2013 identified the rapid dissemination of disinformation, i.e. the dissemination of deliberately false or misleading information to deceive the public and thereby cause public harm, as one of the most important trends in society.

This article will thus aim to complement the existing academic literature on disinformation by providing tentative answers to three central questions: Do CISDOs violate international law? What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law? How should international law regulate CISDOs? To answer the first question, I will examine the lawfulness of CISDOs with regard to general principles as well as different branches of international law, namely human rights, communications and humanitarian law.\n\nSince I will focus on cyber-enabled disinformation, I will refer in my analysis to the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare (hereinafter Tallinn Manual), in order to ascertain how the experts behind the Manual may have assessed a certain rule's applicability to cyber disinformation. As a working definition of disinformation, this article will rely on the European Commission's definition which describes disinformation as «verifiably false or misleading information that is created, presented and disseminated for economic gain or to intentionally deceive the public, and may cause public harm». After I outline the obstacles that currently complicate the regulation of disinformation through international law, I conclude with recommendations about the way forward to overcome those obstacles, notably through an international convention prohibiting CISDOs.\n\n## II. A (very) brief introduction to disinformation\n\nWhether used during peace or wartime, disinformation ultimately serves one goal: to obtain «particular advantages (either military or political) by using false messages (targeting military or civilians)». Disinformation thereby relies on the practice of «reflexive control», which aims to guide an adversary's actions in one's favor, by changing its perception of the facts. The ultimate goal of disinformation, however, does not necessarily have to be an individual outcome, such as changing the result of an election. In fact, most CISDOs pursue the broader goal of creating an atmosphere of distrust, especially toward governmental institutions. Disinformation thus exploits existing\n\n5 Michael N.

If effective and widespread, disinformation can thus become a threat to (inter-)national security.\n\nAlthough State-sponsored disinformation is nothing new, the advent of social media initiated a revolution in the disinformation game. Social media has simultaneously reduced the cost and increased the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, while making it easier to obscure authorship of disinformation. Especially artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled State-sponsored disinformation to become more efficient, effective, and scalable via so-called «(social) bots» and synthetic media, commonly known as «deep fakes».¹³ Furthermore, while in the past they were organized and conducted exclusively by government agencies, today's CISDOs are often outsourced to private actors.¹⁴ The Russian «Internet Research Agency» (IRA), a professionally run disinformation corporation with a yearly estimated budget of around 12 million USD¹⁵, is probably the most infamous «troll farm».\n\nAlthough the technology and the techniques behind State-sponsored disinformation have changed since the Cold War, the key actor remains the same.

    "Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n\n## III. Do CISDOs violate international law?\n\n### A. The principles of non-intervention and State sovereignty\n\nThe duty of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States constitutes «one of the fundamental duties of the State»¹⁷ and has been accepted as «part and parcel of customary international law»¹⁸ by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It is derived from the principle of sovereignty laid down in Article 2 (1) of the UN Charter.¹⁹ Although it is evident that States do not operate in a vacuum and thus influence each other – whether directly or indirectly, willingly or unwillingly – certain types of interventions in the internal affairs (domaine réservé) of other States were formally prohibited by international law through the UN Charter and subsequent UNGA resolutions²⁰ and further defined by the jurisprudence of the ICJ²¹. UNGA Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 1970, dubbed the Friendly Relations Declaration, was instrumental in setting out the boundaries for intervention and declared that no States had «the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State» and that every State «has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic, social and cultural systems, without interference in any form by another State».²² The International Group of Experts (IGE), which authored the Tallinn Manual, has confirmed that the principle of non-intervention applies to cyberspace.²³\n\nWhether a given CISDO amounts to an intervention in the sense of international law depends on two conditions: (1) it must encroach upon the domaine réservé of another State and (2) it must be coercive. CISDOs typically target prerogatives and institutions that clearly fall into a State's domaine réservé. This is especially true with regards to disinformation campaigns that aim to disrupt or manipulate democratic elections. In fact, the IGE has stipulated that a State's choice of its political organisa\n\n17 PHILIP KUNIG, «Intervention, Prohibition of», Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law, <https: 3uukhiz=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 7.\n18 ICJ, Nicaragua v.

Furthermore, the government of the Netherlands has affirmed that «cyber enabled information operations that intervene with, for example national crisis response mechanisms during a health crisis» could amount to a violation of international law.²⁵\n\nHowever, whether CISDOs fulfill the second condition of prohibited intervention – coercion – is more controversial. Coercion describes the ability of a State to compel another to act in an involuntary way.²⁶ The degree of coerciveness of cyberoperations depends on their primary effect. The strongest level of coercion is attained through cyberoperations that can be assimilated to a use of force. Several States have asserted that offensive cyberoperations can indeed be likened to a use of force in the traditional sense if they generate effects that are comparable to those produced by kinetic military action and thus have to potential to inflict physical damage.²⁷ As an example of such an operation, one may refer to the so-called «Stuxnet Virus», which disrupted operations at an Iranian nuclear facility over several months and thereby caused significant damage.²⁸ Furthermore, the Netherlands have claimed that cyber operations which have a «very serious financial or economic impact» may also be likened to a use of force.²⁹ When Syrian hackers in 2013 gained control of the Twitter account of AP News and published a tweet claiming that US President Barack Obama had been injured in an attack, the Dow Jones lost USD 136 Billion in market value.³⁰ Although the market quickly recovered after the false news was corrected, there are certainly scenarios in which disinformation could have a serious and more permanent impact on the economy, and thereby – according to some – qualify as a\n\n24 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 315.\n25 UNODA, «The Kingdom of the Netherlands' Response to the Pre-draft Report of the OEWG», Open-ended Working Group, 2020, <https: 3kdriut=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">, para. 18.\n26 Tallinn Manual 2.0: «[Rule 66] prohibits coercive intervention, including by cyber means, by one State into the internal or external affairs of another.» SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 312 (emphasis mine); Jammejad and Wood argue that «if the pressure is such that it could be reasonably resisted, the sovereign will of the target state has not been subordinated».

However, to categorize a CISDO as a use of force would clearly stretch the ICJ's interpretation of «force», laid down as precedent in the Nicaragua judgment.³¹ In fact, the Tallinn Manual asserts that «non-destructive cyber psychological operations intended solely to undermine confidence in a government» would normally not qualify as a use of force.³²\n\nHowever, coercion does not necessarily need to be attained through the use – or threat of the use – of force. In fact, State intervention in cyberspace may also include acts «designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way».³³ However, the IGE has made clear that simply influencing the voluntary actions of another States would not amount to a violation of the prohibition of non-intervention.³⁴\n\nIn our analysis, the coerciveness of cyberoperations that deploy their effects on the cognitive level must be considered. Because CISDOs, by themselves, do not directly destroy infrastructure or data, their coercive effect is more difficult to ascertain. For example, the Russian attempts to influence the voting habits of American and British citizens through disinformation were conducted to help attain results in democratic elections that were more favorable to purported Russian interests – or at least in order to diminish the people's trust in the electoral process. In the cases of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016, the results aligned with Russian objectives: Donald Trump was elected US President and the British people voted to leave the EU. Furthermore, in the case of Trump's failed re-election in 2020, a significant part of the population believed that the process had been manipulated.³⁵ Thus, if the citizens of these respective countries – or at least enough of them to tip the vote in their favor – had voted differently or had not lost trust in the democratic process without their exposure to foreign disinformation then the latter could be considered coercive. By manipulating the will of the people of the target States, such disinformation undermines the latter's choice over its political organization and thus amounts to a prohibited form of intervention.\n\nThe covert nature of such an intrusion does not exclude a coercive effect. Although Zhao claims that for coercion to be applied against an audience, the latter must be aware of the influence,³⁶ the majority of the IGE has maintained that knowl-\n\n³¹ CHRISTINE GRAY, «The International Court of Justice and the Use of Force», in: C.

For example, disinformation could be spread to create confusion about the location or the modalities of an election. By engineering voter suppression, such disinformation could be considered coercive, as it has a direct effect on the votes in, and thus possibly on the outcome of, an election. Such disinformation was spread during the 2016 US presidential election when Twitter ads (of unknown origin) falsely claimed that citizens could vote for candidate Hillary Clinton remotely via text message.³⁹ If one can establish, for example by way of a representative survey, that a significant share of voters were actively discouraged from voting for reasons that can be directly traced back to a specific disinformation operation, one could qualify that operation as coercive.⁴⁰\n\nSince establishing a causal nexus between the goals and the outcomes of CISDOs is difficult, some scholars wish to attenuate the condition of causality. Schmitt has called for indirect causation to be sufficient when assessing the wrongfulness of cyber-enabled disinformation campaigns under the norm of non-intervention.⁴¹ In fact, this reasoning is in line with that of the IGE which has affirmed that even an indirect coercive effect suffices to satisfy the requisite causality.⁴² However, Schmitt also cautions that indirect coercion would «move the activity along the continuum in the direction of interference and away from intervention», since the coercive effect in this case is much harder to prove.⁴³\n\nFurthermore, Moynihan and a majority of the IGE have asserted that the coercive behavior of a disinforming State does not necessarily need to be successful in depriving the target State of its free will.⁴⁴ Following this logic, a disinformation campaign\n\n37 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n38 MICHAEL SCHMITT, «Virtual Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law», 19 Chicago Journal of International Law (2018), 32–67, at 51.\n39 DEREK HAWKINS, «No, you can’t text your vote.

    "Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n\nwould constitute an internationally wrongful act, simply if it had the intent to coerce. The legal evaluation of disinformation campaigns would thus hinge on the means employed and the results pursued and not on the results achieved. Furthermore, even a threat to intervene may be unlawful if it is coercive in nature.⁴⁵\n\nHowever, even if a given CISDO does not qualify as intervention, that does not render it automatically lawful, since it may still constitute a violation of State sovereignty. In fact, some scholars have argued that, since the principle of non-intervention applies to coercive acts only, the principle of sovereignty should be relied on in the cyber context where coercion is less visible, since coercion is not a necessary element of a violation of sovereignty.⁴⁶ Although there exists an ongoing debate within academia about whether the principle of sovereignty constitutes a primary rule of international law,⁴⁷ the IGE has asserted though that it represents a separate and enforceable rule under international law.⁴⁸ However, even more controversial than the debate about whether sovereignty constitutes a primary rule is the question what a non-coercive violation of sovereignty in cyberspace entails, especially since sovereignty has traditionally been connoted with physical incursions of territorial borders. Moynihan states that sovereignty is generally violated when «a state exercises its authority in another state’s territory without consent in relation to an area over which the territorial state has the exclusive right to exercise its state powers independently».⁴⁹ The Tallinn Manual has declared that cyber operations that «prevent or disregard another State’s exercise of its sovereign prerogatives» form a violation of sovereignty.⁵⁰ While the infliction of physical damage or injury in another State would, according to the IGE, clearly present a violation of the principle of sovereignty, no consensus could be reached among the experts «whether, and if so, when, a cyber operation that results in neither physical damage nor the loss of functionality could amount to a violation of sovereignty» unless such an operation «interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State».⁵¹ While the Tallinn Manual does not define «inherently governmental functions», such a description ought to be fairly congruent with the prerogatives that fall into a State’s domaine réservé. Thus, under a broad interpretation of sovereignty, any action that interferes in an inherently governmental function, such as the organization of elections⁵² – even indirectly, on the cognitive level and without coercion – would constitute a vio\n\n⁴⁵ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 320.\n⁴⁶ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 94.\n⁴⁷ DUNCAN HOLLIS, «The Influence of War; the War for Influence», 32 Temple International &amp; Comparative Law Journal (2018), 31–46, at 41.\n⁴⁸ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁴⁹ MOYNIHAN, supra n. 33, at 14.\n⁵⁰ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 17.\n⁵¹ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 21.\n⁵² Schmitt calls the holding of elections a «a paradigmatic example of an inherently governmental function».

However, most scholars agree that some degree of interference is necessary and that, for example, unsuccessful attempts to usurp the governmental functions of another State would not qualify as a violation of sovereignty.⁵³\n\nNonetheless, the differentiation between prohibited and allowed interference is far less clear when applying the principle of sovereignty instead of non-intervention, which adds the condition of coercive effect. Thus, even if one adopts the view that Rule 4 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a primary rule of international law, CISDOs – absent any direct disruption of governmental functions, such as the hacking of voting machines – would most likely fall into the grey zones of a modern interpretation of State sovereignty under international law.\n\n## B. International communications law\n\n### 1. The international convention concerning the use of broadcasting in the cause of peace\n\nIn 1936, the member states of the League of Nations, the UN’s predecessor, adopted the International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace (hereinafter Broadcasting Convention),⁵⁴, whose purpose is the safeguarding of «good international understanding».⁵⁵ Set up as a means to counter the aggressive propaganda spread by both sides during the First World War,⁵⁶ the Convention survived and remains in force and applicable today for the 29 States that have ratified it (including Russia), even though communication technology has evolved beyond recognition since the treaty’s inception. Article 3(1) of the Convention declares that:\n\nThe High Contracting Parties mutually undertake to prohibit and, if occasion arises, to stop without delay within their respective territories any transmission likely to harm good international understanding by statements the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons responsible for the broadcast.\n\nThe Broadcasting Convention does not require that the (dis)information diffused passes a threshold of coerciveness but instead mandates that the ratifying States ensure that they broadcast «information concerning international relations the accuracy of which shall have been verified»⁵⁷. It thus requires that States fact-check information that is diffused either by state-owned media or by private broadcasting companies.

Firstly, with only 29 State parties, its territorial applicability is limited. Furthermore, even for most of the States that have ratified it, its provisions are not automatically enforceable. In fact, all former socialist States entered a reservation to art. 7 of the Convention at the time of ratification, which normally would enable the Permanent Court of International Justice – and thus also its successor, the ICJ – to exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising from it.[58] Thus, even if Russia potentially violated art. 2 and 3 of the Broadcasting Convention through its genocide disinformation campaign around Ukraine[59], the ICJ would not be able to declare such a violation. Furthermore, the Convention only covers disinformation that originates directly from another State.[60] However, while some disinformation does cross State frontiers, some State-sponsored disinformation is spread by States agents who are already physically located in the target States. Furthermore, with regard to CISDOs it is inherently difficult to trace disinformation back to a specific geographic location. Most notably, however, the Broadcasting Convention was drafted at a time when most of the information that had the potential to «harm good international understanding» was spread by a handful of traditional media outlets with centralized organizational structures. While a dynamic interpretation of «broadcasting» may include social media as well, the vast amount of data created and shared today renders it unmanageable, even for the technologically most developed States. The correction of false statements by States would thus necessitate disproportionate bureaucratic efforts that would neither be effective nor desirable.\n\n## 2. The Convention on the International Right of Correction\n\nA similar instrument to the 1936 Broadcasting Convention is the 1952 Convention on the International Right of Correction (hereinafter Correction Convention).[61] The Correction Convention, adopted by the UN General Assembly at the initiative of France, declared:\n\nAll correspondents and information agencies should, in the case of news dispatches transmitted or published by them and which have been demonstrated to be false or distorted, follow the cus-\n\n58 United Nations Treaty Collection, «International Convention concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace: Ratifications or definitive accessions», <https: 3wuktyu=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n\n59 TALITA DE SOUZA DIAS, «Russia's <genocide disinformation=\"\"> and war propaganda are breaches of the International Convention Concerning the Use of Broadcasting in the Cause of Peace and fall within the ICJ's jurisdiction», EJIL: Talk!, 4 March 2022, <https: 3wnm0ik=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n\n60 BJÖRNSTJERN BAADE, «Fake News and International Law», 29 European Journal of International Law (2018), 1357–1376, at 1369.\n\n61 Convention on the International Right of Correction, adopted on 16 December 1952, UN Doc.

Online media outlets such as RT or Sputnik News would indisputably qualify, however.\n\nThe Convention did not establish a procedure through which information ought to be verified. It did, however, foresee the possibility of a contracting State to submit its version of the facts to those States from which the information originated, in case the targeted State's «national prestige or dignity» was harmed due to the incorrect information in question. If the State does not relay the corrected information to the media that originally published the information for correction, the case ought to be referred to the UN Secretary-General who «shall give publicity to the information» (Art. IV). Unlike the Broadcasting Convention, the Correction Convention is also applicable with regard to «distorted» news and thus not limited to «false» news.[63]\n\nLike the Broadcasting Convention, the letter of the Correction Convention lends itself to the interpretation that CISDOs would be covered by it. The Correction Convention, however, equally dates to a time of vastly different technological capabilities to spread disinformation. Furthermore, the Correction Convention also has never been enforced and with a mere 17 States parties (Russia or China not being one of them) does not enjoy sufficient applicability. Moreover, although member states have used the UN as a forum to raise awareness about CISDOs,[64] the idea that the UN itself is supposed to showcase one State's disinformation campaigns against another would dangerously instrumentalize the office of the Secretary-General and would force the latter to become an arbiter of truth on the world stage. While the Correction Convention presents an interesting approach, the current standing of the UN, the impossibility in many cases to attribute CISDOs clearly to a State as well as the geopolitical status quo make it a largely useless instrument in the legal toolbox to counter CISDOs.\n\n## C. International human rights law\n\nThe Human Rights Council has affirmed through various resolutions that international human rights law (IHRL) applies to the internet and that human rights must\n\n33 SRIEL (2023)",
    "Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n\ntherefore be respected in cyberspace as well.⁶⁵ The IGE has come to the same conclusion.⁶⁶\n\nCyber-enabled disinformation poses a threat to various human rights. By spreading inaccurate information about the efficacy or safety of vaccines, States who create and spread disinformation may violate the right to health of the targeted population, laid down in art. 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).⁶⁷ Since disinformation is often designed to harm the victims’ reputation⁶⁸, potential violations of art. 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) must be taken into consideration.⁶⁹ In extreme cases, disinformation containing hate speech may even amount to a violation of art. 20(2) ICCPR⁷⁰. By fueling the flames of hatred and violence – as in the case with Russian disinformation toward Ukraine – one could even argue that such war propaganda constitutes a violation of the right to life of Ukrainian citizens laid down in art. 6 ICCPR.⁷¹\n\nDisinformation may also violate the freedom of opinion of a person that is exposed to it, enshrined in art. 19(1) ICCPR.

General Comment No. 25 of the UN Human Rights Committee stipulates that « [v]oters should be able to form opinions independently, free of violence or threat of violence, compulsion, inducement or manipulative interference of any kind» (emphasis mine).[74] Through micro-targeting, CISDOs have the potential to interfere subtly and manipulatively and thus violate art. 25 ICCPR.\n\nHowever, since this article is devoted to analyzing international disinformation operations, considering the extraterritorial effect of human rights obligations is essential. The State-centered nature of IHRL means that their exercise is still largely confined to national borders, or at least territorial control.[75] Thus, Germany owes negative and positive human rights obligations deriving from the international human rights treaties it has ratified toward the population living within its borders. It does not owe the same obligations vis-à-vis the citizens living in neighboring France. However, States that control parts of other States, according to the doctrine of effective control must ensure that human rights are respected in that region.[76] Russia, for example, must ensure the human rights of citizens living under its control in the occupied regions of Ukraine. In absence of territorial control, Milanovic argues that no obligations are owed to the population living in other States.[77] Although there is an ongoing academic debate about «transnationalizing» IHRL, faced with the inability of the current State-centered approach to capture globalized phenomena such as migration, transboundary environmental harm or, in fact, international disinformation operations, States and international courts are cautious to expand the extraterritorial reach of IHRL, especially in cases where no kinetic force is used.

International humanitarian law\n\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine serves as the most recent demonstration of how disinformation can be used as a tool of hybrid warfare in an international armed conflict (IAC). It seems thus pertinent to analyze disinformation under the lens of the laws of armed conflict, also known as *jus in bello* or international humanitarian law (IHL). The IGE has affirmed that IHL applies to cyber operations and thus CISDOs, if they are conducted as part of an armed conflict.^[78]^\n\nRuses and other methods of deception and propaganda have always been part of warfare. Therefore, IHL takes a realist approach to deception and does not prohibit deceptive methods outright. In fact, art. 37(2) of the Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions (API) confirms the permissibility of ruses of war and explicitly mentions «misinformation» as an allowed – and possibly even preferred^[79]^ – tactic in warfare. The Tallinn Manual similarly affirms that «psychological warfare activities» or the «transmission of false information causing an opponent erroneously to believe operations are about to occur or are underway» fall under the category of permissible ruses.^[80]^ Most States have defined in their military manuals that misinformation falls under the category of a permissible ruse.^[81]^\n\nHowever, there are types of disinformation that are prohibited, even in war. In this category fall for example so-called false flag operations which aim to pin the blame of an attack on the adverse party.^[82]^ Before the large-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, it was expected that Russia would resort to a disinformation operation claiming that a Ukrainian attack on Russia had taken place, in order to portray its invasion as self-defense.^[83]^ Furthermore, if the main objective of the disinformation is to spread terror among the civilian population, it may amount to a vio\n\n^[78]^ SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 375.\n^[79]^ ICRC commentary on art. 37 API: «A ruse is not only in no way unlawful, but is not immoral either.

A perfidious act, according to Art. 37(1) AP I, invites «the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with the intent to betray that confidence». Perfidy is forbidden under any circumstances.\n\nThe Tallinn Manual also includes a rule prohibiting perfidy through cyber means, albeit limiting perfidious acts to those resulting in death and injury.[86] Thus, in order to qualify as prohibited perfidy, a CISDO has to fulfill three conditions concurrently:\n\n1. It must relate to the protection enjoyed by a particular person, object or activity, that is specifically provided for in IHL;\n2. It must invite the confidence of the adversary and lead him to believe that his adversary is entitled to protection under IHL;\n3. It must result in - or at least attempt - an injury or death of a person belonging to the adversarial party.[87]\n\nOn the basis of the abovementioned conditions, the following scenario could be envisioned: In an IAC, State A conducts a CISDO that leads the forces of State B to believe that A has surrendered, for example through a large-scale social media operation amplified through bots. The armed forces of State A then abuse the confidence of State B, which believes that the hostilities have ended, to launch another offensive and attack its combatants. This would constitute an act of perfidy, insofar as State A led State B to believe that A's combatants, due to their alleged surrender, are hors de combat and thus enjoy protection from hostilities.\n\nFinally, due to the hybrid nature of modern warfare, disinformation is increasingly targeted at civilian audiences of conflict settings. Disinformation that vilifies certain groups may incite violations of IHL by civilians on civilians, as the Rwandan\n\n84 Art. 51(2) API: «[...] Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.» To qualify as terror, the disinformation would have to qualify as an attack or threat thereof. Acts which result in mental injury («severe mental suffering») can be classified as an attack.\n85 See EIAN KATZ, «Liar's War: Protecting Civilians from Disinformation during Armed Conflict», 102 International Review of the Red Cross (2020), 659-682, at 668.\n86 SCHMITT, supra n. 5, at 491.\n87 ICRC, supra n. 80, para. 1493.\n\n33 SRIEL (2023)",

Thus, States have a due diligence obligation to ensure that no disinformation is spread by their forces that is in violation of IHL.⁹⁰ Relevant provisions of IHRL⁹¹ – as outlined in the previous chapter – add another set of legal obligations concerning the use of disinformation during an IAC.

What challenges complicate the regulation of CISDOs under international law?\n\n### A. Limits imposed by international standards on freedom of expression\n\nThe legal regulation of disinformation typically requires restricting the human right to freedom of expression, included in regional and international human rights instruments.⁹³ Art. 19 ICCPR stipulates that the freedom of expression includes the «freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers». It may be restricted by States, since, unlike the freedom of opinion, it is not an absolute right.⁹⁴ However, such restrictions must not be arbitrary and only be considered to protect an important individual or collective right from an imminent threat.\n\n⁸⁸ CHRISTINE KELLOW &amp; LESLIE STEEVES, «The Role of Radio in the Rwandan Genocide», 48 Journal of Communication (1998), 107–128.\n\n⁸⁹ LOUISA LOVELUCK, «Russian Disinformation Campaign Targets Syria’s Beleaguered Rescue Workers», Washington Post, 18 December 2018, <https: 36ameep=\"\" wapo.st=\"\">; HRC, «Report of the Detailed Findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar», 17 September 2018, UN Doc.

    "Yannick Zerbe\n\nThus, according to paragraph 3(b) of art. 19 ICCPR, certain restrictions may be imposed on the freedom of speech «a) [f]or respect of the rights or reputations of others [and] b) [f]or the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals». In order to determine the legality of a restriction of the freedom of expression, a three-part test has been established by the UN Human Rights Committee:\n\na) The restriction is provided by law (principle of legal certainty);\nb) The restriction is based on grounds foreseen by art. 19(3) ICCPR (principle of legitimacy);\nc) The restriction is the least intrusive and most effective mean of achieving the pursued aim (principle of proportionality and necessity).⁹⁵\n\nStates have criminalized within their domestic legal systems certain types of speech that threaten the individual reputation of individuals, such as hate speech or genocide denial, or that constitute a menace to national security, such as terrorist propaganda. Disinformation sometimes contains such speech and in these cases is already prohibited *a priori*. Thus, although many pointed to Germany’s «Network Enforcement Law» (Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz; NetzDG) as a *sui generis* law combatting disinformation⁹⁶, it did in fact little more than force social media platforms to remove speech that was already prohibited by the German Criminal Code.\n\nAnother type of speech that is prohibited by international law is war propaganda.⁹⁷ When the Council of the EU decided to suspend the broadcast of the Russian State-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik News across the Union in March 2022, Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova explained this decision by declaring that freedom of speech must be protected but that it «cannot be abused to spread war propaganda»⁹⁸.\n\nGiven that some speech is already prohibited by international norms, there seems to be no need for a separate prohibition for disinformation that contains it. More pertinent is thus the question whether disinformation can be regulated in line with international standards on the right to freedom of expression, even if it does not contain speech that is *per se* unlawful under international law.

Thus, according to the Johannesburg Principles, a restriction on the freedom of expression is legitimate when it aims «to protect a country’s existence or its territorial integrity against the use or threat of force, or its capacity to respond to the use or threat of force, whether from an external source, such as a military threat, or an internal source, such as incitement to violent overthrow of the government.»102 Finally, the Joint Declaration on Freedom of Expression and «Fake News», Disinformation and Propaganda (hereinafter Joint Declaration on Disinformation), written conjointly by several regional human rights organizations, should also be considered as an important reference document.103 It stipulates for example that intermediaries should never be held liable for content posted on their platforms and that persons who merely redistribute false information (and thus lack the malign intent behind disinformation) ought not to be punished.104\n\nWhen applying the three-part test of the Human Rights Committee, it seems that a restriction on the freedom of speech to counter disinformation may fulfill at\n\n99 UN Commission on Human Rights, «The Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights», 28 September 1984, UN Doc.

    "Yannick Zerbe\n\nleast the two first conditions. Laws against disinformation can be – and in some parts of the world have been – adopted. The Syracus and Johannesburg principles stipulate that IHRL allows certain (temporary) restrictions on the freedom of speech if they are based on legitimate concerns about the protection of national security. Disinformation threatens various aspects of national security, I have argued that disinformation can threaten aspects of national security. One could also argue that prescriptive measures are necessary, as less intrusive measures – such as fact-finding bodies or media literacy campaigns – have proven to be insufficient.\n\nHowever, difficulties arise with regards to the condition of proportionality. According to the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom of expression must not be overbroad and only be applied for the purposes for which they were prescribed. One does not have to go to great lengths to find examples of national legislation containing vague prohibitions on the dissemination of «false information» with the pretext of safeguarding the population from the harm of disinformation. The Hungarian parliament, for example, adopted a law in March 2020 that allowed Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by emergency decree to respond to the public health crisis, which introduced jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation (i.e. without the intent to deceive) about the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.[105] Dozens of countries, particularly in Europe and Asia, have adopted laws imposing disproportionate criminal sanctions for spreading disinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.[106] Such «anti-fake news laws», according to the UN Human Rights Committee, «often unduly limit the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression».[107] The Human Rights Committee has thus held: The prosecution and punishment of journalists for the crime of publication of false news merely on the grounds, without more, that the news was false, [is a] clear violation of Article 19 of the [ICCPR].[108]\n\nThe central question thus turns to whether prescriptive measures against disinformation on grounds of national security can be proportional to the aim pursued. If the freedom of expression ought to be restricted, such a restriction must be justifiable by the protection of another right (right to health, right to life etc.), which ought to take precedence because it offers higher protection to more people. Thus, the Joint Declaration on Disinformation holds that blocking entire websites – as in the case of the EU's RT/Sputnik ban – is an extreme measure that can only be justified when\n\n105 SHAUN WALKER &amp; JENNIFER RANKIN, «Hungary passes law that will let Orbán rule by decree», The Guardian, 30 March 2020, available at: <https: 3pttt7f=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n106 Human Rights Watch, «Covid-19 Triggers Wave of Free Speech Abuse», 11 February 2021, <https: 3ddfxlk=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n107 UN Human Rights Committee, 19th Annual Report, October 1995, UN Doc.

    "Cyber-enabled International State-Sponsored Disinformation Operations\n\nprotecting a «legitimate public interest».¹⁰⁹ Given that the EU has argued that Russian disinformation with regard to its invasion of Ukraine threatens the security of the Union, a ban on two media outlets seems justifiable.\n\nFor further guidance on the proportionality of prescriptive countermeasures on disinformation one may want to turn to the jurisprudence of international courts. Most of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on disinformation rests on cases of hate speech and genocide denial, in which case the ECtHR has typically applied art. 17 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR).¹¹⁰ Dubbed the «abuse clause», art. 17 ECHR stipulates that the provisions of the Convention must not be abused to undermine the rights of others, for example by disseminating harmful information and ideas.¹¹¹ I argue that art. 17 ECtHR could be applied mutatis mutandis to disinformation, even in cases where the speech contained therein is not already unlawful per se. In fact, some disinformation fulfills the conditions of art. 17 ECtHR; it may constitute an abuse of a right (the freedom of expression), meant to harm the rights of others (right to health, right to life, right to fair and free elections etc.). While the innocent spreading of false information (misinformation) is protected by art. 19 ICCPR and art. 10 ECHR respectively, the intentional spread of false information meant to mentally or physically harm others should not be protected by the ECHR, especially when it is spread by automated bots, which are not subjects of human rights law.\n\nThe ECtHR has also declared that opinions are less susceptible of proof and that their protection must thus be more robust than the dissemination of false facts.¹¹² The ECtHR has thus established that the threshold to restrict State-sponsored disinformation that contains simply misleading information is higher than when faced with disinformation that includes verifiably false information.\n\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has also ruled on cases involving disinformation, notably in the Baltic Media Alliance case. Therein, the Court was faced with the decision of the Lithuanian Radio and Television Commission (LRTC) to require that NTV Mir Lithuania, a channel targeting the Russophone minority in the Baltic country, must broadcast exclusively in a pay-TV format.¹¹³ The LRTC had justified its decision on the grounds that the channel was spreading false information about the collaboration of Lithuania and Latvia with the Nazi regime during the Holocaust\n\n¹⁰⁹ OHCHR et al, supra n. 104, para. f).\n\n¹¹⁰ Art. 17 ECHR: «Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set forth herein or at their limitation to a greater extent than is provided for in the Convention.»\n\n¹¹¹ HANNES CANNIE &amp; DIRK VOORHOOF, «The Abuse Clause and Freedom of Expression in the European Human Rights Convention: An Added Value for Democracy and Human Rights Protection?», 29 Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2011), 54–83.\n\n¹¹² ECtHR, Lingens v Austria, Judgment, 8 July 1986, Appl.

A (lack of) consensus within the international community to regulate CISDOs?\n\nDisinformation has reinvigorated two contentious debates of international law discussed in this article: the limits of free speech when weighed against threats to national security and the extent of the principle of non-intervention. Similar to other areas of international law, the debate on disinformation has divided the international community into two camps: democratic and authoritarian States. Interestingly, however, the *opinio juris* on restrictions to speech and the limits of non-intervention has flipped with regards to disinformation. Democratic States, traditionally unwavering defenders of the norms of IHRL related to the freedom of expression and the media, have enacted measures that limit the enjoyment of such rights by foreign media (see EU’s RT ban). Furthermore, while authoritarian States have been proponents of an interpretation of the principle of non-intervention that limits foreign interference to a minimum, democratic States now see themselves confronted with the awkward prospect of defending an interpretation of international law which they have opposed for decades.\n\nSome Western States have formed an alliance to counter CISDOs outside of the UN. The EU is at the forefront of these efforts and has set up several entities to this end.¹¹⁷ Transatlantic initiatives to combat (primarily Russian) disinformation have\n\n¹¹⁴ Id., para. 79.\n¹¹⁵ See Art. 19 of said law: «1.

As a notable exception to the Western efforts to combat disinformation one may cite the International Code of Conduct for Information Security, a non-binding document from 2015 drafted by China and Russia together with several Eurasian countries at the UN.¹²⁰ Therein, the subscribing States pledged « [n]ot to use information and communications technologies and information and communications networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other States or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability ».¹²¹ While legitimate doubts may be expressed with regards to the genuine intentions of the subscribing States of the Code of Conduct (esp. Russia and China), the list of subscribing States further underscores the East-West narrative of modern-day information warfare. It may seem thus, that the chances of a future «Convention on the Prohibition of State-sponsored Disinformation» are precluded a priori because of the apparent East-West divide with regards to the dissemination of and the exposure to disinformation and the West's difficulty of positioning itself within the international law debate on the topic.\n\nHowever, there are some noteworthy intra-regional attempts at setting up rules to combat disinformation. The Joint Declaration referred to in the previous chapter drafted conjointly by regional organization from Europe, Africa and the Americas, is one of them. Another initiative, the International Partnership on Information and Democracy (IPID), initiated by the international NGO Reporters without Borders and led by France at the UN, also deserves mention.

How should international law regulate CISDOs?\n\nGiven the destructive aim and trust-eroding effect of State-sponsored disinformation, international law ought to provide an effective framework to counter it, especially since other countermeasures have so far not been successful in preventing disinformation. Furthermore, since CISDOs are by definition international and thus typically conducted from a foreign jurisdiction, national legislation is inadequate to deter or punish such operations. Moreover, current national anti-disinformation laws that focus on the author(s) behind disinformation operations typically treat such individuals as private agents and thereby equate State-sponsored disinformation with that of simple internet «trolls». This risks ignoring the wide-reaching and potentially devastating effect of CISDOs and does not address their root cause: the malicious behavior of the State instructing, organizing, or supporting these operations.\n\nThis article explained that current international law already governs CISDOs to a certain degree.

The international community ought to acknowledge that existing international law already guarantees the right to non-interference both at the macro-level, i.e. between States (principle of non-intervention), and at the individual level (freedom of opinion), and enforce these rights through *lex specialis*.\n\nIn order not to limit the freedom of speech and the media unduly and excessively, the purpose of any new international regime on State-sponsored disinformation should thus focus on the intent of the actor behind – and not the content of – disinformation. In fact, whether a given CISDO draws up conspiracy theories about the origin of Covid-19, diffuses claims about an alleged genocide in Eastern Ukraine or questions the legitimacy of a democratic election, the intent of the author remains the same: to inflict harm on the population and the nation by deceiving and dividing it.\n\nHRC Resolution 49/21 proves that the international community as a whole – and not just the Global North – has made a first important step toward recognizing the *sui generis* character of disinformation. It is by no means the first step, however, as the Correction and the Broadcasting Conventions document. These conventions, drafted 70 and 86 years ago respectively, show that the aggressive and deliberate dissemination of false information to the detriment of other States was a preoccupation of the international community long before the advent of modern technology. Unfortunately, these conventions, due to their limited scope of application are not up to the task of countering contemporary State-sponsored disinformation.\n\nBuilding on Resolution 49/21 and taking into account not only the adverse effect on human rights but also on international peace and security, States should strive for a comprehensive, legally binding text that outlaws international State-sponsored disinformation.[127] Such a treaty should acknowledge that, in a globalized world, States in their domestic and foreign policy invariably influence the policies of other States while making clear that the deliberate attempt to manipulate and harm a foreign population through disinformation constitutes an unlawful intervention within the *domaine réservé* of sovereign States. It should also highlight the influence of « disinfo-for-hire » corporations, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency, and prohibit that States simply outsource CISDOs to private actors, thereby obscuring attribution and escaping accountability.\n\n127 ZHAO, supra n. 36, at 51.\n\n33 SRIEL (2023)",
    "Yannick Zerbe\n\nWhile the top-down and State-centered lawmaking approach to international law is still predominant (and rightfully so), it does not sufficiently take into account the immense power and responsibility that private actors wield in cyberspace, especially when it comes to disinformation on social media. While multinational corporations cannot build trust among States, innovative multi-stakeholder co-regulatory approaches, such as the EU's Code of Practice on Disinformation¹²⁸, combine the technological expertise of corporations with the authority of nation-states and should thus be considered as a complement to a traditional treaty. Finally, if intra-regional consensus cannot be reached, regional treaties, or even bilateral commitments not to engage in aggressive informational practices, may still prove useful.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nThis article aimed at clarifying the role of international law with regard to CISDOs. It attempted to answer three central questions: whether CISDOs violate international law as it currently stands, what challenges complicate the response of international law to CISDOs and if and how international law should regulate them. I found that CISDOs may in fact violate several provisions of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention, the Broadcasting and Correction Conventions and various norms of IHRL and IHL. On the other hand, I have also shown that several characteristics of CISDOs limit the capacity of current international law to counter disinformation, namely the multitude of actors, including private corporations conducting such operations on behalf of States, and the associated difficulties of establishing legal attribution of cyberoperations to a State. Additionally, the limited extraterritorial effect of IHRL and the lack of clarity what countermeasures are proportional to respond to CISDOs on the national level, especially in light of international standards on the freedom of expression, constitute further obstacles that impede the regulation of disinformation. Furthermore, outdated conceptions of sovereignty still associated with physical borders do not sufficiently grasp means of intrusions in governmental functions via the cyber realm.\n\nFaced with these obstacles, I outlined potential solutions for improving the current situation. I called for an international convention to be drafted, which would serve as a trust-building exercise among States and complement the insufficient self-regulatory approaches that have so far been relied on with regard to CISDOs. In fact, while national legislation often aims to suppress information that has already been published and thus typically amounts to undesired censorship, international law is disposed to address the root cause of State-sponsored disinformation: the State\n\n¹²⁸ European Commission, «The 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation», available at: <https: 3n8fwlm=\"\" bit.ly=\"\">.\n\n33 SRIEL (2023)</https:>",

For such a treaty, co-regulatory approaches should be considered, for example by taking the EU's Code of Practice as a blueprint and expanding it beyond the European context and incorporating the obligation for co-regulatory commitments in the convention.\n\nIt is evident that re-interpreting the law of the 20th century will not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the 21st century. While new technologies have changed the disinformation game, the rules remain the same. Thus, as multilateral discussions about the regulation of cyberspace advance, the international community must also consider a new legal framework to govern CISDOs. In fact, given their potentially devastating yet subtle effects and wide reach, as well as their low intensity allowing them to escape the purview of current international law, CISDOs ought to be treated by international law as a sui generis category of cyberoperations.\n\n33 SRIEL (2023)",
