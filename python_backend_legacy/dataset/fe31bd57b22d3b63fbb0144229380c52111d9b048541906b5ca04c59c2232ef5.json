As a result, technology seems to have outpaced the law.\n\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\n\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different\n\n4. Oona A. Hathaway et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 CALIF. L. REV. 817, 820 (2012).\n5.

Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n\n## I. BACKGROUND\n\nCyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n\n7.

Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would\n\n12.

The intended effects of cyber attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyber attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.²²\n\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical.

Cyber-attacks do not cleanly fit within pre-existing international legal frameworks for holding states responsible.\n\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51\n\nIn general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n\n50.

Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\n\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N.

Charter, another potential set of international laws that may be applicable to cyber-attacks are those that enforce the principle of state responsibility. These laws allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n\n2. Laws enforcing the principle of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts: sovereignty, non-intervention, and due diligence.\n\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as \"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an \"internationally wrongful act\" if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's \"armed force\" element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n\n76. See G.A.

The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any . . . measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\n\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to\n\n80.

Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\n\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber-\n\n86.

Charter provides a very broad definition of \"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means \"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined \"armed attack\" as \"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\n\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of \"force\" applies to \"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to \"interruption of ... communication\" as \"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an \"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself.

Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\n\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an\n\n¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\n\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world,\n\n138.

Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\n\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber-\n\n144.

For clarity, the updated articles should state that \"territory\" includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad.

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\n\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\n\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues.

This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\n\niii.

The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n\n¹⁵⁸.

As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\n\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\n\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n\n163.

One argument is that which was applied to sovereignty: measure the damage through audience reach. However, while this provides a way to quantify a consequence, it provides no clarity for whether that consequence was “serious” or “adverse.” Who is to say that the cyber-influencing negatively impacted American minds? Who is to say that it made a noticeable difference at all? Even if millions of people were exposed to the attack, that is not dispositive of whether or not it impacted them or ultimately influenced the election or economy. Thus, as a result of these largely unquantifiable attributes, the duty of due diligence, even with modifications, like would still be inapplicable to cyber-attacks.\n\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n\n## III. CONCLUSION\n\nThe current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and\n\n¹⁶⁸.

The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\n\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of \"armed attack\" based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of \"territory\" is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term \"coercion\" to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results.

As a result, technology seems to have outpaced the law.\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different\n4. Oona A. Hathaway et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 CALIF. L. REV. 817, 820 (2012).\n5.

Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n## I. BACKGROUND\nCyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n7.

Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would\n12.

Typology: Cyber-attack, Cyber-warfare, &amp; Cyber-crime Defined.\nThere is currently no accepted consensus on the definition of \"cyber-warfare\" or \"cyber-attack,\" and many groups use a variety of terminology and definitions.¹⁸ As a general matter, however, \"cyber-warfare\" is often defined as \"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\"¹⁹ Cyber-warfare is carried out by means of \"cyber-attacks\".²⁰ Two main definitions of \"cyber-attack\" are important for this paper: (1) the United States government's definition, and (2) the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) definition.²¹\nThe U.S. government defines a \"cyber-attack\" as:\n16.

The intended effects of cyber attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyber attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.²²\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical. In contrast, the SCO broadly defines an “information war” as, in part, a “mass psychologic[al] brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take [sic] decisions in the interest of an opposing party.”²³ Furthermore, the SCO considers the\n22.

In 2011 and 2015, member states of the SCO submitted its International Code of Conduct for Information Security (the “Code”) to the UN General Assembly.³² The SCO claims this Code is intended “to push forward the international debate on international norms on information security, and help\n29.

Therefore, aside from simply protecting its own domestic interests, the U.S. also has an interest in promoting and protecting freedom of expression and association around the world.\nIn addition to the domestic human rights concerns, the SCO’s positions also raise questions about how its member countries view cyber-attacks targeting foreign political elections. Specifically, could they justify election interference under the theory that certain foreign elections equate to the spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states?”³⁶ There is some indication they already are.³⁷ Several member states have a history of interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the elections of other countries with which they disagree either socially, politically, or economically.³⁸ For example, in July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers who were found to have\n33.

In fact, there are indications that China may be the next perpetrator.⁴¹ Specifically, China’s motives look very similar to Russia’s in 2016 and 2018⁴², and China has shown unique signs of a long-term scheme to weaken the United States and become what its leadership has called a “cyber superpower.”⁴³ Thus, the importance of the U.S. leading conversations on changes in\n39.

Similarly, China’s motives include: (1) to gather intelligence that benefits China amidst escalating trade tensions with the U.S., (2) to influence operations in support of their military and political goals to become a world super power, and (3) to continue to build their cyber-capabilities for future use in order to become an economic leader and a cyber superpower.

Cyber-attacks do not cleanly fit within pre-existing international legal frameworks for holding states responsible.\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51\nIn general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n50. See Hathaway et al., supra note 4, at 817, 840 (explaining that cyberattacks are relatively new and therefore the drafters of legal frameworks were unable to predict them).\n51.

The U.N. Charter\nArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that member states must “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”57 Although some have argued that Article 2(4) provides a broad prohibition on force, including acts like economic and political coercion,58 the overwhelming majority of commentators today consider “force” in Article 2(4) to be synonymous with “armed force.”59 However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”60 To date, no state has ever formally argued that a cyber-attack is a prohibited “use of force” per Article 2(4).61 However, the increase in cyber-attacks in recent years increases the likelihood that states may at some point begin\n55.

Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, and (2) actions that constitute “self-defense” under Article 51.⁶³ Under Chapter VII, the U.N. Security Council can label threats or uses of force as illegal and then may choose the appropriate response measure.⁶⁴ Chapter VII gives the Council three options for courses of action in response to an illegal threat or use of force: (1) Article 39, (2) Article 41, and (3) Article 42.⁶⁵ With regard to Articles 39 and 41, the Council’s decision is expected to be grounded in an intention to restore international peace and security.⁶⁶ Article 39 allows the Council make a non-binding, permissive authorization (military or non-military).⁶⁷ Article 41 provides a list of binding, non-military enforcement measures, including the interruption of railroad, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other communications, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations.⁶⁸ Notable for the cyber-attack context, Article 41 specifically refers to an “interruption of . . . communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”⁶⁹\nLastly, Article 42 allows the Council to authorize military action pursuant to a special agreement made between U.N. member states.⁷⁰ As long as the U.N. Security Council has not yet acted under one of these articles, Article 51 allows states to use\n⁶².

Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.\n71. U.N. Charter art. 51 (“Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”).\n72.

Charter, another potential set of international laws that may be applicable to cyber-attacks are those that enforce the principle of state responsibility. These laws allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n2. Laws enforcing the principle of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts: sovereignty, non-intervention, and due diligence.\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as \"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an \"internationally wrongful act\" if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's \"armed force\" element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n76. See G.A. Res. 56/83 (Dec. 12, 2001) (annexing the Articles on State Responsibility to a U.N. resolution).\n77. Id. art. 2.\n78.

Schmitt, ed., 2017) [hereinafter TALLINN MANUAL 2.0].\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nSecond, principals of non-intervention are applied through a two-part rule. The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any . . . measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to\n80.

Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber-\n86.

Cyber-tampering: hacking.\nCyber tampering, commonly known as \"hacking,\" is the more familiar form of cyber-attack.⁹⁴ Cyber tampering usually includes tricking people into providing account information and passwords, or downloading malware that infects their computer, such as through phishing e-mails that contain malware-ridden hyperlinks.⁹⁵ Hacking focused on influencing political elections can occur in the form of breaches of voting machines, voter lists, or other systems related to the election process, such as those that contain campaign information.⁹⁶\nThere is significant evidence that foreign actors have attempted to hack U.S. voting systems in the past.⁹⁷ In July 2018, for example, a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign was unsuccessfully targeted by hackers affiliated with Russia's intelligence agency by sending phishing emails to staffers in her office in attempts to steal passwords and access sensitive information related to the campaign.⁹⁸ On an even larger scale, in February 2018 the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers had successfully hacked into voter registration lists in several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.⁹⁹ Even if election-related citizen information is being legally obtained, such as through an authorized data collection by the government (i.e., law-enforcement systems) or a corporation (i.e., credit card and banking companies), this information can nonetheless be hacked\n⁹³.

ANALYSIS\nA. Amendments that need to be made to the pre-existing legal frameworks in order to be applicable to cyber-attacks.\nDue to the lack of foresight regarding cyber-attacks at the time the pre-existing international law was drafted, it is no surprise that none of them fully encompass the attributes of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare. However, there are a few changes that can be made to these laws that would make them more applicable to cyber-attacks.\n1.

Charter provides a very broad definition of \"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means \"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined \"armed attack\" as \"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of \"force\" applies to \"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to \"interruption of ... communication\" as \"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an \"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself. Thus, perhaps the aggressive\n128. U.N. Charter art. 2, ¶ 4.\n129. Hathaway et al., supra note 4, at 842.\n130. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an\n¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world,\n138.

Charter, this issue of attribution also comes up under the laws of state responsibility. These laws, discussed next, allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n2. Modifying the laws of state responsibility to better address cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing.\ni. Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber-\n144.

For clarity, the updated articles should state that \"territory\" includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's\nespionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty).

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ\n150. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, ¶ 205 (June 27).\n151.

Res. 36/103, annex (Dec. 9, 1981) (stating that non-intervention includes (1) “the right of States and peoples to . . . use their information media in order to promote their political, social, economic and cultural interests and aspirations,” (2) “the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States,” and (3) “[t]he right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other states or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, co-operation and friendly relations among states and nations.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nhere, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\niii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure.\n¹⁵⁴. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 317 (stating that international law does not have a strict definition of coercion).\n¹⁵⁵. Sander, supra note 78, at 24 (discussing the difficulties of concluding cyber influence on elections as a prohibited form of intervention because traditionally, international law results from examples of physical actions).\n¹⁵⁶. See, e.g., Bowett, supra note 81, at 248–49 (explaining that coercive actions are broad in that they usually entail economic influence or impact and that the line between economic and political motives is unclear, so if political influence is allowed through coercion, then regulation of economic coercion is unlikely).\n¹⁵⁷. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker).\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451\nAs written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context).\n¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge).\n¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks).\n¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”).\n¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nThe second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n163.

One argument is that which was applied to sovereignty: measure the damage through audience reach. However, while this provides a way to quantify a consequence, it provides no clarity for whether that consequence was “serious” or “adverse.” Who is to say that the cyber-influencing negatively impacted American minds? Who is to say that it made a noticeable difference at all? Even if millions of people were exposed to the attack, that is not dispositive of whether or not it impacted them or ultimately influenced the election or economy. Thus, as a result of these largely unquantifiable attributes, the duty of due diligence, even with modifications, like would still be inapplicable to cyber-attacks.\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n## III. CONCLUSION\nThe current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and\n¹⁶⁸.

In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nessentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of \"armed attack\" based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of \"territory\" is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term \"coercion\" to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up.",

CONCLUSION...453 # INTRODUCTION War in its traditional sense has existed for thousands of years.¹ As a result, there is a well-established set of international laws governing warfare between nations that have developed over time.² In recent decades, however, countries have begun utilizing cyber-space to attack other countries, sometimes simply for information but other times to intentionally disrupt society, perhaps to a political or economic end.³ Because this “cyber-warfare” is vastly different in several respects from traditional\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] types of cyber-attacks that states utilize, specifically focusing on attacks on elections. Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n## I. BACKGROUND Cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nTo date, no multilateral international conventions on cyber operations have been created, and there is disagreement between western countries and countries like China and Russia as to how the law should be changed.¹² The most significant gathering to date has been the U.N. Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] lead to destabilization.¹⁶ The main issue has been that, although most of the states involved in these meetings agree on the language of international law, they fundamentally disagree as to what that language means and whether or not it applies to cyber-attacks.¹⁷ ## A. Typology: Cyber-attack, Cyber-warfare, &amp; Cyber-crime Defined.\nThere is currently no accepted consensus on the definition of\"cyber-warfare\"or\"cyber-attack,\"and many groups use a variety of terminology and definitions.¹⁸ As a general matter, however,\"cyber-warfare\"is often defined as\"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\"¹⁹ Cyber-warfare is carried out by means of\"cyber-attacks\".²⁰ Two main definitions of\"cyber-attack\"are important for this paper: (1) the United States government's definition, and (2) the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) definition.²¹ The U.S. government defines a\"cyber-attack\"as:\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical. In contrast, the SCO broadly defines an “information war” as, in part, a “mass psychologic[al] brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take [sic] decisions in the interest of an opposing party.”²³ Furthermore, the SCO considers the HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states” to be one of the main threats to information security.²⁴ Thus, by focusing on attacks on social and political stability, the SCO definition seems to focus more on broad destabilization than just cyber system disruption like the U.S. definition.\nThis confined definition has negative implications on international humanitarian law.²⁵ By suggesting that harm to social, political, and economic systems might justify a government response, the SCO’s definition runs the risk of allowing governments to suppress the political speech of dissenters by arguing that such dissent destabilizes society and the state.²⁶ While the First Amendment protects freedom of expression in the U.S., acceptance of the SCO’s definition in countries without the same protections would create a serious human rights threat to citizens of those countries.²⁷ The U.S. definition of cyber-attack does not leave room for these types of expression restriction justifications because it is mainly focused on the protection of data and computer systems, and less on social and political impact.²⁸ This is the main reason it is imperative that changes to international law be made in favor of the U.S. definition rather than the SCO definition. The SCO’s core membership includes countries with legal and regulatory regimes that tolerate (if not 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 427 authorize or require) pervasive human rights abuses.²⁹ Thus, the SCO’s definition may have even been designed with precisely this type of pre-planned justification in mind.³⁰ In June 2019, for example, China conducted a “denial of service” attack on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service that was being used by Hong Kong protestors, to disrupt their communications and coordination of the recent pro-free speech protests that have erupted in Hong Kong.³¹ Given the current lack of consensus on terminology and applicability of cyber-attacks to international law, the U.S. and SCO have been competing for their respective view to be adopted internationally. In 2011 and 2015, member states of the SCO submitted its International Code of Conduct for Information Security (the “Code”) to the UN General Assembly.³² The SCO claims this Code is intended “to push forward the international debate on international norms on information security, and help HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] forge an early consensus on this issue.”³³ Critics of the Code, however, note that it raises serious human rights concerns because its language prioritizes state sovereignty and territorial dominance in cyberspace above all other concerns.³⁴ This language, along with the above-mentioned trends exhibited by the SCO, including its broad, means-based definition of “information warfare,”³⁵ indicates that its member countries would likely be able to legally violate human rights via the use of cyber-technology were this Code adopted internationally. Therefore, aside from simply protecting its own domestic interests, the U.S. also has an interest in promoting and protecting freedom of expression and association around the world.\nIn addition to the domestic human rights concerns, the SCO’s positions also raise questions about how its member countries view cyber-attacks targeting foreign political elections. Specifically, could they justify election interference under the theory that certain foreign elections equate to the spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states?”³⁶ There is some indication they already are.³⁷ Several member states have a history of interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the elections of other countries with which they disagree either socially, politically, or economically.³⁸ For example, in July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers who were found to have 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 429 carried out large-scale cyber-attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign just before the 2016 presidential election by targeting election infrastructure and local election officials.³⁹ Similarly, in February 2019, U.S. Cyber Command, a branch of the Department of Defense (DOD), announced that during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections a Russian company involved in information operations against the U.S. during the 2016 presidential election had tried to access election information.⁴⁰ There has been no indication that similar attempts on U.S. electoral systems will dissipate in the near future. In fact, there are indications that China may be the next perpetrator.⁴¹ Specifically, China’s motives look very similar to Russia’s in 2016 and 2018⁴², and China has shown unique signs of a long-term scheme to weaken the United States and become what its leadership has called a “cyber superpower.”⁴³ Thus, the importance of the U.S. leading conversations on changes in HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] international law as it relates to cyber-attacks is not only crucial for the international community in general but may be of use to the U.S. as these threats increase.^[44]^ Lastly,\"cyber-crimes\"are another form of cyber operations.^[45]^ Cyber-crime also has no uniformly accepted definition but has certain characteristics that most countries seem to agree upon.^[46]^ Cyber-crimes are generally recognized as computer-based illegal acts, violating either domestic or international criminal law, but unlike\"cyber-attacks,\"most cyber-crimes involve non-state actors and do not have a political or national security purpose.^[47]^ The most common examples in the U.S. and Europe include online piracy, distribution, and possession of child pornography, and common forms of hacking of personal data such as credit card information.^[48]^ These types of cyber activities occur below the level of a\"use of force,\"and have not been addressed in detail by international laws but rather are left mostly to individual states to legislate.^[49]^ Thus, this paper will focus on cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks, rather than cyber-crimes.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51 In general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Charter.55 Other aspects of jus ad bellum are derived from customary law and its accompanying international jurisprudence, and thus will be discussed separately.56 They all, however, seem to pose their own problems in the context of cyber-attacks.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that member states must “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”57 Although some have argued that Article 2(4) provides a broad prohibition on force, including acts like economic and political coercion,58 the overwhelming majority of commentators today consider “force” in Article 2(4) to be synonymous with “armed force.”59 However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”60 To date, no state has ever formally argued that a cyber-attack is a prohibited “use of force” per Article 2(4).61 However, the increase in cyber-attacks in recent years increases the likelihood that states may at some point begin 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 433 to respond to cyber-attacks with conventional military means if no international framework governing cyber-attacks is agreed upon.⁶² There are only two generally agreed upon exceptions to Article 2(4)’s prohibition of the threat or use of force: (1) actions authorized by the U.N. Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, and (2) actions that constitute “self-defense” under Article 51.⁶³ Under Chapter VII, the U.N. Security Council can label threats or uses of force as illegal and then may choose the appropriate response measure.⁶⁴ Chapter VII gives the Council three options for courses of action in response to an illegal threat or use of force: (1) Article 39, (2) Article 41, and (3) Article 42.⁶⁵ With regard to Articles 39 and 41, the Council’s decision is expected to be grounded in an intention to restore international peace and security.⁶⁶ Article 39 allows the Council make a non-binding, permissive authorization (military or non-military).⁶⁷ Article 41 provides a list of binding, non-military enforcement measures, including the interruption of railroad, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other communications, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations.⁶⁸ Notable for the cyber-attack context, Article 41 specifically refers to an “interruption of... communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”⁶⁹ Lastly, Article 42 allows the Council to authorize military action pursuant to a special agreement made between U.N. member states.⁷⁰ As long as the U.N. Security Council has not yet acted under one of these articles, Article 51 allows states to use ⁶². See U.S. DEP’T OF DEFENSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO SECTION 934 OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, at 2 (2011) (declaring that the United States reserves the right to respond to cyber-attacks using “all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic”).\n⁶³.

Charter art. 42.; DIMEGLIO ET AL., supra note 52, at 33.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] self-defense in the event of an “armed attack.”71 The ICJ has defined “armed attack” as “the most grave form of the use of force.”72 This language, which will be discussed further later, is not always easily applied in the cyber-attack context, given its implicit focus on physical force through the use of weapons.\nAdditionally, as will be discussed later, even if these definitions could be molded to fit the characteristics of cyber-attacks, an inherent issue may still linger: attribution. Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as\"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an\"internationally wrongful act\"if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's\"armed force\"element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Second, principals of non-intervention are applied through a two-part rule. The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any... measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 437 the inconspicuous nature of cyber-attacks and the resources it takes to combat large-scale attacks.\nOn their face, neither the U.N. Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] attack operations often use a combination of these strategies to accomplish their goals.⁹³ Cyber tampering, commonly known as\"hacking,\"is the more familiar form of cyber-attack.⁹⁴ Cyber tampering usually includes tricking people into providing account information and passwords, or downloading malware that infects their computer, such as through phishing e-mails that contain malware-ridden hyperlinks.⁹⁵ Hacking focused on influencing political elections can occur in the form of breaches of voting machines, voter lists, or other systems related to the election process, such as those that contain campaign information.⁹⁶ There is significant evidence that foreign actors have attempted to hack U.S. voting systems in the past.⁹⁷ In July 2018, for example, a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign was unsuccessfully targeted by hackers affiliated with Russia's intelligence agency by sending phishing emails to staffers in her office in attempts to steal passwords and access sensitive information related to the campaign.⁹⁸ On an even larger scale, in February 2018 the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers had successfully hacked into voter registration lists in several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.⁹⁹ Even if election-related citizen information is being legally obtained, such as through an authorized data collection by the government (i.e., law-enforcement systems) or a corporation (i.e., credit card and banking companies), this information can nonetheless be hacked ⁹³.

Cyber-influencing: doxing and information operations.\nCyber-influencing includes “doxing,” and information operations.¹⁰² “Doxing” occurs when a hacker infiltrates a computer system in order to leak non-public information.¹⁰³ In the political context, the purpose of doxing is to influence peoples’ reputations and alter the outcomes of elections as a result.¹⁰⁴ Doxing can take shape in two forms: traditional whistleblowing (exposing wrongdoing to promote the public good), or strategic hacks (leaking of material that is in the interest of the hacker, but not necessarily in the interest of the public).¹⁰⁵ The June 2013 leaks by Edward Snowden, a former systems administrator with the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing documents showing evidence of cyber-espionage conducted by the U.S. against Chinese targets, is an example of traditional\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] whistleblowing, with someone from the “inside” exposing information with intentions to benefit the public.¹⁰⁶ The leaking of Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails prior to the 2016 presidential election by Russian hackers is an example of a strategic hack.¹⁰⁷ In the author’s opinion, strategic hacking is the more dangerous of the two types of doxing because the information leaked is more likely to be “tainted,” meaning doctored or wholly fake.¹⁰⁸ Because election interference is almost never done with the public good in mind, it falls squarely under strategic hacking.\nCyber-influencing also includes “trolling” and what is commonly called “fake news,” collectively called “information operations.”¹⁰⁹ Trolling involves attackers causing disruption, or triggering or exacerbating conflict on the internet.¹¹⁰ Trolls often use threats of doxing and intimidation, including threats of death, sexual assault, harm to one’s family, or reputational damage, and often target journalists, political dissenters, and members of ¹⁰⁶. See Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3. Although the platform “Wikileaks” might be confused as a form of traditional whistleblowing, Wikileaks is often used as a platform for strategic hackers to dump leaked material anonymously. See, e.g., id. (discussing when the Department of Homeland Security identified Russia as responsible for the 2016 DNC email hacking and acknowledging that Russia then use Wikileaks to disseminate the emails obtained in the hack); see also Ethan Lozano et al., Wikileaks &amp; Whistleblowing: Digital Information Leakage and Its Impact on Society, STANFORD UNIV., https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs181/projects/2010-11/WikiLeaks/online.html (last visited Feb. 5, 2021) (discussing the differences between traditional offline leaks and online leaks through websites like WikiLeaks).\n¹⁰⁷. “Strategic hacking” is not to be confused with cyber-tampering (“hacking”). Strategic hacking is simply the name of a type of cyber-influencing. See Sander, supra note 78, at 9 (classifying “strategic hacking” as a subset of “doxing,” itself a type of cyber-influencing).\n¹⁰⁸.

Specifically, attackers can use them to inflame political and cultural polarization by disseminating extreme viewpoints, while simultaneously downplaying their dangerous effects under a guise of light-hearted joking on the internet.¹¹⁵ Memes can specifically favor one candidate or party over the other, or can simply act as a tool for creating division within a party or country.¹¹⁶ In October 2019, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook, announced that the company had recently caught Russian and Iranian backed hackers creating fake accounts, mostly on Instagram, and sharing original meme HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] content.¹¹⁷ Some of the memes were designed to generally create divisiveness between the Democratic party, and some to specifically promote the re-election of Donald Trump.¹¹⁸ Zuckerberg also stated that China had made attempts to influence operations via Facebook, but that Facebook's security team had been able to step in before much was seen by users.¹¹⁹ In contrast, the Russian and Iranian efforts reached large audiences before being detected.¹²⁰ Cyber-influencing also includes the spread of misinformation, more commonly known as\"fake news.\"¹²¹ Although election experts have long worried about the electoral effects of the uninformed voter, cyber influencing tactics like fake news has increased the number of potentially misinformed voters.¹²² This category, much like trolling, often uses fake social media accounts, memes, and other organic forms of disinformation spread by users.¹²³ The type of medium used is very important to the effectiveness of fake news. Specifically, the amount of influence a piece of misinformation has can also be artificially expanded through the use of algorithms, automation, and\"targeting.\"¹²⁴ These strategies allow the attacker to hone in their message to certain groups of people and to spread the information in strategic ways.¹²⁵\"Bots,\"for example, can be used to suppress 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 443 already popular content that they do not want to spread, or to amplify content that attackers want to make seem more popular (which to make things even more difficult to track, can make things actually more popular).¹²⁶ Similarly, “sock puppets,” which are fake accounts run by humans that enable attackers to spread information behind a hidden or misrepresented identity, can be used to make certain information seem more authentic by impersonating trusted sources.¹²⁷ Because of the intangible, untraceable, and overall immeasurable nature of cyber-attacks, the use of these cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing tactics by foreign actors is not punishable under the laws as written. Therefore, I suggest that certain modifications be made to the language of these international laws in order to make them more applicable to cyber-attacks, specially to the tactics used to influence elections.\n## II. ANALYSIS A. Amendments that need to be made to the pre-existing legal frameworks in order to be applicable to cyber-attacks.\nDue to the lack of foresight regarding cyber-attacks at the time the pre-existing international law was drafted, it is no surprise that none of them fully encompass the attributes of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare. However, there are a few changes that can be made to these laws that would make them more applicable to cyber-attacks.\n\nResolution and Hyper-Personalization, TOW CTR.

Charter provides a very broad definition of\"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means\"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined\"armed attack\"as\"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of\"force\"applies to\"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to\"interruption of... communication\"as\"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an\"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself. Thus, perhaps the aggressive 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 445 intent of a cyber-attack would be enough to classify it as an “armed attack” under Article 2(4), arguing that cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing are technological “weapons.”\nBut is there any indication that the international community sees it this way? Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an ¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world, 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 447 may simply be unavoidable. In addition to being an obstacle to applicability under the U.N. Charter, this issue of attribution also comes up under the laws of state responsibility. These laws, discussed next, allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n\ni. Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] space actually requires physical components within a state's territory to function, such as fiber-optic cables, copper wires, microwave relay towers, satellite transponders, and internet routers.¹⁴⁹ Thus, to address the physical territory element, the simplest fix would be to codify this practice into the text of the Articles on State Responsibility. For clarity, the updated articles should state that\"territory\"includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's espionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty). However, it should be noted that other countries that spoke out against these NSA leaks did not explicitly invoke sovereignty as a ground and thus it should not be assumed that cyber-attacks are universally considered breaches of territorial sovereignty.

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] here, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\niii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure.\n¹⁵⁴. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 317 (stating that international law does not have a strict definition of coercion).\n¹⁵⁵. Sander, supra note 78, at 24 (discussing the difficulties of concluding cyber influence on elections as a prohibited form of intervention because traditionally, international law results from examples of physical actions).\n¹⁵⁶. See, e.g., Bowett, supra note 81, at 248–49 (explaining that coercive actions are broad in that they usually entail economic influence or impact and that the line between economic and political motives is unclear, so if political influence is allowed through coercion, then regulation of economic coercion is unlikely).\n¹⁵⁷. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker).\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451 As written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context).\n¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge).\n¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks).\n¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”).\n¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] The second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n## III. CONCLUSION The current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and ¹⁶⁸. See Sander, supra note 78, at 38 (mentioning breaches of privacy as a potential result of cyber doxing operations). As a side note, interference with power grids is not as unlikely as it may sound. In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] essentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of\"armed attack\"based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of\"territory\"is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term\"coercion\"to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up.",

CONCLUSION...453 # INTRODUCTION War in its traditional sense has existed for thousands of years.¹ As a result, there is a well-established set of international laws governing warfare between nations that have developed over time.² In recent decades, however, countries have begun utilizing cyber-space to attack other countries, sometimes simply for information but other times to intentionally disrupt society, perhaps to a political or economic end.³ Because this “cyber-warfare” is vastly different in several respects from traditional\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] types of cyber-attacks that states utilize, specifically focusing on attacks on elections. Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n## I. BACKGROUND Cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nTo date, no multilateral international conventions on cyber operations have been created, and there is disagreement between western countries and countries like China and Russia as to how the law should be changed.¹² The most significant gathering to date has been the U.N. Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] lead to destabilization.¹⁶ The main issue has been that, although most of the states involved in these meetings agree on the language of international law, they fundamentally disagree as to what that language means and whether or not it applies to cyber-attacks.¹⁷ ## A. Typology: Cyber-attack, Cyber-warfare, &amp; Cyber-crime Defined.\nThere is currently no accepted consensus on the definition of\"cyber-warfare\"or\"cyber-attack,\"and many groups use a variety of terminology and definitions.¹⁸ As a general matter, however,\"cyber-warfare\"is often defined as\"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\"¹⁹ Cyber-warfare is carried out by means of\"cyber-attacks\".²⁰ Two main definitions of\"cyber-attack\"are important for this paper: (1) the United States government's definition, and (2) the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) definition.²¹ The U.S. government defines a\"cyber-attack\"as:\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical. In contrast, the SCO broadly defines an “information war” as, in part, a “mass psychologic[al] brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take [sic] decisions in the interest of an opposing party.”²³ Furthermore, the SCO considers the HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states” to be one of the main threats to information security.²⁴ Thus, by focusing on attacks on social and political stability, the SCO definition seems to focus more on broad destabilization than just cyber system disruption like the U.S. definition.\nThis confined definition has negative implications on international humanitarian law.²⁵ By suggesting that harm to social, political, and economic systems might justify a government response, the SCO’s definition runs the risk of allowing governments to suppress the political speech of dissenters by arguing that such dissent destabilizes society and the state.²⁶ While the First Amendment protects freedom of expression in the U.S., acceptance of the SCO’s definition in countries without the same protections would create a serious human rights threat to citizens of those countries.²⁷ The U.S. definition of cyber-attack does not leave room for these types of expression restriction justifications because it is mainly focused on the protection of data and computer systems, and less on social and political impact.²⁸ This is the main reason it is imperative that changes to international law be made in favor of the U.S. definition rather than the SCO definition. The SCO’s core membership includes countries with legal and regulatory regimes that tolerate (if not 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 427 authorize or require) pervasive human rights abuses.²⁹ Thus, the SCO’s definition may have even been designed with precisely this type of pre-planned justification in mind.³⁰ In June 2019, for example, China conducted a “denial of service” attack on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service that was being used by Hong Kong protestors, to disrupt their communications and coordination of the recent pro-free speech protests that have erupted in Hong Kong.³¹ Given the current lack of consensus on terminology and applicability of cyber-attacks to international law, the U.S. and SCO have been competing for their respective view to be adopted internationally. In 2011 and 2015, member states of the SCO submitted its International Code of Conduct for Information Security (the “Code”) to the UN General Assembly.³² The SCO claims this Code is intended “to push forward the international debate on international norms on information security, and help HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] forge an early consensus on this issue.”³³ Critics of the Code, however, note that it raises serious human rights concerns because its language prioritizes state sovereignty and territorial dominance in cyberspace above all other concerns.³⁴ This language, along with the above-mentioned trends exhibited by the SCO, including its broad, means-based definition of “information warfare,”³⁵ indicates that its member countries would likely be able to legally violate human rights via the use of cyber-technology were this Code adopted internationally. Therefore, aside from simply protecting its own domestic interests, the U.S. also has an interest in promoting and protecting freedom of expression and association around the world.\nIn addition to the domestic human rights concerns, the SCO’s positions also raise questions about how its member countries view cyber-attacks targeting foreign political elections. Specifically, could they justify election interference under the theory that certain foreign elections equate to the spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states?”³⁶ There is some indication they already are.³⁷ Several member states have a history of interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the elections of other countries with which they disagree either socially, politically, or economically.³⁸ For example, in July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers who were found to have 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 429 carried out large-scale cyber-attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign just before the 2016 presidential election by targeting election infrastructure and local election officials.³⁹ Similarly, in February 2019, U.S. Cyber Command, a branch of the Department of Defense (DOD), announced that during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections a Russian company involved in information operations against the U.S. during the 2016 presidential election had tried to access election information.⁴⁰ There has been no indication that similar attempts on U.S. electoral systems will dissipate in the near future. In fact, there are indications that China may be the next perpetrator.⁴¹ Specifically, China’s motives look very similar to Russia’s in 2016 and 2018⁴², and China has shown unique signs of a long-term scheme to weaken the United States and become what its leadership has called a “cyber superpower.”⁴³ Thus, the importance of the U.S. leading conversations on changes in HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] international law as it relates to cyber-attacks is not only crucial for the international community in general but may be of use to the U.S. as these threats increase.^[44]^ Lastly,\"cyber-crimes\"are another form of cyber operations.^[45]^ Cyber-crime also has no uniformly accepted definition but has certain characteristics that most countries seem to agree upon.^[46]^ Cyber-crimes are generally recognized as computer-based illegal acts, violating either domestic or international criminal law, but unlike\"cyber-attacks,\"most cyber-crimes involve non-state actors and do not have a political or national security purpose.^[47]^ The most common examples in the U.S. and Europe include online piracy, distribution, and possession of child pornography, and common forms of hacking of personal data such as credit card information.^[48]^ These types of cyber activities occur below the level of a\"use of force,\"and have not been addressed in detail by international laws but rather are left mostly to individual states to legislate.^[49]^ Thus, this paper will focus on cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks, rather than cyber-crimes.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51 In general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Charter.55 Other aspects of jus ad bellum are derived from customary law and its accompanying international jurisprudence, and thus will be discussed separately.56 They all, however, seem to pose their own problems in the context of cyber-attacks.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that member states must “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”57 Although some have argued that Article 2(4) provides a broad prohibition on force, including acts like economic and political coercion,58 the overwhelming majority of commentators today consider “force” in Article 2(4) to be synonymous with “armed force.”59 However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”60 To date, no state has ever formally argued that a cyber-attack is a prohibited “use of force” per Article 2(4).61 However, the increase in cyber-attacks in recent years increases the likelihood that states may at some point begin 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 433 to respond to cyber-attacks with conventional military means if no international framework governing cyber-attacks is agreed upon.⁶² There are only two generally agreed upon exceptions to Article 2(4)’s prohibition of the threat or use of force: (1) actions authorized by the U.N. Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, and (2) actions that constitute “self-defense” under Article 51.⁶³ Under Chapter VII, the U.N. Security Council can label threats or uses of force as illegal and then may choose the appropriate response measure.⁶⁴ Chapter VII gives the Council three options for courses of action in response to an illegal threat or use of force: (1) Article 39, (2) Article 41, and (3) Article 42.⁶⁵ With regard to Articles 39 and 41, the Council’s decision is expected to be grounded in an intention to restore international peace and security.⁶⁶ Article 39 allows the Council make a non-binding, permissive authorization (military or non-military).⁶⁷ Article 41 provides a list of binding, non-military enforcement measures, including the interruption of railroad, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other communications, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations.⁶⁸ Notable for the cyber-attack context, Article 41 specifically refers to an “interruption of... communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”⁶⁹ Lastly, Article 42 allows the Council to authorize military action pursuant to a special agreement made between U.N. member states.⁷⁰ As long as the U.N. Security Council has not yet acted under one of these articles, Article 51 allows states to use ⁶². See U.S. DEP’T OF DEFENSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO SECTION 934 OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, at 2 (2011) (declaring that the United States reserves the right to respond to cyber-attacks using “all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic”).\n⁶³.

Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as\"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an\"internationally wrongful act\"if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's\"armed force\"element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Second, principals of non-intervention are applied through a two-part rule. The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any... measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 437 the inconspicuous nature of cyber-attacks and the resources it takes to combat large-scale attacks.\nOn their face, neither the U.N. Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] attack operations often use a combination of these strategies to accomplish their goals.⁹³ Cyber tampering, commonly known as\"hacking,\"is the more familiar form of cyber-attack.⁹⁴ Cyber tampering usually includes tricking people into providing account information and passwords, or downloading malware that infects their computer, such as through phishing e-mails that contain malware-ridden hyperlinks.⁹⁵ Hacking focused on influencing political elections can occur in the form of breaches of voting machines, voter lists, or other systems related to the election process, such as those that contain campaign information.⁹⁶ There is significant evidence that foreign actors have attempted to hack U.S. voting systems in the past.⁹⁷ In July 2018, for example, a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign was unsuccessfully targeted by hackers affiliated with Russia's intelligence agency by sending phishing emails to staffers in her office in attempts to steal passwords and access sensitive information related to the campaign.⁹⁸ On an even larger scale, in February 2018 the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers had successfully hacked into voter registration lists in several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.⁹⁹ Even if election-related citizen information is being legally obtained, such as through an authorized data collection by the government (i.e., law-enforcement systems) or a corporation (i.e., credit card and banking companies), this information can nonetheless be hacked ⁹³.

Cyber-influencing: doxing and information operations.\nCyber-influencing includes “doxing,” and information operations.¹⁰² “Doxing” occurs when a hacker infiltrates a computer system in order to leak non-public information.¹⁰³ In the political context, the purpose of doxing is to influence peoples’ reputations and alter the outcomes of elections as a result.¹⁰⁴ Doxing can take shape in two forms: traditional whistleblowing (exposing wrongdoing to promote the public good), or strategic hacks (leaking of material that is in the interest of the hacker, but not necessarily in the interest of the public).¹⁰⁵ The June 2013 leaks by Edward Snowden, a former systems administrator with the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing documents showing evidence of cyber-espionage conducted by the U.S. against Chinese targets, is an example of traditional\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] whistleblowing, with someone from the “inside” exposing information with intentions to benefit the public.¹⁰⁶ The leaking of Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails prior to the 2016 presidential election by Russian hackers is an example of a strategic hack.¹⁰⁷ In the author’s opinion, strategic hacking is the more dangerous of the two types of doxing because the information leaked is more likely to be “tainted,” meaning doctored or wholly fake.¹⁰⁸ Because election interference is almost never done with the public good in mind, it falls squarely under strategic hacking.\nCyber-influencing also includes “trolling” and what is commonly called “fake news,” collectively called “information operations.”¹⁰⁹ Trolling involves attackers causing disruption, or triggering or exacerbating conflict on the internet.¹¹⁰ Trolls often use threats of doxing and intimidation, including threats of death, sexual assault, harm to one’s family, or reputational damage, and often target journalists, political dissenters, and members of ¹⁰⁶. See Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3. Although the platform “Wikileaks” might be confused as a form of traditional whistleblowing, Wikileaks is often used as a platform for strategic hackers to dump leaked material anonymously. See, e.g., id. (discussing when the Department of Homeland Security identified Russia as responsible for the 2016 DNC email hacking and acknowledging that Russia then use Wikileaks to disseminate the emails obtained in the hack); see also Ethan Lozano et al., Wikileaks &amp; Whistleblowing: Digital Information Leakage and Its Impact on Society, STANFORD UNIV., https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs181/projects/2010-11/WikiLeaks/online.html (last visited Feb. 5, 2021) (discussing the differences between traditional offline leaks and online leaks through websites like WikiLeaks).\n¹⁰⁷. “Strategic hacking” is not to be confused with cyber-tampering (“hacking”). Strategic hacking is simply the name of a type of cyber-influencing. See Sander, supra note 78, at 9 (classifying “strategic hacking” as a subset of “doxing,” itself a type of cyber-influencing).\n¹⁰⁸. TENOVE ET AL., supra note 87, at 14; see also Adam Hulcoop et al., Tainted Leaks: Disinformation and Phishing With a Russian Nexus, THE CITIZEN LAB (May 25, 2017), https://citizenlab.ca/2017/05/tainted-leaks-disinformation-phish/ (defining tainted leaking as the “deliberate seeding of false information within a larger set of authentically stolen data”).\n¹⁰⁹.

Specifically, attackers can use them to inflame political and cultural polarization by disseminating extreme viewpoints, while simultaneously downplaying their dangerous effects under a guise of light-hearted joking on the internet.¹¹⁵ Memes can specifically favor one candidate or party over the other, or can simply act as a tool for creating division within a party or country.¹¹⁶ In October 2019, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook, announced that the company had recently caught Russian and Iranian backed hackers creating fake accounts, mostly on Instagram, and sharing original meme HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] content.¹¹⁷ Some of the memes were designed to generally create divisiveness between the Democratic party, and some to specifically promote the re-election of Donald Trump.¹¹⁸ Zuckerberg also stated that China had made attempts to influence operations via Facebook, but that Facebook's security team had been able to step in before much was seen by users.¹¹⁹ In contrast, the Russian and Iranian efforts reached large audiences before being detected.¹²⁰ Cyber-influencing also includes the spread of misinformation, more commonly known as\"fake news.\"¹²¹ Although election experts have long worried about the electoral effects of the uninformed voter, cyber influencing tactics like fake news has increased the number of potentially misinformed voters.¹²² This category, much like trolling, often uses fake social media accounts, memes, and other organic forms of disinformation spread by users.¹²³ The type of medium used is very important to the effectiveness of fake news. Specifically, the amount of influence a piece of misinformation has can also be artificially expanded through the use of algorithms, automation, and\"targeting.\"¹²⁴ These strategies allow the attacker to hone in their message to certain groups of people and to spread the information in strategic ways.¹²⁵\"Bots,\"for example, can be used to suppress 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 443 already popular content that they do not want to spread, or to amplify content that attackers want to make seem more popular (which to make things even more difficult to track, can make things actually more popular).¹²⁶ Similarly, “sock puppets,” which are fake accounts run by humans that enable attackers to spread information behind a hidden or misrepresented identity, can be used to make certain information seem more authentic by impersonating trusted sources.¹²⁷ Because of the intangible, untraceable, and overall immeasurable nature of cyber-attacks, the use of these cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing tactics by foreign actors is not punishable under the laws as written. Therefore, I suggest that certain modifications be made to the language of these international laws in order to make them more applicable to cyber-attacks, specially to the tactics used to influence elections.\n## II. ANALYSIS A. Amendments that need to be made to the pre-existing legal frameworks in order to be applicable to cyber-attacks.\nDue to the lack of foresight regarding cyber-attacks at the time the pre-existing international law was drafted, it is no surprise that none of them fully encompass the attributes of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare. However, there are a few changes that can be made to these laws that would make them more applicable to cyber-attacks.\n\nResolution and Hyper-Personalization, TOW CTR.

Charter provides a very broad definition of\"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means\"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined\"armed attack\"as\"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of\"force\"applies to\"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to\"interruption of... communication\"as\"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an\"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself. Thus, perhaps the aggressive 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 445 intent of a cyber-attack would be enough to classify it as an “armed attack” under Article 2(4), arguing that cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing are technological “weapons.”\nBut is there any indication that the international community sees it this way? Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an ¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world, 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 447 may simply be unavoidable. In addition to being an obstacle to applicability under the U.N. Charter, this issue of attribution also comes up under the laws of state responsibility. These laws, discussed next, allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n\ni. Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] space actually requires physical components within a state's territory to function, such as fiber-optic cables, copper wires, microwave relay towers, satellite transponders, and internet routers.¹⁴⁹ Thus, to address the physical territory element, the simplest fix would be to codify this practice into the text of the Articles on State Responsibility. For clarity, the updated articles should state that\"territory\"includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's espionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty). However, it should be noted that other countries that spoke out against these NSA leaks did not explicitly invoke sovereignty as a ground and thus it should not be assumed that cyber-attacks are universally considered breaches of territorial sovereignty.

Franzese, *Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Can it Exist?*, 64 AIR FORCE L. REV., no. 1, 2009, at 1, 12.\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 449 important to discuss their individual weaknesses nonetheless because they may be applicable in different scenarios.\nii. Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] here, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\niii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure.\n¹⁵⁴. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 317 (stating that international law does not have a strict definition of coercion).\n¹⁵⁵. Sander, supra note 78, at 24 (discussing the difficulties of concluding cyber influence on elections as a prohibited form of intervention because traditionally, international law results from examples of physical actions).\n¹⁵⁶. See, e.g., Bowett, supra note 81, at 248–49 (explaining that coercive actions are broad in that they usually entail economic influence or impact and that the line between economic and political motives is unclear, so if political influence is allowed through coercion, then regulation of economic coercion is unlikely).\n¹⁵⁷. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker).\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451 As written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context).\n¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge).\n¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks).\n¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”).\n¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] The second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n## III. CONCLUSION The current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and ¹⁶⁸. See Sander, supra note 78, at 38 (mentioning breaches of privacy as a potential result of cyber doxing operations). As a side note, interference with power grids is not as unlikely as it may sound. In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] essentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of\"armed attack\"based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of\"territory\"is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term\"coercion\"to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up.",

As a result, technology seems to have outpaced the law. The United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks.

BACKGROUND Cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter",

Cyber-attacks do not cleanly fit within pre-existing international legal frameworks for holding states responsible. Drawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51 In general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.",

HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] self-defense in the event of an “armed attack.”71 The ICJ has defined “armed attack” as “the most grave form of the use of force.”72 This language, which will be discussed further later, is not always easily applied in the cyber-attack context, given its implicit focus on physical force through the use of weapons. Additionally, as will be discussed later, even if these definitions could be molded to fit the characteristics of cyber-attacks, an inherent issue may still linger: attribution. Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law. Thus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.",

The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any . . . measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks. Third, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to",

Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others. ## C. Types of cyber-attacks. Attackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber-",

Cyber-influencing also includes “trolling” and what is commonly called “fake news,” collectively called “information operations.”¹⁰⁹ Trolling involves attackers causing disruption, or triggering or exacerbating conflict on the internet.¹¹⁰ Trolls often use threats of doxing and intimidation, including threats of death, sexual assault, harm to one’s family, or reputational damage, and often target journalists, political dissenters, and members of ¹⁰⁶.

Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering. However, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an ¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply. But even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world,",

For clarity, the updated articles should state that \"territory\" includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's espionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty). However, it should be noted that other countries that spoke out against these NSA leaks did not explicitly invoke sovereignty as a ground and thus it should not be assumed that cyber-attacks are universally considered breaches of territorial sovereignty.

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.” Although they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly. The first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ",

HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] here, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk. iii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure. ¹⁵⁴.

Sander, supra note 78, at 24 (discussing the difficulties of concluding cyber influence on elections as a prohibited form of intervention because traditionally, international law results from examples of physical actions). ¹⁵⁶. See, e.g., Bowett, supra note 81, at 248–49 (explaining that coercive actions are broad in that they usually entail economic influence or impact and that the line between economic and political motives is unclear, so if political influence is allowed through coercion, then regulation of economic coercion is unlikely). ¹⁵⁷. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker). 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451 As written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations. ¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context). ¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge). ¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks). ¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”). ¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”). HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] The second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack. The third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity. The next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and",

One argument is that which was applied to sovereignty: measure the damage through audience reach. However, while this provides a way to quantify a consequence, it provides no clarity for whether that consequence was “serious” or “adverse.” Who is to say that the cyber-influencing negatively impacted American minds? Who is to say that it made a noticeable difference at all? Even if millions of people were exposed to the attack, that is not dispositive of whether or not it impacted them or ultimately influenced the election or economy. Thus, as a result of these largely unquantifiable attributes, the duty of due diligence, even with modifications, like would still be inapplicable to cyber-attacks. Overall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks. ## III. CONCLUSION The current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and ¹⁶⁸. See Sander, supra note 78, at 38 (mentioning breaches of privacy as a potential result of cyber doxing operations). As a side note, interference with power grids is not as unlikely as it may sound. In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3. HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] essentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world. This paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of \"armed attack\" based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of \"territory\" is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term \"coercion\" to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up."

The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any . . . measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks. Third, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to"

CONCLUSION...453 # INTRODUCTION War in its traditional sense has existed for thousands of years.¹ As a result, there is a well-established set of international laws governing warfare between nations that have developed over time.² In recent decades, however, countries have begun utilizing cyber-space to attack other countries, sometimes simply for information but other times to intentionally disrupt society, perhaps to a political or economic end.³ Because this “cyber-warfare” is vastly different in several respects from traditional\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] types of cyber-attacks that states utilize, specifically focusing on attacks on elections. Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n## I. BACKGROUND Cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nTo date, no multilateral international conventions on cyber operations have been created, and there is disagreement between western countries and countries like China and Russia as to how the law should be changed.¹² The most significant gathering to date has been the U.N. Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] lead to destabilization.¹⁶ The main issue has been that, although most of the states involved in these meetings agree on the language of international law, they fundamentally disagree as to what that language means and whether or not it applies to cyber-attacks.¹⁷ ## A. Typology: Cyber-attack, Cyber-warfare, &amp; Cyber-crime Defined.\nThere is currently no accepted consensus on the definition of\"cyber-warfare\"or\"cyber-attack,\"and many groups use a variety of terminology and definitions.¹⁸ As a general matter, however,\"cyber-warfare\"is often defined as\"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\"¹⁹ Cyber-warfare is carried out by means of\"cyber-attacks\".²⁰ Two main definitions of\"cyber-attack\"are important for this paper: (1) the United States government's definition, and (2) the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) definition.²¹ The U.S. government defines a\"cyber-attack\"as:\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical. In contrast, the SCO broadly defines an “information war” as, in part, a “mass psychologic[al] brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take [sic] decisions in the interest of an opposing party.”²³ Furthermore, the SCO considers the HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states” to be one of the main threats to information security.²⁴ Thus, by focusing on attacks on social and political stability, the SCO definition seems to focus more on broad destabilization than just cyber system disruption like the U.S. definition.\nThis confined definition has negative implications on international humanitarian law.²⁵ By suggesting that harm to social, political, and economic systems might justify a government response, the SCO’s definition runs the risk of allowing governments to suppress the political speech of dissenters by arguing that such dissent destabilizes society and the state.²⁶ While the First Amendment protects freedom of expression in the U.S., acceptance of the SCO’s definition in countries without the same protections would create a serious human rights threat to citizens of those countries.²⁷ The U.S. definition of cyber-attack does not leave room for these types of expression restriction justifications because it is mainly focused on the protection of data and computer systems, and less on social and political impact.²⁸ This is the main reason it is imperative that changes to international law be made in favor of the U.S. definition rather than the SCO definition. The SCO’s core membership includes countries with legal and regulatory regimes that tolerate (if not 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 427 authorize or require) pervasive human rights abuses.²⁹ Thus, the SCO’s definition may have even been designed with precisely this type of pre-planned justification in mind.³⁰ In June 2019, for example, China conducted a “denial of service” attack on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service that was being used by Hong Kong protestors, to disrupt their communications and coordination of the recent pro-free speech protests that have erupted in Hong Kong.³¹ Given the current lack of consensus on terminology and applicability of cyber-attacks to international law, the U.S. and SCO have been competing for their respective view to be adopted internationally. In 2011 and 2015, member states of the SCO submitted its International Code of Conduct for Information Security (the “Code”) to the UN General Assembly.³² The SCO claims this Code is intended “to push forward the international debate on international norms on information security, and help HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] forge an early consensus on this issue.”³³ Critics of the Code, however, note that it raises serious human rights concerns because its language prioritizes state sovereignty and territorial dominance in cyberspace above all other concerns.³⁴ This language, along with the above-mentioned trends exhibited by the SCO, including its broad, means-based definition of “information warfare,”³⁵ indicates that its member countries would likely be able to legally violate human rights via the use of cyber-technology were this Code adopted internationally. Therefore, aside from simply protecting its own domestic interests, the U.S. also has an interest in promoting and protecting freedom of expression and association around the world.\nIn addition to the domestic human rights concerns, the SCO’s positions also raise questions about how its member countries view cyber-attacks targeting foreign political elections. Specifically, could they justify election interference under the theory that certain foreign elections equate to the spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states?”³⁶ There is some indication they already are.³⁷ Several member states have a history of interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the elections of other countries with which they disagree either socially, politically, or economically.³⁸ For example, in July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers who were found to have 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 429 carried out large-scale cyber-attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign just before the 2016 presidential election by targeting election infrastructure and local election officials.³⁹ Similarly, in February 2019, U.S. Cyber Command, a branch of the Department of Defense (DOD), announced that during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections a Russian company involved in information operations against the U.S. during the 2016 presidential election had tried to access election information.⁴⁰ There has been no indication that similar attempts on U.S. electoral systems will dissipate in the near future. In fact, there are indications that China may be the next perpetrator.⁴¹ Specifically, China’s motives look very similar to Russia’s in 2016 and 2018⁴², and China has shown unique signs of a long-term scheme to weaken the United States and become what its leadership has called a “cyber superpower.”⁴³ Thus, the importance of the U.S. leading conversations on changes in HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] international law as it relates to cyber-attacks is not only crucial for the international community in general but may be of use to the U.S. as these threats increase.^[44]^ Lastly,\"cyber-crimes\"are another form of cyber operations.^[45]^ Cyber-crime also has no uniformly accepted definition but has certain characteristics that most countries seem to agree upon.^[46]^ Cyber-crimes are generally recognized as computer-based illegal acts, violating either domestic or international criminal law, but unlike\"cyber-attacks,\"most cyber-crimes involve non-state actors and do not have a political or national security purpose.^[47]^ The most common examples in the U.S. and Europe include online piracy, distribution, and possession of child pornography, and common forms of hacking of personal data such as credit card information.^[48]^ These types of cyber activities occur below the level of a\"use of force,\"and have not been addressed in detail by international laws but rather are left mostly to individual states to legislate.^[49]^ Thus, this paper will focus on cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks, rather than cyber-crimes.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51 In general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Charter.55 Other aspects of jus ad bellum are derived from customary law and its accompanying international jurisprudence, and thus will be discussed separately.56 They all, however, seem to pose their own problems in the context of cyber-attacks.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that member states must “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”57 Although some have argued that Article 2(4) provides a broad prohibition on force, including acts like economic and political coercion,58 the overwhelming majority of commentators today consider “force” in Article 2(4) to be synonymous with “armed force.”59 However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”60 To date, no state has ever formally argued that a cyber-attack is a prohibited “use of force” per Article 2(4).61 However, the increase in cyber-attacks in recent years increases the likelihood that states may at some point begin 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 433 to respond to cyber-attacks with conventional military means if no international framework governing cyber-attacks is agreed upon.⁶² There are only two generally agreed upon exceptions to Article 2(4)’s prohibition of the threat or use of force: (1) actions authorized by the U.N. Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, and (2) actions that constitute “self-defense” under Article 51.⁶³ Under Chapter VII, the U.N. Security Council can label threats or uses of force as illegal and then may choose the appropriate response measure.⁶⁴ Chapter VII gives the Council three options for courses of action in response to an illegal threat or use of force: (1) Article 39, (2) Article 41, and (3) Article 42.⁶⁵ With regard to Articles 39 and 41, the Council’s decision is expected to be grounded in an intention to restore international peace and security.⁶⁶ Article 39 allows the Council make a non-binding, permissive authorization (military or non-military).⁶⁷ Article 41 provides a list of binding, non-military enforcement measures, including the interruption of railroad, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other communications, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations.⁶⁸ Notable for the cyber-attack context, Article 41 specifically refers to an “interruption of... communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”⁶⁹ Lastly, Article 42 allows the Council to authorize military action pursuant to a special agreement made between U.N. member states.⁷⁰ As long as the U.N. Security Council has not yet acted under one of these articles, Article 51 allows states to use ⁶².

Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as\"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an\"internationally wrongful act\"if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's\"armed force\"element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Second, principals of non-intervention are applied through a two-part rule. The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any... measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 437 the inconspicuous nature of cyber-attacks and the resources it takes to combat large-scale attacks.\nOn their face, neither the U.N. Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] attack operations often use a combination of these strategies to accomplish their goals.⁹³ Cyber tampering, commonly known as\"hacking,\"is the more familiar form of cyber-attack.⁹⁴ Cyber tampering usually includes tricking people into providing account information and passwords, or downloading malware that infects their computer, such as through phishing e-mails that contain malware-ridden hyperlinks.⁹⁵ Hacking focused on influencing political elections can occur in the form of breaches of voting machines, voter lists, or other systems related to the election process, such as those that contain campaign information.⁹⁶ There is significant evidence that foreign actors have attempted to hack U.S. voting systems in the past.⁹⁷ In July 2018, for example, a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign was unsuccessfully targeted by hackers affiliated with Russia's intelligence agency by sending phishing emails to staffers in her office in attempts to steal passwords and access sensitive information related to the campaign.⁹⁸ On an even larger scale, in February 2018 the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers had successfully hacked into voter registration lists in several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.⁹⁹ Even if election-related citizen information is being legally obtained, such as through an authorized data collection by the government (i.e., law-enforcement systems) or a corporation (i.e., credit card and banking companies), this information can nonetheless be hacked ⁹³.

Cyber-influencing: doxing and information operations.\nCyber-influencing includes “doxing,” and information operations.¹⁰² “Doxing” occurs when a hacker infiltrates a computer system in order to leak non-public information.¹⁰³ In the political context, the purpose of doxing is to influence peoples’ reputations and alter the outcomes of elections as a result.¹⁰⁴ Doxing can take shape in two forms: traditional whistleblowing (exposing wrongdoing to promote the public good), or strategic hacks (leaking of material that is in the interest of the hacker, but not necessarily in the interest of the public).¹⁰⁵ The June 2013 leaks by Edward Snowden, a former systems administrator with the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing documents showing evidence of cyber-espionage conducted by the U.S. against Chinese targets, is an example of traditional\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] whistleblowing, with someone from the “inside” exposing information with intentions to benefit the public.¹⁰⁶ The leaking of Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails prior to the 2016 presidential election by Russian hackers is an example of a strategic hack.¹⁰⁷ In the author’s opinion, strategic hacking is the more dangerous of the two types of doxing because the information leaked is more likely to be “tainted,” meaning doctored or wholly fake.¹⁰⁸ Because election interference is almost never done with the public good in mind, it falls squarely under strategic hacking.\nCyber-influencing also includes “trolling” and what is commonly called “fake news,” collectively called “information operations.”¹⁰⁹ Trolling involves attackers causing disruption, or triggering or exacerbating conflict on the internet.¹¹⁰ Trolls often use threats of doxing and intimidation, including threats of death, sexual assault, harm to one’s family, or reputational damage, and often target journalists, political dissenters, and members of ¹⁰⁶. See Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3. Although the platform “Wikileaks” might be confused as a form of traditional whistleblowing, Wikileaks is often used as a platform for strategic hackers to dump leaked material anonymously. See, e.g., id. (discussing when the Department of Homeland Security identified Russia as responsible for the 2016 DNC email hacking and acknowledging that Russia then use Wikileaks to disseminate the emails obtained in the hack); see also Ethan Lozano et al., Wikileaks &amp; Whistleblowing: Digital Information Leakage and Its Impact on Society, STANFORD UNIV., https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs181/projects/2010-11/WikiLeaks/online.html (last visited Feb. 5, 2021) (discussing the differences between traditional offline leaks and online leaks through websites like WikiLeaks).\n¹⁰⁷. “Strategic hacking” is not to be confused with cyber-tampering (“hacking”). Strategic hacking is simply the name of a type of cyber-influencing. See Sander, supra note 78, at 9 (classifying “strategic hacking” as a subset of “doxing,” itself a type of cyber-influencing).\n¹⁰⁸.

Specifically, attackers can use them to inflame political and cultural polarization by disseminating extreme viewpoints, while simultaneously downplaying their dangerous effects under a guise of light-hearted joking on the internet.¹¹⁵ Memes can specifically favor one candidate or party over the other, or can simply act as a tool for creating division within a party or country.¹¹⁶ In October 2019, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook, announced that the company had recently caught Russian and Iranian backed hackers creating fake accounts, mostly on Instagram, and sharing original meme HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] content.¹¹⁷ Some of the memes were designed to generally create divisiveness between the Democratic party, and some to specifically promote the re-election of Donald Trump.¹¹⁸ Zuckerberg also stated that China had made attempts to influence operations via Facebook, but that Facebook's security team had been able to step in before much was seen by users.¹¹⁹ In contrast, the Russian and Iranian efforts reached large audiences before being detected.¹²⁰ Cyber-influencing also includes the spread of misinformation, more commonly known as\"fake news.\"¹²¹ Although election experts have long worried about the electoral effects of the uninformed voter, cyber influencing tactics like fake news has increased the number of potentially misinformed voters.¹²² This category, much like trolling, often uses fake social media accounts, memes, and other organic forms of disinformation spread by users.¹²³ The type of medium used is very important to the effectiveness of fake news. Specifically, the amount of influence a piece of misinformation has can also be artificially expanded through the use of algorithms, automation, and\"targeting.\"¹²⁴ These strategies allow the attacker to hone in their message to certain groups of people and to spread the information in strategic ways.¹²⁵\"Bots,\"for example, can be used to suppress 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 443 already popular content that they do not want to spread, or to amplify content that attackers want to make seem more popular (which to make things even more difficult to track, can make things actually more popular).¹²⁶ Similarly, “sock puppets,” which are fake accounts run by humans that enable attackers to spread information behind a hidden or misrepresented identity, can be used to make certain information seem more authentic by impersonating trusted sources.¹²⁷ Because of the intangible, untraceable, and overall immeasurable nature of cyber-attacks, the use of these cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing tactics by foreign actors is not punishable under the laws as written. Therefore, I suggest that certain modifications be made to the language of these international laws in order to make them more applicable to cyber-attacks, specially to the tactics used to influence elections.\n## II. ANALYSIS A. Amendments that need to be made to the pre-existing legal frameworks in order to be applicable to cyber-attacks.\nDue to the lack of foresight regarding cyber-attacks at the time the pre-existing international law was drafted, it is no surprise that none of them fully encompass the attributes of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare. However, there are a few changes that can be made to these laws that would make them more applicable to cyber-attacks.\n\nResolution and Hyper-Personalization, TOW CTR.

Charter provides a very broad definition of\"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means\"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined\"armed attack\"as\"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of\"force\"applies to\"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to\"interruption of... communication\"as\"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an\"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself. Thus, perhaps the aggressive 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 445 intent of a cyber-attack would be enough to classify it as an “armed attack” under Article 2(4), arguing that cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing are technological “weapons.”\nBut is there any indication that the international community sees it this way? Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an ¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world, 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 447 may simply be unavoidable. In addition to being an obstacle to applicability under the U.N. Charter, this issue of attribution also comes up under the laws of state responsibility. These laws, discussed next, allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n\ni. Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] space actually requires physical components within a state's territory to function, such as fiber-optic cables, copper wires, microwave relay towers, satellite transponders, and internet routers.¹⁴⁹ Thus, to address the physical territory element, the simplest fix would be to codify this practice into the text of the Articles on State Responsibility. For clarity, the updated articles should state that\"territory\"includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's espionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty). However, it should be noted that other countries that spoke out against these NSA leaks did not explicitly invoke sovereignty as a ground and thus it should not be assumed that cyber-attacks are universally considered breaches of territorial sovereignty.

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] here, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\niii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure.\n¹⁵⁴.

See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker).\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451 As written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context).\n¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge).\n¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks).\n¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”).\n¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] The second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n## III. CONCLUSION The current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and ¹⁶⁸. See Sander, supra note 78, at 38 (mentioning breaches of privacy as a potential result of cyber doxing operations). As a side note, interference with power grids is not as unlikely as it may sound. In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] essentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of\"armed attack\"based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of\"territory\"is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term\"coercion\"to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up."

Cyber-attacks do not cleanly fit within pre-existing international legal frameworks for holding states responsible. Drawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51 In general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N."

CONCLUSION ...453\n# INTRODUCTION\nWar in its traditional sense has existed for thousands of years.¹ As a result, there is a well-established set of international laws governing warfare between nations that have developed over time.² In recent decades, however, countries have begun utilizing cyber-space to attack other countries, sometimes simply for information but other times to intentionally disrupt society, perhaps to a political or economic end.³ Because this “cyber-warfare” is vastly different in several respects from traditional\n1.

As a result, technology seems to have outpaced the law.\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different\n4. Oona A. Hathaway et al., The Law of Cyber-Attack, 100 CALIF. L. REV. 817, 820 (2012).\n5.

Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n## I. BACKGROUND\nCyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n7.

Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would\n12.

The intended effects of cyber attack are not necessarily limited to the targeted computer systems or data themselves – for instance, attacks on computer systems which are intended to degrade or destroy infrastructure or C2 capability. A cyber attack may use intermediate delivery vehicles including peripheral devices, electronic transmitters, embedded code, or human operators. The activation or effect of a cyber attack may be widely separated temporally and geographically from the delivery.²²\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical. In contrast, the SCO broadly defines an “information war” as, in part, a “mass psychologic[al] brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take [sic] decisions in the interest of an opposing party.”²³ Furthermore, the SCO considers the\n22.

Therefore, aside from simply protecting its own domestic interests, the U.S. also has an interest in promoting and protecting freedom of expression and association around the world.\nIn addition to the domestic human rights concerns, the SCO’s positions also raise questions about how its member countries view cyber-attacks targeting foreign political elections. Specifically, could they justify election interference under the theory that certain foreign elections equate to the spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states?”³⁶ There is some indication they already are.³⁷ Several member states have a history of interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the elections of other countries with which they disagree either socially, politically, or economically.³⁸ For example, in July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers who were found to have\n33.

Similarly, China’s motives include: (1) to gather intelligence that benefits China amidst escalating trade tensions with the U.S., (2) to influence operations in support of their military and political goals to become a world super power, and (3) to continue to build their cyber-capabilities for future use in order to become an economic leader and a cyber superpower.

Cyber-attacks do not cleanly fit within pre-existing international legal frameworks for holding states responsible.\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51\nIn general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n50.

The U.N. Charter\nArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that member states must “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”57 Although some have argued that Article 2(4) provides a broad prohibition on force, including acts like economic and political coercion,58 the overwhelming majority of commentators today consider “force” in Article 2(4) to be synonymous with “armed force.”59 However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”60 To date, no state has ever formally argued that a cyber-attack is a prohibited “use of force” per Article 2(4).61 However, the increase in cyber-attacks in recent years increases the likelihood that states may at some point begin\n55.

Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, and (2) actions that constitute “self-defense” under Article 51.⁶³ Under Chapter VII, the U.N. Security Council can label threats or uses of force as illegal and then may choose the appropriate response measure.⁶⁴ Chapter VII gives the Council three options for courses of action in response to an illegal threat or use of force: (1) Article 39, (2) Article 41, and (3) Article 42.⁶⁵ With regard to Articles 39 and 41, the Council’s decision is expected to be grounded in an intention to restore international peace and security.⁶⁶ Article 39 allows the Council make a non-binding, permissive authorization (military or non-military).⁶⁷ Article 41 provides a list of binding, non-military enforcement measures, including the interruption of railroad, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other communications, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations.⁶⁸ Notable for the cyber-attack context, Article 41 specifically refers to an “interruption of . . . communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”⁶⁹\nLastly, Article 42 allows the Council to authorize military action pursuant to a special agreement made between U.N. member states.⁷⁰ As long as the U.N.

Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.\n71. U.N.

Charter, another potential set of international laws that may be applicable to cyber-attacks are those that enforce the principle of state responsibility. These laws allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n2. Laws enforcing the principle of state responsibility for internationally wrongful acts: sovereignty, non-intervention, and due diligence.\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as \"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an \"internationally wrongful act\" if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's \"armed force\" element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n76. See G.A.

The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any . . . measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to\n80.

Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber-\n86.

Cyber-tampering: hacking.\nCyber tampering, commonly known as \"hacking,\" is the more familiar form of cyber-attack.⁹⁴ Cyber tampering usually includes tricking people into providing account information and passwords, or downloading malware that infects their computer, such as through phishing e-mails that contain malware-ridden hyperlinks.⁹⁵ Hacking focused on influencing political elections can occur in the form of breaches of voting machines, voter lists, or other systems related to the election process, such as those that contain campaign information.⁹⁶\nThere is significant evidence that foreign actors have attempted to hack U.S. voting systems in the past.⁹⁷ In July 2018, for example, a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign was unsuccessfully targeted by hackers affiliated with Russia's intelligence agency by sending phishing emails to staffers in her office in attempts to steal passwords and access sensitive information related to the campaign.⁹⁸ On an even larger scale, in February 2018 the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers had successfully hacked into voter registration lists in several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.⁹⁹ Even if election-related citizen information is being legally obtained, such as through an authorized data collection by the government (i.e., law-enforcement systems) or a corporation (i.e., credit card and banking companies), this information can nonetheless be hacked\n⁹³.

Therefore, I suggest that certain modifications be made to the language of these international laws in order to make them more applicable to cyber-attacks, specially to the tactics used to influence elections.\n## II. ANALYSIS\nA. Amendments that need to be made to the pre-existing legal frameworks in order to be applicable to cyber-attacks.\nDue to the lack of foresight regarding cyber-attacks at the time the pre-existing international law was drafted, it is no surprise that none of them fully encompass the attributes of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare. However, there are a few changes that can be made to these laws that would make them more applicable to cyber-attacks.\n1.

Charter provides a very broad definition of \"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means \"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined \"armed attack\" as \"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of \"force\" applies to \"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to \"interruption of ... communication\" as \"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an \"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself. Thus, perhaps the aggressive\n128. U.N. Charter art. 2, ¶ 4.\n129. Hathaway et al., supra note 4, at 842.\n130. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an\n¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection. Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location. Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state. Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken. However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes. These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world,\n138. See Larry Greenemeier, Seeking Address: Why Cyber Attacks Are So Difficult to Trace Back to Hackers, SCI. AM.

Charter, this issue of attribution also comes up under the laws of state responsibility. These laws, discussed next, allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n2. Modifying the laws of state responsibility to better address cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing.\ni. Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber-\n144.

For clarity, the updated articles should state that \"territory\" includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's\nespionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty). However, it should be noted that other countries that spoke out against these NSA leaks did not explicitly invoke sovereignty as a ground and thus it should not be assumed that cyber-attacks are universally considered breaches of territorial sovereignty.

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ\n150. Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v. U.S.), Judgment, 1986 I.C.J. 14, ¶ 205 (June 27).\n151. See Nicar. v. U.S., 1986 I.C.J. ¶ 205; see TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 315.\n152. Nicar. v. U.S., 1986 I.C.J. ¶ 205; see TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 315.\n153. See G.A. Res. 36/103, annex (Dec. 9, 1981) (stating that non-intervention includes (1) “the right of States and peoples to . . . use their information media in order to promote their political, social, economic and cultural interests and aspirations,” (2) “the duty of a State to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other States,” and (3) “[t]he right and duty of States to combat, within their constitutional prerogatives, the dissemination of false or distorted news which can be interpreted as interference in the internal affairs of other states or as being harmful to the promotion of peace, co-operation and friendly relations among states and nations.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nhere, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\niii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure.\n¹⁵⁴. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 317 (stating that international law does not have a strict definition of coercion).\n¹⁵⁵. Sander, supra note 78, at 24 (discussing the difficulties of concluding cyber influence on elections as a prohibited form of intervention because traditionally, international law results from examples of physical actions).\n¹⁵⁶. See, e.g., Bowett, supra note 81, at 248–49 (explaining that coercive actions are broad in that they usually entail economic influence or impact and that the line between economic and political motives is unclear, so if political influence is allowed through coercion, then regulation of economic coercion is unlikely).\n¹⁵⁷. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker).\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451\nAs written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context).\n¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge).\n¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks).\n¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”).\n¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nThe second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n163.

One argument is that which was applied to sovereignty: measure the damage through audience reach. However, while this provides a way to quantify a consequence, it provides no clarity for whether that consequence was “serious” or “adverse.” Who is to say that the cyber-influencing negatively impacted American minds? Who is to say that it made a noticeable difference at all? Even if millions of people were exposed to the attack, that is not dispositive of whether or not it impacted them or ultimately influenced the election or economy. Thus, as a result of these largely unquantifiable attributes, the duty of due diligence, even with modifications, like would still be inapplicable to cyber-attacks.\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n## III. CONCLUSION\nThe current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and\n¹⁶⁸. See Sander, supra note 78, at 38 (mentioning breaches of privacy as a potential result of cyber doxing operations). As a side note, interference with power grids is not as unlikely as it may sound. In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\n[Vol. 43:3]\nessentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of \"armed attack\" based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of \"territory\" is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term \"coercion\" to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up."

CONCLUSION...453 # INTRODUCTION War in its traditional sense has existed for thousands of years.¹ As a result, there is a well-established set of international laws governing warfare between nations that have developed over time.² In recent decades, however, countries have begun utilizing cyber-space to attack other countries, sometimes simply for information but other times to intentionally disrupt society, perhaps to a political or economic end.³ Because this “cyber-warfare” is vastly different in several respects from traditional\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe United States is frequently targeted in these attacks, and cyber-attacks committed against the U.S. are now becoming not only more frequent, but also more complex.⁵ Thus, it is imperative that the U.S. work with the international community to create clear and consistent international laws that could also apply to cyber-attacks. Without such guidelines, countries (“states”) cannot be held legally responsible by the international community for the effects of cyber-attacks. Although cyber-attacks are usually less physical than traditional acts of war, cyber-attacks can result in both physical damage (like power-grid hacking) and infrastructure damage (such as influencing a country’s political culture and electoral outcomes).⁶ Therefore, they can be just as destructive as traditional war and should not be ignored.\nFirst, this paper will introduce the pre-existing terminology and international legal frameworks relevant to cyber-warfare as well as briefly discuss the current state of international discussions on this very topic. Second, it will discuss the different HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] types of cyber-attacks that states utilize, specifically focusing on attacks on elections. Third, it will point out the shortcomings of pre-existing international law when applied to cyber-attacks, and recommend how these laws should be modified in order to fill these important gaps.\n## I. BACKGROUND Cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare do not occur on a physical battlefield. Rather, they occur in cyberspace—an intangible electronic space with no physical boundaries.7 Because those that drafted the international laws of war did not contemplate this type of warfare, these pre-existing laws are largely incompatible with cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare.8 Thus, it is imperative that countries come together to create a more effective legal framework, with the United States leading the way.9 As will be discussed below, there are several competing views on how the law should be changed, and this paper will address why the U.S. view should be adopted. The U.S. has a large interest in the subject because it is currently facing cyber-attacks on its elections.10 Russia previously targeted U.S. elections in 2016, and China's recent behavior indicates that it may plan to do the same in future elections.11 Without an effective set of international laws to govern attacks like these, the U.S. has no legal avenue to deter\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nTo date, no multilateral international conventions on cyber operations have been created, and there is disagreement between western countries and countries like China and Russia as to how the law should be changed.¹² The most significant gathering to date has been the U.N. Governmental Group of Experts (GGE). In 2013 and 2015, this group made groundbreaking progress, including agreeing that international law and the state responsibility principles of sovereignty and non-intervention apply to countries' cyberspace.¹³ However, when it came to taking action on these discussions, the 2016–2017 U.N. GGE meeting was unable to agree on a consensus report on these issues, with some countries (such as the U.S.) objecting to the application of use of force law to cyber-attacks.¹⁴ Notably, the U.S. felt the proposed report inadequately addressed how international humanitarian law, international law governing the right to self-defense, and the law of state responsibility would apply to states' use of “information communication technologies” (ICTs).¹⁵ Mainly, it feared that an unclear position on these issues would HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] lead to destabilization.¹⁶ The main issue has been that, although most of the states involved in these meetings agree on the language of international law, they fundamentally disagree as to what that language means and whether or not it applies to cyber-attacks.¹⁷ ## A. Typology: Cyber-attack, Cyber-warfare, &amp; Cyber-crime Defined.\nThere is currently no accepted consensus on the definition of\"cyber-warfare\"or\"cyber-attack,\"and many groups use a variety of terminology and definitions.¹⁸ As a general matter, however,\"cyber-warfare\"is often defined as\"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\"¹⁹ Cyber-warfare is carried out by means of\"cyber-attacks\".²⁰ Two main definitions of\"cyber-attack\"are important for this paper: (1) the United States government's definition, and (2) the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) definition.²¹ The U.S. government defines a\"cyber-attack\"as:\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nBy confining cyber-attacks to hostile acts specifically intended to disrupt or destroy critical cyber systems, this definition comes off as very narrow and mechanical. In contrast, the SCO broadly defines an “information war” as, in part, a “mass psychologic[al] brainwashing to destabilize society and state, as well as to force the state to take [sic] decisions in the interest of an opposing party.”²³ Furthermore, the SCO considers the HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states” to be one of the main threats to information security.²⁴ Thus, by focusing on attacks on social and political stability, the SCO definition seems to focus more on broad destabilization than just cyber system disruption like the U.S. definition.\nThis confined definition has negative implications on international humanitarian law.²⁵ By suggesting that harm to social, political, and economic systems might justify a government response, the SCO’s definition runs the risk of allowing governments to suppress the political speech of dissenters by arguing that such dissent destabilizes society and the state.²⁶ While the First Amendment protects freedom of expression in the U.S., acceptance of the SCO’s definition in countries without the same protections would create a serious human rights threat to citizens of those countries.²⁷ The U.S. definition of cyber-attack does not leave room for these types of expression restriction justifications because it is mainly focused on the protection of data and computer systems, and less on social and political impact.²⁸ This is the main reason it is imperative that changes to international law be made in favor of the U.S. definition rather than the SCO definition. The SCO’s core membership includes countries with legal and regulatory regimes that tolerate (if not 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 427 authorize or require) pervasive human rights abuses.²⁹ Thus, the SCO’s definition may have even been designed with precisely this type of pre-planned justification in mind.³⁰ In June 2019, for example, China conducted a “denial of service” attack on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service that was being used by Hong Kong protestors, to disrupt their communications and coordination of the recent pro-free speech protests that have erupted in Hong Kong.³¹ Given the current lack of consensus on terminology and applicability of cyber-attacks to international law, the U.S. and SCO have been competing for their respective view to be adopted internationally. In 2011 and 2015, member states of the SCO submitted its International Code of Conduct for Information Security (the “Code”) to the UN General Assembly.³² The SCO claims this Code is intended “to push forward the international debate on international norms on information security, and help HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] forge an early consensus on this issue.”³³ Critics of the Code, however, note that it raises serious human rights concerns because its language prioritizes state sovereignty and territorial dominance in cyberspace above all other concerns.³⁴ This language, along with the above-mentioned trends exhibited by the SCO, including its broad, means-based definition of “information warfare,”³⁵ indicates that its member countries would likely be able to legally violate human rights via the use of cyber-technology were this Code adopted internationally. Therefore, aside from simply protecting its own domestic interests, the U.S. also has an interest in promoting and protecting freedom of expression and association around the world.\nIn addition to the domestic human rights concerns, the SCO’s positions also raise questions about how its member countries view cyber-attacks targeting foreign political elections. Specifically, could they justify election interference under the theory that certain foreign elections equate to the spreading of information that is harmful to “social and political, social and economic systems, as well as spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states?”³⁶ There is some indication they already are.³⁷ Several member states have a history of interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the elections of other countries with which they disagree either socially, politically, or economically.³⁸ For example, in July 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers who were found to have 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 429 carried out large-scale cyber-attacks against the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign just before the 2016 presidential election by targeting election infrastructure and local election officials.³⁹ Similarly, in February 2019, U.S. Cyber Command, a branch of the Department of Defense (DOD), announced that during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections a Russian company involved in information operations against the U.S. during the 2016 presidential election had tried to access election information.⁴⁰ There has been no indication that similar attempts on U.S. electoral systems will dissipate in the near future. In fact, there are indications that China may be the next perpetrator.⁴¹ Specifically, China’s motives look very similar to Russia’s in 2016 and 2018⁴², and China has shown unique signs of a long-term scheme to weaken the United States and become what its leadership has called a “cyber superpower.”⁴³ Thus, the importance of the U.S. leading conversations on changes in HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] international law as it relates to cyber-attacks is not only crucial for the international community in general but may be of use to the U.S. as these threats increase.^[44]^ Lastly,\"cyber-crimes\"are another form of cyber operations.^[45]^ Cyber-crime also has no uniformly accepted definition but has certain characteristics that most countries seem to agree upon.^[46]^ Cyber-crimes are generally recognized as computer-based illegal acts, violating either domestic or international criminal law, but unlike\"cyber-attacks,\"most cyber-crimes involve non-state actors and do not have a political or national security purpose.^[47]^ The most common examples in the U.S. and Europe include online piracy, distribution, and possession of child pornography, and common forms of hacking of personal data such as credit card information.^[48]^ These types of cyber activities occur below the level of a\"use of force,\"and have not been addressed in detail by international laws but rather are left mostly to individual states to legislate.^[49]^ Thus, this paper will focus on cyber-warfare and cyber-attacks, rather than cyber-crimes.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nDrawing the line between what is and is not a punishable offense in the cyber-attack context is made increasingly difficult by the existing law of war framework. Specifically, none of the drafters of these frameworks anticipated their application to cyber-attacks – a futuristic form of attack that has become a reality only in the last two decades.50 In light of this rapidly emerging warfare, many states have been struggling over the answers to the following questions: (1) Can a cyber-attack ever legally amount to an act of war under international law, and (2) what options do states have for responding to such attacks?51 In general, there are two main categories of international law governing warfare between states: *jus ad bellum* and *jus in bello*.52 *Jus ad bellum* refers to the law that governs when states may resort to war or to the use of armed force generally, whereas *jus in bello* refers to the law governing the conduct of parties that are already engaged in an armed conflict.53 This paper will focus only on *jus ad bellum*. This set of laws prohibits “use of force” (including threats of using such force), “armed attacks”, “threats to the peace,” “breach of the peace,” and “acts of aggression.”54 To date, the most important source of *jus ad bellum* is the U.N.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Charter.55 Other aspects of jus ad bellum are derived from customary law and its accompanying international jurisprudence, and thus will be discussed separately.56 They all, however, seem to pose their own problems in the context of cyber-attacks.\n\nArticle 2(4) of the U.N. Charter provides that member states must “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.”57 Although some have argued that Article 2(4) provides a broad prohibition on force, including acts like economic and political coercion,58 the overwhelming majority of commentators today consider “force” in Article 2(4) to be synonymous with “armed force.”59 However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”60 To date, no state has ever formally argued that a cyber-attack is a prohibited “use of force” per Article 2(4).61 However, the increase in cyber-attacks in recent years increases the likelihood that states may at some point begin 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 433 to respond to cyber-attacks with conventional military means if no international framework governing cyber-attacks is agreed upon.⁶² There are only two generally agreed upon exceptions to Article 2(4)’s prohibition of the threat or use of force: (1) actions authorized by the U.N. Security Council under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, and (2) actions that constitute “self-defense” under Article 51.⁶³ Under Chapter VII, the U.N. Security Council can label threats or uses of force as illegal and then may choose the appropriate response measure.⁶⁴ Chapter VII gives the Council three options for courses of action in response to an illegal threat or use of force: (1) Article 39, (2) Article 41, and (3) Article 42.⁶⁵ With regard to Articles 39 and 41, the Council’s decision is expected to be grounded in an intention to restore international peace and security.⁶⁶ Article 39 allows the Council make a non-binding, permissive authorization (military or non-military).⁶⁷ Article 41 provides a list of binding, non-military enforcement measures, including the interruption of railroad, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other communications, as well as the severance of diplomatic relations.⁶⁸ Notable for the cyber-attack context, Article 41 specifically refers to an “interruption of... communication” as a “measure not involving armed force.”⁶⁹ Lastly, Article 42 allows the Council to authorize military action pursuant to a special agreement made between U.N. member states.⁷⁰ As long as the U.N. Security Council has not yet acted under one of these articles, Article 51 allows states to use ⁶². See U.S. DEP’T OF DEFENSE, CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO SECTION 934 OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, at 2 (2011) (declaring that the United States reserves the right to respond to cyber-attacks using “all necessary means – diplomatic, informational, military, and economic”).\n⁶³.

Article 2(4) is only addressed to states and prohibits their threat or use of force in their “international relations” with other states.73 Thus, practically-speaking, states must be able to legally attribute which other state threatened or used force against them. This requires the actions to be “performed by persons or entities acting on behalf or with the authorization or endorsement of a state so as to engage its international legal responsibility for their behaviour.”74 The issues posed by this come to light in two scenarios in the cyber-attack context: (1) when the state-actor hides his/her identity or his/her ties to a state, and (2) when the attacker is a non-state actor.75 As mentioned, attribution can be especially difficult in the cyber-context. Additionally, because the use of force by anyone other than a legally attributable state actor is not covered by the U.N. Charter, a state under attack by a non-state actor would need to look to another area of international law.\nThus, the two main issues with the U.N. Charter as applied to cyber-attacks are (1) its specific language and (2) attribution.\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe other body of law that could be used to fight cyber-attacks is known as\"state responsibility.\"76 Under this set of international laws, a state can be held responsible for an\"internationally wrongful act\"if it (1) is classified as a breach of an international obligation of the state and (2) is attributable to the state under international law.77 As to the first element—a breach of an international obligation of the state—there are a number of international obligations that states are under. There are three main types of international legal obligations that might be breached through a cyber-attack: (a) sovereignty, (b) the duty of non-intervention, and (c) the duty of due diligence.78 First, breaches of sovereignty involve an infringement on a state's territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.79 Similar to the U.N. Charter's\"armed force\"element, this can cause issues in the cyber-attack context.\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] Second, principals of non-intervention are applied through a two-part rule. The ICJ has stated that an act breaches international law under non-intervention principles if: (1) the act is “bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely” and (2) the act uses “methods of coercion.”80 The precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ here, is disputed. Some argue coercion should be defined broadly as including almost any type of state manipulation for self-serving purposes, including economic or political coercion.81 The U.N. General Assembly has taken a similarly broad view of “coercion” in the past, stating that no state possesses “the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in sovereignty of any other State” or use “any... measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights.”82 Others argue coercion should be narrowly defined as physically forcing a state to do something.83 As will be discussed, which view of coercion is applied affects the degree to which the doctrine can be applied to cyber-attacks.\nThird, the ICJ held a state must not “allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other states” and thus has a duty of due diligence in protecting other state from known threats within its territory.84 Applied to the cyber-attack context, the duty of due diligence consists of three main elements: (1) “knowledge” of a cyber operation being carried out from within its territory, (2) a failure to undertake “all reasonably available measures” to end this cyber operation, and (3) the cyber operation is “contrary to the rights” of, and produces “serious adverse consequences for other states.”85 As will be discussed, these requirements also may not fully apply in the cyber-context due to 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 437 the inconspicuous nature of cyber-attacks and the resources it takes to combat large-scale attacks.\nOn their face, neither the U.N. Charter nor the law of state responsibility seems to clearly apply to the cyber-context given the patent differences between the nature of traditional warfare and cyber warfare. These differences, and the required modifications, will be discussed in detail later. First, however, it is necessary that the different types of cyber-attacks be clearly defined, as some of the suggested modifications would only be necessary for certain types of attacks, but not others.\n## C. Types of cyber-attacks.\nAttackers use a variety of strategies when executing a cyber-attack (depending on their goal). Broadly, the two main techniques are cyber-tampering operations and cyber-influencing operations.⁸⁶ Cyber-tampering, or hacking, involves “disrupting, destroying, or altering computer systems or information resident in them.”⁸⁷ On the other hand, cyber-influencing involves “the deployment of resources to alter the behaviour of a targeted audience.”⁸⁸ There are several different types of cyber-influencing operations, including doxing and information operations.⁸⁹ Doxing involves the “exfiltration and leaking of non-public information.”⁹⁰ Information operations involve the “deliberate use of newly-created or publicly available information to threaten, confuse, or mislead a target audience.”⁹¹ Examples of information operations include “trolling” and “fake news.”⁹² Large-scale cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] attack operations often use a combination of these strategies to accomplish their goals.⁹³ Cyber tampering, commonly known as\"hacking,\"is the more familiar form of cyber-attack.⁹⁴ Cyber tampering usually includes tricking people into providing account information and passwords, or downloading malware that infects their computer, such as through phishing e-mails that contain malware-ridden hyperlinks.⁹⁵ Hacking focused on influencing political elections can occur in the form of breaches of voting machines, voter lists, or other systems related to the election process, such as those that contain campaign information.⁹⁶ There is significant evidence that foreign actors have attempted to hack U.S. voting systems in the past.⁹⁷ In July 2018, for example, a U.S. Senator's re-election campaign was unsuccessfully targeted by hackers affiliated with Russia's intelligence agency by sending phishing emails to staffers in her office in attempts to steal passwords and access sensitive information related to the campaign.⁹⁸ On an even larger scale, in February 2018 the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that Russian hackers had successfully hacked into voter registration lists in several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.⁹⁹ Even if election-related citizen information is being legally obtained, such as through an authorized data collection by the government (i.e., law-enforcement systems) or a corporation (i.e., credit card and banking companies), this information can nonetheless be hacked ⁹³.

Cyber-influencing: doxing and information operations.\nCyber-influencing includes “doxing,” and information operations.¹⁰² “Doxing” occurs when a hacker infiltrates a computer system in order to leak non-public information.¹⁰³ In the political context, the purpose of doxing is to influence peoples’ reputations and alter the outcomes of elections as a result.¹⁰⁴ Doxing can take shape in two forms: traditional whistleblowing (exposing wrongdoing to promote the public good), or strategic hacks (leaking of material that is in the interest of the hacker, but not necessarily in the interest of the public).¹⁰⁵ The June 2013 leaks by Edward Snowden, a former systems administrator with the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing documents showing evidence of cyber-espionage conducted by the U.S. against Chinese targets, is an example of traditional\n\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] whistleblowing, with someone from the “inside” exposing information with intentions to benefit the public.¹⁰⁶ The leaking of Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails prior to the 2016 presidential election by Russian hackers is an example of a strategic hack.¹⁰⁷ In the author’s opinion, strategic hacking is the more dangerous of the two types of doxing because the information leaked is more likely to be “tainted,” meaning doctored or wholly fake.¹⁰⁸ Because election interference is almost never done with the public good in mind, it falls squarely under strategic hacking.\nCyber-influencing also includes “trolling” and what is commonly called “fake news,” collectively called “information operations.”¹⁰⁹ Trolling involves attackers causing disruption, or triggering or exacerbating conflict on the internet.¹¹⁰ Trolls often use threats of doxing and intimidation, including threats of death, sexual assault, harm to one’s family, or reputational damage, and often target journalists, political dissenters, and members of ¹⁰⁶. See Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3. Although the platform “Wikileaks” might be confused as a form of traditional whistleblowing, Wikileaks is often used as a platform for strategic hackers to dump leaked material anonymously. See, e.g., id. (discussing when the Department of Homeland Security identified Russia as responsible for the 2016 DNC email hacking and acknowledging that Russia then use Wikileaks to disseminate the emails obtained in the hack); see also Ethan Lozano et al., Wikileaks &amp; Whistleblowing: Digital Information Leakage and Its Impact on Society, STANFORD UNIV., https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/cs181/projects/2010-11/WikiLeaks/online.html (last visited Feb. 5, 2021) (discussing the differences between traditional offline leaks and online leaks through websites like WikiLeaks).\n¹⁰⁷. “Strategic hacking” is not to be confused with cyber-tampering (“hacking”). Strategic hacking is simply the name of a type of cyber-influencing. See Sander, supra note 78, at 9 (classifying “strategic hacking” as a subset of “doxing,” itself a type of cyber-influencing).\n¹⁰⁸.

Specifically, attackers can use them to inflame political and cultural polarization by disseminating extreme viewpoints, while simultaneously downplaying their dangerous effects under a guise of light-hearted joking on the internet.¹¹⁵ Memes can specifically favor one candidate or party over the other, or can simply act as a tool for creating division within a party or country.¹¹⁶ In October 2019, for example, Mark Zuckerberg, the owner of Facebook, announced that the company had recently caught Russian and Iranian backed hackers creating fake accounts, mostly on Instagram, and sharing original meme HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] content.¹¹⁷ Some of the memes were designed to generally create divisiveness between the Democratic party, and some to specifically promote the re-election of Donald Trump.¹¹⁸ Zuckerberg also stated that China had made attempts to influence operations via Facebook, but that Facebook's security team had been able to step in before much was seen by users.¹¹⁹ In contrast, the Russian and Iranian efforts reached large audiences before being detected.¹²⁰ Cyber-influencing also includes the spread of misinformation, more commonly known as\"fake news.\"¹²¹ Although election experts have long worried about the electoral effects of the uninformed voter, cyber influencing tactics like fake news has increased the number of potentially misinformed voters.¹²² This category, much like trolling, often uses fake social media accounts, memes, and other organic forms of disinformation spread by users.¹²³ The type of medium used is very important to the effectiveness of fake news. Specifically, the amount of influence a piece of misinformation has can also be artificially expanded through the use of algorithms, automation, and\"targeting.\"¹²⁴ These strategies allow the attacker to hone in their message to certain groups of people and to spread the information in strategic ways.¹²⁵\"Bots,\"for example, can be used to suppress 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 443 already popular content that they do not want to spread, or to amplify content that attackers want to make seem more popular (which to make things even more difficult to track, can make things actually more popular).¹²⁶ Similarly, “sock puppets,” which are fake accounts run by humans that enable attackers to spread information behind a hidden or misrepresented identity, can be used to make certain information seem more authentic by impersonating trusted sources.¹²⁷ Because of the intangible, untraceable, and overall immeasurable nature of cyber-attacks, the use of these cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing tactics by foreign actors is not punishable under the laws as written. Therefore, I suggest that certain modifications be made to the language of these international laws in order to make them more applicable to cyber-attacks, specially to the tactics used to influence elections.\n## II. ANALYSIS A. Amendments that need to be made to the pre-existing legal frameworks in order to be applicable to cyber-attacks.\nDue to the lack of foresight regarding cyber-attacks at the time the pre-existing international law was drafted, it is no surprise that none of them fully encompass the attributes of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare. However, there are a few changes that can be made to these laws that would make them more applicable to cyber-attacks.\n\nResolution and Hyper-Personalization, TOW CTR.

Charter provides a very broad definition of\"use of force.\"¹²⁸ However, the international community consensus seems to be that this simply means\"armed force.\"¹²⁹ The ICJ has defined\"armed attack\"as\"the most grave forms of the use of force.\"¹³⁰ This language seems clearly geared towards physical consequences. In light of this, there is an argument to be made that cyber-attacks amounting to physical destruction, death, and injury would fall under Article 2(4). For example, hacking into nuclear plant systems to cause a meltdown, hacking into a dam's controls and flooding a nearby populated area, or hacking into an airport's air traffic control system and disabling communications would all certainly result in physical consequences and could be punishable under Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.\nThis covers many forms of cyber-tampering, but what about the cyber-tampering that doesn't create physical destruction? Finding a way to fit these types of cyber-attacks under Article 2(4) is much more challenging. The ICJ later stated that the prohibition on the use of\"force\"applies to\"any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.\"¹³¹ This indicates that Article 2(4) could apply to even those cases of cyber-attacks without physical consequences. But Article 41 weakens this argument, as it specifically refers to\"interruption of... communication\"as\"measures not involving the use of armed force.\"¹³² The context of Article 41, however, illustrates that this statement refers to state responses to an\"armed attack,\"¹³³ and not to the original attack itself. Thus, perhaps the aggressive 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 445 intent of a cyber-attack would be enough to classify it as an “armed attack” under Article 2(4), arguing that cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing are technological “weapons.”\nBut is there any indication that the international community sees it this way? Contrary to the widely accepted view that a state can use force in self-defense only in response to an “armed attack” – the gravest form of force – the U.S. has historically maintained that force can be used in self-defense in response to any amount of force used against it.¹³⁴ This comports with the ICJ’s broad assertion that the prohibition on the use of “force” applies to “any use of force, regardless of the weapons employed.”¹³⁵ Thus, the easiest way to make Article 2(4) more applicable to all cyber-tampering is to formally broaden the definitions of “use of force” and “armed attack.” One way to do this would be to include a specific provision that ties in the United States’ definition of cyber-attack. For example, “use of force” and “armed attack” could both be defined to include “[a] hostile act using computer or related networks or systems, and intended to disrupt and/or destroy an adversary’s critical cyber systems, assets, or functions.”¹³⁶ With this modification, “force” and “armed” could be extended to apply not just to traditional weaponry, but also cyber-weaponry like that used for cyber-tampering.\nHowever, even these broader definitions probably fail to cover cyber-influencing because cyber-influencing is usually much more subtle and leaves much less tangible evidence behind.¹³⁷ Due to the difficulties of reconciling a “use of force” or “armed attack” with things like trolling, doxing, and spreading fake news, cyber-influencing would likely best be addressed in a separate body of law. Adding it to Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter most likely would risk over broadening the article and rendering it obsolete as a result. Instead, cyber-influencing could be addressed as an ¹³⁴.

However, each principle would also need slight modification in order to apply.\nBut even if Article 2(4) could be modified to include all cyber-tampering, the second incompatibility between cyber-attacks and the U.N. Charter is the issue of attribution. This issue is present in both the cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing contexts. With cyber-attacks, attribution can be difficult because it is almost always conducted remotely or behind technological disguises such as proxies and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which effectively scramble your location if anyone attempts to track the network connection.[138] Attackers also often utilize multiple computer systems in different states[139] or use anti-attribution technology that hides their identity or location.[140] Many cyber-attackers are also sophisticated non-state actors, either acting independently or as a cyber proxy for a state.[141] Additionally, because the person actually conducting the cyber-operations may not be clearly linked to the state, this can make it very difficult for victim states to provide a legal nexus between the breach of international law and said state, which is required for any action to be taken.[142] However, even if a specific state could be identified as being responsible for the cyber-attack, public acknowledgement of this attribution may not be desirable for the victim state for national security, public morale, and diplomacy purposes.[143] These attribution issues, inherent in the cyber-world, 2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 447 may simply be unavoidable. In addition to being an obstacle to applicability under the U.N. Charter, this issue of attribution also comes up under the laws of state responsibility. These laws, discussed next, allow the U.N. to hold accountable states which are found to have committed internationally wrongful acts.\n\ni. Sovereignty should be modified to encompass digital territory as well as physical.\nBreaches of sovereignty involve infringement of a state’s territorial integrity, which is generally interpreted as physical territorial integrity.¹⁴⁴ This requirement poses a few issues in the cyber-context. First, cyber-attacks often cannot be said to result in “physical damage or injury” to a state.¹⁴⁵ However, unlike the U.N. Charter, it could be argued that breaches of sovereignty may actually reach farther than just “physical damage or injury.” In the early stages of the digital age, experts almost unanimously asserted that attacks on cyber-space could not result in breaches of sovereignty because sovereignty rights protected strictly physical parameters.¹⁴⁶ However, most countries have, in practice, considered cyber-space to be legally tied to their “territory.”¹⁴⁷ For example, states exercise this territorial sovereignty over cyberspace when they pass domestic cyber-crime laws.¹⁴⁸ One way to reconcile these views is the fact that cyber- HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] space actually requires physical components within a state's territory to function, such as fiber-optic cables, copper wires, microwave relay towers, satellite transponders, and internet routers.¹⁴⁹ Thus, to address the physical territory element, the simplest fix would be to codify this practice into the text of the Articles on State Responsibility. For clarity, the updated articles should state that\"territory\"includes not only physical boundaries and possessions (which would cover cyber-tampering), but also violations of infrastructure sovereignty through technological means (to cover cyber-influencing). Specifically, it should state that sovereignty can be violated by an attempt to influence political and economic outcomes through the hostile use of computer or network systems. This should address the physical boundary obstacle in the current language. To address the physical damage element, the Articles would also need to broadly define damage or injury to the state. Damage should be defined as including compromised data (to cover cyber-tampering) and as damage or injury to the sovereign integrity of the state (to cover cyber-influencing). Although this can seem intangible, one way to measure damage from cyber-influencing is to measure the extent of audience reach. This makes sense because the state's injury grows with each person that is affected by doxing, that experiences trolling, or views fake news. This would cover both cyber-tampering efforts and cyber-influencing efforts by states without making the principle overly broad. However, extending the principle of sovereignty to attacks on the sovereign integrity of a state may necessarily overlap with non-intervention. Thus, changes to both may not be necessary to achieve a set of laws applicable to both cyber-tampering and cyber-influencing, but it's espionage being committed against Brazil in the Edward Snowden leaks, and quoting her explicit condemnation of such actions as a breach of sovereignty). However, it should be noted that other countries that spoke out against these NSA leaks did not explicitly invoke sovereignty as a ground and thus it should not be assumed that cyber-attacks are universally considered breaches of territorial sovereignty.

Duties of non-intervention should be modified to include a broad definition of “coercion.”\nAlthough they overlap in many respects, the principal of non-intervention is somewhat easier to apply to cyber-attacks than the principles of sovereignty. On its face, non-intervention is a better fit for cyber-attacks because it lacks the physical territory element that breach of sovereignty requires. However, a few changes to non-intervention could still make it apply more cleanly.\nThe first requirement – an act bearing on matters that each state is free to decide – seems relatively easy to meet for most types of cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁰ Scholars have extended this category to generally include state organization as something that a state may freely decide.¹⁵¹ Thus, a state’s electoral, political, and economic systems, for example, are each something that it freely chooses.¹⁵² Since electoral and economic systems are large pieces of a state’s freely chosen organization, a cyber-attack on a state’s elections or economy would likely meet the first requirement.¹⁵³ However, the second requirement – coercion – poses several issues. For one, the precise scope of “coercion,” as used by the ICJ HOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] here, is disputed.¹⁵⁴ Most states have defined this element as physically forcing a state to do something.¹⁵⁵ Some, however, have urged that coercion actually is meant to be read as also including political or economic “influence” on the state’s behavior.¹⁵⁶ While the strict “force” definition can be applied to cyber-tampering in the sense that one state is forcing the other to turn over data by simply stealing it, the broader “influence” definition would be the most viable avenue for the law to apply to cyber-influencing. This is because there are a variety of motivations that states may have for interfering in elections or economies, and each would fall under this broader umbrella of seeking to “influence” another state’s political or economic affairs.¹⁵⁷ Thus, “coercion” would need to be defined in the Articles on State Responsibility as including the “force” definition as the general definition, as well as a broader “influence” definition that specifically applies to cyber-influencing. However, this definition needs to be narrowly tailored to interferences in a state’s elections or economy, because otherwise it risks looking like the SCO’s definition of cyber-attack and putting citizens at risk.\niii. The duty of due diligence is likely unworkable because it may be difficult to locate the source of a cyber-attack and the consequences can be hard to measure.\n¹⁵⁴. TALLINN MANUAL 2.0, supra note 79, at 317 (stating that international law does not have a strict definition of coercion).\n¹⁵⁵. Sander, supra note 78, at 24 (discussing the difficulties of concluding cyber influence on elections as a prohibited form of intervention because traditionally, international law results from examples of physical actions).\n¹⁵⁶. See, e.g., Bowett, supra note 81, at 248–49 (explaining that coercive actions are broad in that they usually entail economic influence or impact and that the line between economic and political motives is unclear, so if political influence is allowed through coercion, then regulation of economic coercion is unlikely).\n¹⁵⁷. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 45, 47 (defining prohibited forms of intervention as including “the manipulation by cyber means of elections or of public opinion on the eve of elections, as when online news services are altered in favour of a particular party, false news is spread, or the online services of one party are shut off”); see also Buchan, supra note 148, at 78, 80 (stating that “conduct which compromises or undermines the authority of the state should be regarded as coercive,” including when State data is simply “accessed and appropriated” by a cyber-attacker).\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS 451 As written, the due diligence duty is also not cleanly applicable to cyber-attacks.¹⁵⁸ The principle of due diligence is the weakest of the three state responsibility principles and would require the most modification. The first element – knowledge – requires actual knowledge and seems to depend on the scenario.¹⁵⁹ If a state is responsible for an attack, it will necessarily have knowledge of the cyber operation. If a state is not responsible for an attack, it likely will not have knowledge of the operation and domestic cyber-crime laws may be more applicable in the first place. Alternatively, a state may be knowingly harboring a cyber-attacker in order to scramble responsibility. In this case, the knowledge element clearly matters. But even if a state knows a cyber-attacker is commencing attacks within its borders, it is still often unclear who is behind it.¹⁶⁰ As discussed above with attribution issues under the U.N. Charter, cyber-attackers often work remotely or disguise their identities and locations.¹⁶¹ In this sense, this duty may needlessly impose multiple layers of liability upon states.¹⁶² If a cyber-attack is threaded through servers or other technology located in multiple countries, multiple parties could be accused of failing to take reasonable measures to end an attack. But as noted, this may simply be an unavoidable consequence of the nature of cyber operations.\n¹⁵⁸. See TALLINN MANUAL 1.0, supra note 49, at 206 (noting that, like sovereignty, the duty of due diligence is also contested among international communities as to whether it is an international legal obligation in the cyber-attack context).\n¹⁵⁹. See id. (clarifying that there is no consensus on whether this standard applies with only constructive knowledge).\n¹⁶⁰. Chircop, supra note 141, at 666–67 (stating that the uncertainty and anonymity of the cyber-sphere hinders the emergency of a clear State practice regarding the application of due diligence to cyber-attacks).\n¹⁶¹. See Waxman, supra note 30, at 447 (discussing how cyber-conflict is likely to exacerbate the already-existing challenges posed by proxy wars because actors can more easily “mask or anonymize their identity and because the ‘movements’ and ‘terrain’ of cyber-warfare can be dispersed across global information networks and will often be carried out on private infrastructure”).\n¹⁶². See id. at 448 (“[C]yber-warfare may lack clearly discernible starting points and readily observable or provable actions and counter-actions.”); Chircop, supra note 141, at 650 (“[A] natural concern with accepting a due diligence standard of attribution is that it would lead to indeterminate liability for states.”).\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] The second element – failure to take reasonably feasible measures to end the attack¹⁶³ – can pose issues in the cyber-attack context because, in the case of a complex and well-executed cyber-attack, it can be unclear what “reasonably feasible measures to end the attack” means. As a result, if due diligence were to be applied, a state may be held responsible for a cyber-attack when it can be traced to its territory, but it may not have the means or even know how or where to stop the attack.¹⁶⁴ This too can needlessly impose liability on a victim state, when the real target is the person executing the cyber-attack.\nThe third obstacle is the principle’s requirement that the act be contrary to the state’s rights.¹⁶⁵ Similar to the attribution obstacle, this requirement is easier to meet in the cyber-tampering context. It’s much easier to show that a data breach is a violation of a state’s national secrets and more on par with espionage. With cyber-influencing, however, the line is much less clear. The best argument is that a state’s political and economic sovereignty is a state right and that any degree of interference with either of these amounts to an act contrary to the state’s rights. But, recall that this would be entirely dependent upon whether or not sovereignty is redefined to broadly include digital territory and damage to political and economic integrity.\nThe next element – “serious adverse consequences”¹⁶⁶ – is also not particularly helpful when dealing with cyber-attacks. This is because the seriousness of cyber-influencing can be extremely hard to measure without some sort of tangible injury.¹⁶⁷ As stated, physical injury is not likely if the attacker is only utilizing cyber-influencing operations. Thus, as above, cyber-tampering is much easier to reconcile with this definition because, for example, it can result in national security threats if military data is breached (think, as an extreme example, if nuclear access codes are hacked or if power grids are shut down nationwide), and it can result in massive privacy breaches, both in terms of individual citizens and\n\n2021] INTERNATIONAL INADEQUACY FOR CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nOverall, neither the pre-existing U.N. framework nor the duties under the customary international law principle of state responsibility are well suited as written for all cyber-attacks. Both would need to be tailored in at least a few areas in order to be workable, and even then, the duty of due diligence would likely be incompatible with cyber-attacks.\n## III. CONCLUSION The current state of international law is insufficient to address cyber-attacks, leaving countries vulnerable to cyber-attacks without recourse, and leaving countries with powerful cyber-capabilities free to attack with essentially no direct threat of international legal punishment. The seemingly never-ending counterattacks that countries like the U.S., China, and Russia have been carrying out against each other over the past few years demonstrate the result of a missing applicable legal framework. As the law currently stands, there are several gaps that must be filled in order for it to be applicable to cyber-attacks, and ¹⁶⁸. See Sander, supra note 78, at 38 (mentioning breaches of privacy as a potential result of cyber doxing operations). As a side note, interference with power grids is not as unlikely as it may sound. In December 2012, two U.S. power plants were compromised through something as simple as unprotected and infected USB drives, and in May 2013, the Department of Homeland Security reported that U.S. electrical grids were being constantly probed by multiple state actors, including Iran. Significant Cyber Incidents, supra note 3.\nHOUSTON JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW [Vol. 43:3] essentially all U.N. member states recognize this. How exactly to fill those gaps though, is greatly contested. The U.S. must directly compete with SCO-member countries like China and Russia to have its definitions and interpretations of the U.N. Charter and international principles of state responsibility put into effect. The U.S. pushing for definitions and interpretations that both maintain the statute of the current international laws, but do not degrade human rights, is imperative not only for its own domestic interests, but also to ensure that rights to free expression and association are protected around the world.\nThis paper has suggested several modifications. First, an additional cyber-specific definition of\"armed attack\"based on the U.S. definition of cyber-attack is needed to make the U.N. Charter workable. Second, codifying the inclusion of cyber-space in the definition of\"territory\"is necessary to make the principle of sovereignty applicable. Third, broadening the term\"coercion\"to include political and economic coercion conducted by through cyber means, again based on the U.S. definition, is necessary to make non-intervention workable. If the U.S. is unable to cultivate agreement among other U.N. member states on these or similar changes, electoral interference in future elections will be entirely undeterrable and unpunishable under international law, and the United States' only option will be to counteract cyber-attacks with its own cyber-attacks. This, however, would do nothing to limit the effects that cyber-insecurity during another U.S. election would have on the American electoral system, and the trust that American citizens hold in the validity of the electoral results. Thus, because cyber-warfare has seemingly outpaced international law, it is time for the law to catch up."
