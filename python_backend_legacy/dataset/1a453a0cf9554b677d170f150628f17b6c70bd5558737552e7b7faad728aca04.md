Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser**\n## Introduction\nThe 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law\nAirspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet¹ or remain very general.²\n---\n* LL.M.

During the 1970s personal computers became affordable for everyone in the Western world and were perceived as a step towards democratization of information technologies. The subsequent networking of personal computers via the emerging internet was understood as a technical means to boost the freedom of speech, similar to Gutenberg’s printing press in the 15th century. Today we know that electronic information networks can work in two ways, not only as a support of the freedom of speech, but also as a means to exploit, manipulate and control information. Cyber activities consist of access to computer systems for retrieving or introducing packages of data and/or computer software programs (to execute a specific task when activated).⁴ Unauthorized⁵ cyber activities may be used to destroy not only the software and hardware of the prey computer, but also misuse the seized computers to produce further damage to third parties, including physical damage to individuals or property.⁶ Cyber security is to protect the integrity of electronic data and to prevent its unauthorized use. It encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. National rules, for example on privacy of information, cannot cope with the international characteristics of cyber space. Information in networks is processed and stored by data transfers worldwide. The territorial scope of national rules is too narrow, as it can unfold its legal effect only in those portions of the cyber infrastructure located within the given State.\nThe purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But\n³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nthis is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n7 The term cyber-attack is used here in a purely technical sense in a peace time scenario and not in the meaning of armed conflict.\n8 Segregated or ‘air gapped’ networks means to secure computer networks by isolating them “… both physically and electromagnetically”, see *Mudrinich*, Cyber 3.0: The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the Attribution Problem, in: The Air Force Law Review, vol. 68, 198 (2012).\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n399\nes. For example, cyber interference with the payload control of a satellite or space probe may have no safety impact, but affect the on-board applications⁹ and render its purpose useless.\nThe identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹²\n## B. Air Law¹³\nIn aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security:\n- non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems,\n- safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and\n- flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\n9 For example communication, navigation, remote sensing, scientific research.\n10 Traditionally, States are not considered responsible for the acts of persons or a group of persons not acting on behalf of the State. This is reflected in the International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83 (2001), Annex, Article 11.\n11 Healey, Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks, in: Atlantic Council, Issue Brief, (2012).\n12 Activities' in 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China's Cyber Activities, at 149-151, http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/2012-Report-to-Congress.pdf. \"While it's very difficult in cyber to have a 'smoking gun', so to speak, the clear paths back into servers and other mechanical devices inside of the Chinese sovereign domain remain a constant problem for us [the U.S. defense establishment].\" Vice Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright, id. at 153.\n13 For more details see Kaiser / Aretz, Legal Protection of Civil and Military Aviation against Cyber Interference, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n14 Airline data bases hold large amounts of sensitive personal information which are exchanged internationally, see also Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Council of the European Union, 2011/0382 (NLE).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nThe second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice:\n“Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵\nThis recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety\nAny future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.\nCyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.\n## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure\nAir Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network\n¹⁵ Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.\n¹⁶ To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n401\n(AFTN) is the communications backbone of ATM for which interoperability is of essence.¹⁷ Technically the most secure solution for the security of such kind of a network would be full physical separation from other network hardware including the internet. This does not appear to be feasible, which leaves only the standard technical means of protection like encryption and fire-walls. Nevertheless, technical measures for critical aviation infrastructure like CNS-ATM need to be flanked by regulation to ensure cyber security in a dynamic and pro-active manner that reaches beyond existing safety regulations.¹⁸\nThe vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation.¹⁹ It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure²⁰ in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure²¹ which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.²²\n## III. Critical Aircraft Systems\nCyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi-\n¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified:\n- Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and\n- they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous\n²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n403\nnon-safety functions available in aircraft like Aeronautical Passenger Communication (APC) and on-board entertainment systems.\nUnauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵\n## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law\nDifferent to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n# C. Space Law³¹\nIn space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference:\n- the terrestrial segment\n- the space segment and\n- peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities.³² Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities.³³ The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments³⁴.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted³⁵. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and\n³¹ For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n³² In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n³³ In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

See 6.2.4.2.

Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of\n⁴⁰ Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

VI of the Outer Space Treaty, supra note 41: ‘States Party to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space [...] whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions of set for in the present Treaty.

Two scenarios need to be distinguished: unauthorized cyber activities against the flight control or the payload control of a space object.\n## II. Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n1. States should agree on the primary responsibility to refrain from tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging⁵¹ in whatever\n⁴⁹ The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n⁵⁰ For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n⁵¹ In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...].

The authorization and supervision of States under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty need to be expanded to cover cyber security of flight control. National legislation and enforcement need to set the legal parameters of States' 'continued supervision', possibly by reference to international technical recommendations, to protect space systems against unauthorized cyber activities, like ITU recommendations53 or standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)54 and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n3. A neutral body may help to share information on cyber threats to space systems, to collect evidence that may serve as proof of unauthorized cyber acts and also to help and support victim States in efforts to neutralize such dangers.\n4. Regardless of the responsibility and liability of the launching State, also such States should be responsible and (absolutely) liable for national cyber activities that lead a space segment of another State to cause damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. This responsibility and liability should apply for activities by governmental or non-governmental entities and encompass compensation for damages to the launching State and to third-party States that suffer damage in their territory or to their aircraft in flight.\nsponsible\". United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Judgement (United States of America v. Iran) I.C.J. Rep. 1980, para. 74.\n52 Of course, a State that tolerates, encourages, coordinates and/or engages in damaging cyber activities would deny attribution. Nevertheless, it is possible to make a strong case against such State with compelling evidence, see U.S. Department of Defense for the First Time Attributes Cyber Espionage to China, in: 2013 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 245, http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Annual_Report/Chapters/Chapter %202%3B%20Section%202%20China%27s%20Cyber%20Activities.pdf. \"When confronted with public accusations from the United States about its cyber espionage, Beijing attempted to refute the evidence, in part, by pointing to the anonymity of cyberspace and the lack of verifiable technical forensic data.

States who fail to comply with their supervisory obligations or by actively tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging in cyber activities should be deemed responsible in the sense of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and be considered at fault for liability regarding loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or damage to property on board of a seized space objects and also to further damage in outer space to a third State.\n6. Evolving technical standards adopted and implemented by Launching States as part of their ‘continued supervision’⁵⁵ can serve as an indicator of a launching State’s due care in the context of fault-based liability under Article III of the Liability Convention.\n7. Launching States who have become the target of unauthorized cyber activities that affect the flight control of their space objects need to undertake all reasonable actions to prevent or halt such interference with its national space objects by using their own technical means or by requesting the assistance of other States to avert impending dangers.\n8. State need to inform the international community of cyber security threats that can affect space objects and may consequently lead to loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or property damage.\n## III. Payload Control\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention⁵⁶: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n⁵⁵ See paragraph 2) above.\n⁵⁶ Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n## D. Conclusion\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law\nAirspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet or remain very general.\n---\n* LL.M.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But\n There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nthis is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States. Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments. Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.\n## B. Air Law\nIn aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security:\n- non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems and airport luggage transport systems,\n- safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and\n- flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nThe second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice:\n“Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”\nThis recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls. More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety\nAny future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.\nCyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.\n## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure\nAir Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network\n Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.\n To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation. It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.\n## III. Critical Aircraft Systems\nCyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi-\n See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security. Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions. For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified:\n- Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and\n- they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous\n For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nUnauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.\n## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law\nDifferent to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929 and the Montreal Convention of 1999 have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952 and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971 is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage. However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n# C. Space Law\nIn space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference:\n- the terrestrial segment\n- the space segment and\n- peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities. Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities. The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and\n For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Liability Convention of 1973 establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility and liability for outer space activities.

This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly, during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of\n Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\n## II. Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n1. States should agree on the primary responsibility to refrain from tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging in whatever\n The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...]. The militants, authors of the invasion and jailers of the hostages, had now become agents of the Iranian State for whose acts the State itself was internationally re-\nZLW 64.

The authorization and supervision of States under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty need to be expanded to cover cyber security of flight control. National legislation and enforcement need to set the legal parameters of States' 'continued supervision', possibly by reference to international technical recommendations, to protect space systems against unauthorized cyber activities, like ITU recommendations53 or standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)54 and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n3. A neutral body may help to share information on cyber threats to space systems, to collect evidence that may serve as proof of unauthorized cyber acts and also to help and support victim States in efforts to neutralize such dangers.\n4. Regardless of the responsibility and liability of the launching State, also such States should be responsible and (absolutely) liable for national cyber activities that lead a space segment of another State to cause damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. This responsibility and liability should apply for activities by governmental or non-governmental entities and encompass compensation for damages to the launching State and to third-party States that suffer damage in their territory or to their aircraft in flight.\nsponsible\".

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\n6. Evolving technical standards adopted and implemented by Launching States as part of their ‘continued supervision’ can serve as an indicator of a launching State’s due care in the context of fault-based liability under Article III of the Liability Convention.\n7. Launching States who have become the target of unauthorized cyber activities that affect the flight control of their space objects need to undertake all reasonable actions to prevent or halt such interference with its national space objects by using their own technical means or by requesting the assistance of other States to avert impending dangers.\n8. State need to inform the international community of cyber security threats that can affect space objects and may consequently lead to loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or property damage.\n## III. Payload Control\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n See paragraph 2) above.\n Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n## D. Conclusion\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser** ## Introduction The 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law Airspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet¹ or remain very general.² --- * LL.M.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law The purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But ³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles this is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law The identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹² ## B. Air Law¹³ In aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security: - non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems, - safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and - flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles The second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice: “Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵ This recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.",
    "I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety Any future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.": "Cyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.",
    "II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure Air Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network ¹⁵ Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.": "¹⁶ To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law The vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation.¹⁹ It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure²⁰ in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure²¹ which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.²² ## III. Critical Aircraft Systems Cyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi- ¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified: - Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and - they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous ²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law Unauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵ ## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law Different to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation, not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles # C. Space Law³¹ In space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference: - the terrestrial segment - the space segment and - peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities.³² Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities.³³ The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments³⁴.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted³⁵. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and ³¹ For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n³² In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n³³ In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law Unauthorized cyber activities may have various effects on space systems, depending if they are intended: - to access or retrieve information produced by the payload of a space object (e.g. data generated by a remote sensing or communication satellite without authorisation); - to disrupt the transmission of information (by degrading or altering the data or blocking the transmission or reception, e.g. of communication, navigation or remote sensing signals); - to damage or destroy a space object’s on board computer systems, software or hardware (e.g. through malware); - to seize a space object by manipulating its flight control, possibly resulting in damage to the space object itself and also to third parties (e.g. depletion of limited satellite resources, changing the attitude control³⁶ or trajectory of the space object to cause profit loss, collisions with another space object, launch accidents or atmospheric re-entry and damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight)³⁷.\n## I. State Responsibility and Liability for Space Activities Due to the high risks to the Earth’s environment, and persons and property on the Earth and the catastrophic damage³⁸ that may unfold on the surface of the Earth with only short warning time,³⁹ space activities are considered as Jet Propulsion Laboratory also suffered an attack that compromised its computer network; see 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China’s Cyber Activities, 155.\n³⁶ A satellite’s ‘attitude control’ is necessary to maintain sensors and other instruments aligned in a specific position, in order to perform certain tasks as maintaining communication with Earth stations. See 6.2.4.2. Attitude Control, ITU, Handbook on Satellite Communications, (2002), 369-370.\n³⁷ In such scenarios, the perpetrator needs to possess specific knowledge on confidential information of a satellite’s hardware, command structure, signal frequency, modulation, data rate, etc. Huber, DLR, personal communication with the author, 9 October 2013. In the present trend of confidential information theft, there is a growing probability of acquiring information to manipulate the flight control of space objects for unauthorized seizure.\n³⁸ ‘Damage’ is defined in Liability Convention Art. 1 (a) as ‘[...]loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organizations [...]’.\n³⁹ ‘[...] any damage is likely to occur swiftly and may often be catastrophic.’ Lyall / Larsen, Space Law, A Treatise (2009), 66.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ‘ultra-hazardous’ activities.⁴⁰ The Outer Space Treaty of 1967⁴¹ and the Liability Convention of 1973⁴² establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility⁴³ and liability⁴⁴ for outer space activities. Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of ⁴⁰ Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

VI of the Outer Space Treaty, supra note 41: ‘States Party to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space [...] whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions of set for in the present Treaty. The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space [...] shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty [...]’.\n⁴⁶ ‘Launching State’ is defined in Art. 1 (c) of the Liability Convention as ‘(i) A State which launches or procures the launching of a space object; (ii) A State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched’.\n⁴⁷ Art. 2 of the Liability Convention: ‘A launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damages caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.’ ⁴⁸ Hobe, Art I, Outer Space Treaty, in: Cologne Commentary on Space Law, supra note 3, p. 34.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n## II. Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n⁴⁹ The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n⁵⁰ For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n⁵¹ In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...].

    "III. Payload Control": "Unauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention⁵⁶: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n⁵⁵ See paragraph 2) above.\n⁵⁶ Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64.

    "Conclusion": "Aviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser**\n## Introduction\nThe 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law\nAirspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet or remain very general.\n---\n* LL.M.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But\n There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nthis is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States. Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments. Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.\n## B. Air Law\nIn aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security:\n- non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems and airport luggage transport systems,\n- safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and\n- flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nThe second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice:\n“Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”\nThis recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls. More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety\nAny future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.\nCyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.\n## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure\nAir Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network\n Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.\n To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation. It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.\n## III. Critical Aircraft Systems\nCyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi-\n See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security. Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions. For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified:\n- Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and\n- they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous\n For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nUnauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.\n## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law\nDifferent to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929 and the Montreal Convention of 1999 have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952 and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971 is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage. However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n# C. Space Law\nIn space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference:\n- the terrestrial segment\n- the space segment and\n- peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities. Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities. The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and\n For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nUnauthorized cyber activities may have various effects on space systems, depending if they are intended:\n- to access or retrieve information produced by the payload of a space object (e.g. data generated by a remote sensing or communication satellite without authorisation);\n- to disrupt the transmission of information (by degrading or altering the data or blocking the transmission or reception, e.g. of communication, navigation or remote sensing signals);\n- to damage or destroy a space object’s on board computer systems, software or hardware (e.g. through malware);\n- to seize a space object by manipulating its flight control, possibly resulting in damage to the space object itself and also to third parties (e.g. depletion of limited satellite resources, changing the attitude control or trajectory of the space object to cause profit loss, collisions with another space object, launch accidents or atmospheric re-entry and damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight).\n## I. State Responsibility and Liability for Space Activities\nDue to the high risks to the Earth’s environment, and persons and property on the Earth and the catastrophic damage that may unfold on the surface of the Earth with only short warning time, space activities are considered as\nJet Propulsion Laboratory also suffered an attack that compromised its computer network; see 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China’s Cyber Activities, 155.\n A satellite’s ‘attitude control’ is necessary to maintain sensors and other instruments aligned in a specific position, in order to perform certain tasks as maintaining communication with Earth stations. See 6.2.4.2. Attitude Control, ITU, Handbook on Satellite Communications, (2002), 369-370.\n In such scenarios, the perpetrator needs to possess specific knowledge on confidential information of a satellite’s hardware, command structure, signal frequency, modulation, data rate, etc. Huber, DLR, personal communication with the author, 9 October 2013. In the present trend of confidential information theft, there is a growing probability of acquiring information to manipulate the flight control of space objects for unauthorized seizure.\n ‘Damage’ is defined in Liability Convention Art. 1 (a) as ‘[...]loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organizations [...]’.\n ‘[...] any damage is likely to occur swiftly and may often be catastrophic.’ Lyall / Larsen, Space Law, A Treatise (2009), 66.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n‘ultra-hazardous’ activities. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Liability Convention of 1973 establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility and liability for outer space activities. Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly, during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of\n Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n1. States should agree on the primary responsibility to refrain from tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging in whatever\n The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...].

The authorization and supervision of States under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty need to be expanded to cover cyber security of flight control. National legislation and enforcement need to set the legal parameters of States' 'continued supervision', possibly by reference to international technical recommendations, to protect space systems against unauthorized cyber activities, like ITU recommendations53 or standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)54 and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n3. A neutral body may help to share information on cyber threats to space systems, to collect evidence that may serve as proof of unauthorized cyber acts and also to help and support victim States in efforts to neutralize such dangers.\n4. Regardless of the responsibility and liability of the launching State, also such States should be responsible and (absolutely) liable for national cyber activities that lead a space segment of another State to cause damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. This responsibility and liability should apply for activities by governmental or non-governmental entities and encompass compensation for damages to the launching State and to third-party States that suffer damage in their territory or to their aircraft in flight.\nsponsible\".

Evolving technical standards adopted and implemented by Launching States as part of their ‘continued supervision’ can serve as an indicator of a launching State’s due care in the context of fault-based liability under Article III of the Liability Convention.\n7. Launching States who have become the target of unauthorized cyber activities that affect the flight control of their space objects need to undertake all reasonable actions to prevent or halt such interference with its national space objects by using their own technical means or by requesting the assistance of other States to avert impending dangers.\n8. State need to inform the international community of cyber security threats that can affect space objects and may consequently lead to loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or property damage.\n## III. Payload Control\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n See paragraph 2) above.\n Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n## D. Conclusion\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 397 Our everyday environment becomes increasingly dependent on information technologies and thus on cyber space.³ Initially computers were expensive and monstrous, so that only a limited number of ‘mainframes’ existed for specialized scientific, industrial, military and state purposes. During the 1970s personal computers became affordable for everyone in the Western world and were perceived as a step towards democratization of information technologies. The subsequent networking of personal computers via the emerging internet was understood as a technical means to boost the freedom of speech, similar to Gutenberg’s printing press in the 15th century. Today we know that electronic information networks can work in two ways, not only as a support of the freedom of speech, but also as a means to exploit, manipulate and control information. Cyber activities consist of access to computer systems for retrieving or introducing packages of data and/or computer software programs (to execute a specific task when activated).⁴ Unauthorized⁵ cyber activities may be used to destroy not only the software and hardware of the prey computer, but also misuse the seized computers to produce further damage to third parties, including physical damage to individuals or property.⁶ Cyber security is to protect the integrity of electronic data and to prevent its unauthorized use. It encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. National rules, for example on privacy of information, cannot cope with the international characteristics of cyber space. Information in networks is processed and stored by data transfers worldwide. The territorial scope of national rules is too narrow, as it can unfold its legal effect only in those portions of the cyber infrastructure located within the given State. The purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But ³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf. ⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350. ⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system. ⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles this is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. The protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain. Different to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft. Unauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface. In aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 7 The term cyber-attack is used here in a purely technical sense in a peace time scenario and not in the meaning of armed conflict. 8 Segregated or ‘air gapped’ networks means to secure computer networks by isolating them “… both physically and electromagnetically”, see *Mudrinich*, Cyber 3.0: The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the Attribution Problem, in: The Air Force Law Review, vol. 68, 198 (2012). Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 399 es. For example, cyber interference with the payload control of a satellite or space probe may have no safety impact, but affect the on-board applications⁹ and render its purpose useless. The identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹² ## B. Air Law¹³ In aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security: - non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems, - safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and - flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft. 9 For example communication, navigation, remote sensing, scientific research. 10 Traditionally, States are not considered responsible for the acts of persons or a group of persons not acting on behalf of the State. This is reflected in the International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83 (2001), Annex, Article 11. 11 Healey, Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks, in: Atlantic Council, Issue Brief, (2012). 12 Activities' in 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China's Cyber Activities, at 149-151, http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/2012-Report-to-Congress.pdf. \"While it's very difficult in cyber to have a 'smoking gun', so to speak, the clear paths back into servers and other mechanical devices inside of the Chinese sovereign domain remain a constant problem for us [the U.S. defense establishment].\" Vice Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright, id. at 153. 13 For more details see Kaiser / Aretz, Legal Protection of Civil and Military Aviation against Cyber Interference, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4. 14 Airline data bases hold large amounts of sensitive personal information which are exchanged internationally, see also Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Council of the European Union, 2011/0382 (NLE). ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles The second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage. In 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice: “Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵ This recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation. ## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety Any future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems. Cyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected. ## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure Air Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network ¹⁵ Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1. ¹⁶ To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 401 (AFTN) is the communications backbone of ATM for which interoperability is of essence.¹⁷ Technically the most secure solution for the security of such kind of a network would be full physical separation from other network hardware including the internet. This does not appear to be feasible, which leaves only the standard technical means of protection like encryption and fire-walls. Nevertheless, technical measures for critical aviation infrastructure like CNS-ATM need to be flanked by regulation to ensure cyber security in a dynamic and pro-active manner that reaches beyond existing safety regulations.¹⁸ The vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation.¹⁹ It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure²⁰ in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure²¹ which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.²² ## III. Critical Aircraft Systems Cyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks. Therefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi- ¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation). ¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers). ¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208. ²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15. ²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS. ²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified: - Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and - they should not be interconnected to external networks. COTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems. Connectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous ²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15. ²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee). ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 403 non-safety functions available in aircraft like Aeronautical Passenger Communication (APC) and on-board entertainment systems. Unauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵ ## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law Different to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators. In the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space. ²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250. ²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137. ²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309. ²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181. ²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178. ³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles # C. Space Law³¹ In space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference: - the terrestrial segment - the space segment and - peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres. Space systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities.³² Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities.³³ The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments³⁴. Different to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted³⁵. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and ³¹ For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4. ³² In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/. ³³ In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

Unauthorized cyber activities may have various effects on space systems, depending if they are intended: - to access or retrieve information produced by the payload of a space object (e.g. data generated by a remote sensing or communication satellite without authorisation); - to disrupt the transmission of information (by degrading or altering the data or blocking the transmission or reception, e.g. of communication, navigation or remote sensing signals); - to damage or destroy a space object’s on board computer systems, software or hardware (e.g. through malware); - to seize a space object by manipulating its flight control, possibly resulting in damage to the space object itself and also to third parties (e.g. depletion of limited satellite resources, changing the attitude control³⁶ or trajectory of the space object to cause profit loss, collisions with another space object, launch accidents or atmospheric re-entry and damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight)³⁷. ## I. State Responsibility and Liability for Space Activities Due to the high risks to the Earth’s environment, and persons and property on the Earth and the catastrophic damage³⁸ that may unfold on the surface of the Earth with only short warning time,³⁹ space activities are considered as Jet Propulsion Laboratory also suffered an attack that compromised its computer network; see 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China’s Cyber Activities, 155. ³⁶ A satellite’s ‘attitude control’ is necessary to maintain sensors and other instruments aligned in a specific position, in order to perform certain tasks as maintaining communication with Earth stations. See 6.2.4.2. Attitude Control, ITU, Handbook on Satellite Communications, (2002), 369-370. ³⁷ In such scenarios, the perpetrator needs to possess specific knowledge on confidential information of a satellite’s hardware, command structure, signal frequency, modulation, data rate, etc. Huber, DLR, personal communication with the author, 9 October 2013. In the present trend of confidential information theft, there is a growing probability of acquiring information to manipulate the flight control of space objects for unauthorized seizure. ³⁸ ‘Damage’ is defined in Liability Convention Art. 1 (a) as ‘[...]loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organizations [...]’. ³⁹ ‘[...] any damage is likely to occur swiftly and may often be catastrophic.’ Lyall / Larsen, Space Law, A Treatise (2009), 66. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ‘ultra-hazardous’ activities.⁴⁰ The Outer Space Treaty of 1967⁴¹ and the Liability Convention of 1973⁴² establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility⁴³ and liability⁴⁴ for outer space activities. Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷. Although the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of ⁴⁰ Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

Two scenarios need to be distinguished: unauthorized cyber activities against the flight control or the payload control of a space object. ## II. Flight Control Interference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰ Therefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:",

Payload Control Unauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention⁵⁶: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information. ⁵⁵ See paragraph 2) above. ⁵⁶ Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011). ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ## D. Conclusion Aviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law. ZLW 64.

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser**\n## Introduction\nThe 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law\nAirspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet or remain very general.\n---\n* LL.M.

See for example UNGA Res. 68/243 - Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But\n There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nthis is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States. Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments. Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.\n## B. Air Law\nIn aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security:\n- non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems and airport luggage transport systems,\n- safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and\n- flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nThe second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice:\n“Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”\nThis recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls. More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety\nAny future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.\nCyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.\n## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure\nAir Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network\n Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.\n To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nThe vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation. It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.\n## III. Critical Aircraft Systems\nCyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi-\n See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security. Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions. For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified:\n- Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and\n- they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous\n For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nUnauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.\n## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law\nDifferent to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929 and the Montreal Convention of 1999 have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952 and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971 is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage. However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n# C. Space Law\nIn space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference:\n- the terrestrial segment\n- the space segment and\n- peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities. Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities. The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and\n For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\nUnauthorized cyber activities may have various effects on space systems, depending if they are intended:\n- to access or retrieve information produced by the payload of a space object (e.g. data generated by a remote sensing or communication satellite without authorisation);\n- to disrupt the transmission of information (by degrading or altering the data or blocking the transmission or reception, e.g. of communication, navigation or remote sensing signals);\n- to damage or destroy a space object’s on board computer systems, software or hardware (e.g. through malware);\n- to seize a space object by manipulating its flight control, possibly resulting in damage to the space object itself and also to third parties (e.g. depletion of limited satellite resources, changing the attitude control or trajectory of the space object to cause profit loss, collisions with another space object, launch accidents or atmospheric re-entry and damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight).\n## I. State Responsibility and Liability for Space Activities\nDue to the high risks to the Earth’s environment, and persons and property on the Earth and the catastrophic damage that may unfold on the surface of the Earth with only short warning time, space activities are considered as\nJet Propulsion Laboratory also suffered an attack that compromised its computer network; see 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China’s Cyber Activities, 155.\n A satellite’s ‘attitude control’ is necessary to maintain sensors and other instruments aligned in a specific position, in order to perform certain tasks as maintaining communication with Earth stations. See 6.2.4.2. Attitude Control, ITU, Handbook on Satellite Communications, (2002), 369-370.\n In such scenarios, the perpetrator needs to possess specific knowledge on confidential information of a satellite’s hardware, command structure, signal frequency, modulation, data rate, etc. Huber, DLR, personal communication with the author, 9 October 2013. In the present trend of confidential information theft, there is a growing probability of acquiring information to manipulate the flight control of space objects for unauthorized seizure.\n ‘Damage’ is defined in Liability Convention Art. 1 (a) as ‘[...]loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organizations [...]’.\n ‘[...] any damage is likely to occur swiftly and may often be catastrophic.’ Lyall / Larsen, Space Law, A Treatise (2009), 66.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n‘ultra-hazardous’ activities. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Liability Convention of 1973 establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility and liability for outer space activities. Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly, during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of\n Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

VI of the Outer Space Treaty, supra note 41: ‘States Party to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space [...] whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions of set for in the present Treaty.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\n## II. Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n1. States should agree on the primary responsibility to refrain from tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging in whatever\n The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...]. The militants, authors of the invasion and jailers of the hostages, had now become agents of the Iranian State for whose acts the State itself was internationally re-\nZLW 64.

The authorization and supervision of States under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty need to be expanded to cover cyber security of flight control. National legislation and enforcement need to set the legal parameters of States' 'continued supervision', possibly by reference to international technical recommendations, to protect space systems against unauthorized cyber activities, like ITU recommendations53 or standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)54 and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n3. A neutral body may help to share information on cyber threats to space systems, to collect evidence that may serve as proof of unauthorized cyber acts and also to help and support victim States in efforts to neutralize such dangers.\n4. Regardless of the responsibility and liability of the launching State, also such States should be responsible and (absolutely) liable for national cyber activities that lead a space segment of another State to cause damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. This responsibility and liability should apply for activities by governmental or non-governmental entities and encompass compensation for damages to the launching State and to third-party States that suffer damage in their territory or to their aircraft in flight.\nsponsible\".

Evolving technical standards adopted and implemented by Launching States as part of their ‘continued supervision’ can serve as an indicator of a launching State’s due care in the context of fault-based liability under Article III of the Liability Convention.\n7. Launching States who have become the target of unauthorized cyber activities that affect the flight control of their space objects need to undertake all reasonable actions to prevent or halt such interference with its national space objects by using their own technical means or by requesting the assistance of other States to avert impending dangers.\n8. State need to inform the international community of cyber security threats that can affect space objects and may consequently lead to loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or property damage.\n## III. Payload Control\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n See paragraph 2) above.\n Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n## D. Conclusion\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser**\n## Introduction\nThe 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law\nAirspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet¹ or remain very general.²\n---\n* LL.M.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n397\nOur everyday environment becomes increasingly dependent on information technologies and thus on cyber space.³ Initially computers were expensive and monstrous, so that only a limited number of ‘mainframes’ existed for specialized scientific, industrial, military and state purposes. During the 1970s personal computers became affordable for everyone in the Western world and were perceived as a step towards democratization of information technologies. The subsequent networking of personal computers via the emerging internet was understood as a technical means to boost the freedom of speech, similar to Gutenberg’s printing press in the 15th century. Today we know that electronic information networks can work in two ways, not only as a support of the freedom of speech, but also as a means to exploit, manipulate and control information. Cyber activities consist of access to computer systems for retrieving or introducing packages of data and/or computer software programs (to execute a specific task when activated).⁴ Unauthorized⁵ cyber activities may be used to destroy not only the software and hardware of the prey computer, but also misuse the seized computers to produce further damage to third parties, including physical damage to individuals or property.⁶ Cyber security is to protect the integrity of electronic data and to prevent its unauthorized use. It encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. National rules, for example on privacy of information, cannot cope with the international characteristics of cyber space. Information in networks is processed and stored by data transfers worldwide. The territorial scope of national rules is too narrow, as it can unfold its legal effect only in those portions of the cyber infrastructure located within the given State.\nThe purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But\n³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nthis is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n7 The term cyber-attack is used here in a purely technical sense in a peace time scenario and not in the meaning of armed conflict.\n8 Segregated or ‘air gapped’ networks means to secure computer networks by isolating them “… both physically and electromagnetically”, see *Mudrinich*, Cyber 3.0: The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the Attribution Problem, in: The Air Force Law Review, vol. 68, 198 (2012).\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n399\nes. For example, cyber interference with the payload control of a satellite or space probe may have no safety impact, but affect the on-board applications⁹ and render its purpose useless.\nThe identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹²\n## B. Air Law¹³\nIn aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security:\n- non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems,\n- safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and\n- flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\n9 For example communication, navigation, remote sensing, scientific research.\n10 Traditionally, States are not considered responsible for the acts of persons or a group of persons not acting on behalf of the State. This is reflected in the International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83 (2001), Annex, Article 11.\n11 Healey, Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks, in: Atlantic Council, Issue Brief, (2012).\n12 Activities' in 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China's Cyber Activities, at 149-151, http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/2012-Report-to-Congress.pdf. \"While it's very difficult in cyber to have a 'smoking gun', so to speak, the clear paths back into servers and other mechanical devices inside of the Chinese sovereign domain remain a constant problem for us [the U.S. defense establishment].\" Vice Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright, id. at 153.\n13 For more details see Kaiser / Aretz, Legal Protection of Civil and Military Aviation against Cyber Interference, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n14 Airline data bases hold large amounts of sensitive personal information which are exchanged internationally, see also Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Council of the European Union, 2011/0382 (NLE).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nThe second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice:\n“Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵\nThis recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety\nAny future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.\nCyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.\n## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure\nAir Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network\n¹⁵ Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.\n¹⁶ To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n401\n(AFTN) is the communications backbone of ATM for which interoperability is of essence.¹⁷ Technically the most secure solution for the security of such kind of a network would be full physical separation from other network hardware including the internet. This does not appear to be feasible, which leaves only the standard technical means of protection like encryption and fire-walls. Nevertheless, technical measures for critical aviation infrastructure like CNS-ATM need to be flanked by regulation to ensure cyber security in a dynamic and pro-active manner that reaches beyond existing safety regulations.¹⁸\nThe vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation.¹⁹ It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure²⁰ in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure²¹ which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.²²\n## III. Critical Aircraft Systems\nCyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi-\n¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\nness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified:\n- Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and\n- they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous\n²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64.

Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵\n## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law\nDifferent to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64.

Space Law³¹\nIn space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference:\n- the terrestrial segment\n- the space segment and\n- peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities.³² Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities.³³ The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments³⁴.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted³⁵. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and\n³¹ For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n³² In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n³³ In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

See 6.2.4.2.

Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of\n⁴⁰ Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

VI of the Outer Space Treaty, supra note 41: ‘States Party to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space [...] whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions of set for in the present Treaty.

Two scenarios need to be distinguished: unauthorized cyber activities against the flight control or the payload control of a space object.\n## II. Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n1. States should agree on the primary responsibility to refrain from tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging⁵¹ in whatever\n⁴⁹ The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n⁵⁰ For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n⁵¹ In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...]. The militants, authors of the invasion and jailers of the hostages, had now become agents of the Iranian State for whose acts the State itself was internationally re-\nZLW 64.

The authorization and supervision of States under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty need to be expanded to cover cyber security of flight control. National legislation and enforcement need to set the legal parameters of States' 'continued supervision', possibly by reference to international technical recommendations, to protect space systems against unauthorized cyber activities, like ITU recommendations53 or standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)54 and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n3. A neutral body may help to share information on cyber threats to space systems, to collect evidence that may serve as proof of unauthorized cyber acts and also to help and support victim States in efforts to neutralize such dangers.\n4. Regardless of the responsibility and liability of the launching State, also such States should be responsible and (absolutely) liable for national cyber activities that lead a space segment of another State to cause damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. This responsibility and liability should apply for activities by governmental or non-governmental entities and encompass compensation for damages to the launching State and to third-party States that suffer damage in their territory or to their aircraft in flight.\nsponsible\". United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Judgement (United States of America v. Iran) I.C.J. Rep. 1980, para. 74.\n52 Of course, a State that tolerates, encourages, coordinates and/or engages in damaging cyber activities would deny attribution. Nevertheless, it is possible to make a strong case against such State with compelling evidence, see U.S. Department of Defense for the First Time Attributes Cyber Espionage to China, in: 2013 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 245, http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Annual_Report/Chapters/Chapter %202%3B%20Section%202%20China%27s%20Cyber%20Activities.pdf. \"When confronted with public accusations from the United States about its cyber espionage, Beijing attempted to refute the evidence, in part, by pointing to the anonymity of cyberspace and the lack of verifiable technical forensic data.

Despite these accusations, China \"[...] suffers the largest number of cyberattacks in the world\" and some of past important malicious cyber activities originated from the US.

Jg. 2/2015\nKaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n409\n5. States who fail to comply with their supervisory obligations or by actively tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging in cyber activities should be deemed responsible in the sense of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and be considered at fault for liability regarding loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or damage to property on board of a seized space objects and also to further damage in outer space to a third State.\n6. Evolving technical standards adopted and implemented by Launching States as part of their ‘continued supervision’⁵⁵ can serve as an indicator of a launching State’s due care in the context of fault-based liability under Article III of the Liability Convention.\n7. Launching States who have become the target of unauthorized cyber activities that affect the flight control of their space objects need to undertake all reasonable actions to prevent or halt such interference with its national space objects by using their own technical means or by requesting the assistance of other States to avert impending dangers.\n8. State need to inform the international community of cyber security threats that can affect space objects and may consequently lead to loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or property damage.\n## III. Payload Control\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention⁵⁶: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n⁵⁵ See paragraph 2) above.\n⁵⁶ Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n## D. Conclusion\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 397 Our everyday environment becomes increasingly dependent on information technologies and thus on cyber space.³ Initially computers were expensive and monstrous, so that only a limited number of ‘mainframes’ existed for specialized scientific, industrial, military and state purposes. During the 1970s personal computers became affordable for everyone in the Western world and were perceived as a step towards democratization of information technologies. The subsequent networking of personal computers via the emerging internet was understood as a technical means to boost the freedom of speech, similar to Gutenberg’s printing press in the 15th century. Today we know that electronic information networks can work in two ways, not only as a support of the freedom of speech, but also as a means to exploit, manipulate and control information. Cyber activities consist of access to computer systems for retrieving or introducing packages of data and/or computer software programs (to execute a specific task when activated).⁴ Unauthorized⁵ cyber activities may be used to destroy not only the software and hardware of the prey computer, but also misuse the seized computers to produce further damage to third parties, including physical damage to individuals or property.⁶ Cyber security is to protect the integrity of electronic data and to prevent its unauthorized use. It encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. National rules, for example on privacy of information, cannot cope with the international characteristics of cyber space. Information in networks is processed and stored by data transfers worldwide. The territorial scope of national rules is too narrow, as it can unfold its legal effect only in those portions of the cyber infrastructure located within the given State. The purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But ³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf. ⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350. ⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system. ⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles this is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. The protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain. Different to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft. Unauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface. In aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 7 The term cyber-attack is used here in a purely technical sense in a peace time scenario and not in the meaning of armed conflict. 8 Segregated or ‘air gapped’ networks means to secure computer networks by isolating them “… both physically and electromagnetically”, see *Mudrinich*, Cyber 3.0: The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the Attribution Problem, in: The Air Force Law Review, vol. 68, 198 (2012). Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 399 es. For example, cyber interference with the payload control of a satellite or space probe may have no safety impact, but affect the on-board applications⁹ and render its purpose useless. The identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹² ## B. Air Law¹³ In aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security: - non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems, - safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and - flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft. 9 For example communication, navigation, remote sensing, scientific research. 10 Traditionally, States are not considered responsible for the acts of persons or a group of persons not acting on behalf of the State. This is reflected in the International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83 (2001), Annex, Article 11. 11 Healey, Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks, in: Atlantic Council, Issue Brief, (2012). 12 Activities' in 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China's Cyber Activities, at 149-151, http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/2012-Report-to-Congress.pdf. \"While it's very difficult in cyber to have a 'smoking gun', so to speak, the clear paths back into servers and other mechanical devices inside of the Chinese sovereign domain remain a constant problem for us [the U.S. defense establishment].\" Vice Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright, id. at 153. 13 For more details see Kaiser / Aretz, Legal Protection of Civil and Military Aviation against Cyber Interference, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4. 14 Airline data bases hold large amounts of sensitive personal information which are exchanged internationally, see also Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Council of the European Union, 2011/0382 (NLE). ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles The second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage. In 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice: “Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵ This recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation. ## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety Any future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems. Cyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected. ## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure Air Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network ¹⁵ Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1. ¹⁶ To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 401 (AFTN) is the communications backbone of ATM for which interoperability is of essence.¹⁷ Technically the most secure solution for the security of such kind of a network would be full physical separation from other network hardware including the internet. This does not appear to be feasible, which leaves only the standard technical means of protection like encryption and fire-walls. Nevertheless, technical measures for critical aviation infrastructure like CNS-ATM need to be flanked by regulation to ensure cyber security in a dynamic and pro-active manner that reaches beyond existing safety regulations.¹⁸ The vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation.¹⁹ It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure²⁰ in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure²¹ which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.²² ## III. Critical Aircraft Systems Cyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks. Therefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi- ¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation). ¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers). ¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208. ²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15. ²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS. ²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified: - Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and - they should not be interconnected to external networks. COTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems. Connectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous ²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15. ²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee). ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law 403 non-safety functions available in aircraft like Aeronautical Passenger Communication (APC) and on-board entertainment systems. Unauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵ ## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law Different to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators. In the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space. ²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250. ²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137. ²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309. ²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181. ²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178. ³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles # C. Space Law³¹ In space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference: - the terrestrial segment - the space segment and - peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres. Space systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities.³² Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities.³³ The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments³⁴. Different to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted³⁵. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and ³¹ For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4. ³² In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/. ³³ In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

Unauthorized cyber activities may have various effects on space systems, depending if they are intended: - to access or retrieve information produced by the payload of a space object (e.g. data generated by a remote sensing or communication satellite without authorisation); - to disrupt the transmission of information (by degrading or altering the data or blocking the transmission or reception, e.g. of communication, navigation or remote sensing signals); - to damage or destroy a space object’s on board computer systems, software or hardware (e.g. through malware); - to seize a space object by manipulating its flight control, possibly resulting in damage to the space object itself and also to third parties (e.g. depletion of limited satellite resources, changing the attitude control³⁶ or trajectory of the space object to cause profit loss, collisions with another space object, launch accidents or atmospheric re-entry and damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight)³⁷. ## I. State Responsibility and Liability for Space Activities Due to the high risks to the Earth’s environment, and persons and property on the Earth and the catastrophic damage³⁸ that may unfold on the surface of the Earth with only short warning time,³⁹ space activities are considered as Jet Propulsion Laboratory also suffered an attack that compromised its computer network; see 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China’s Cyber Activities, 155. ³⁶ A satellite’s ‘attitude control’ is necessary to maintain sensors and other instruments aligned in a specific position, in order to perform certain tasks as maintaining communication with Earth stations. See 6.2.4.2. Attitude Control, ITU, Handbook on Satellite Communications, (2002), 369-370. ³⁷ In such scenarios, the perpetrator needs to possess specific knowledge on confidential information of a satellite’s hardware, command structure, signal frequency, modulation, data rate, etc. Huber, DLR, personal communication with the author, 9 October 2013. In the present trend of confidential information theft, there is a growing probability of acquiring information to manipulate the flight control of space objects for unauthorized seizure. ³⁸ ‘Damage’ is defined in Liability Convention Art. 1 (a) as ‘[...]loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organizations [...]’. ³⁹ ‘[...] any damage is likely to occur swiftly and may often be catastrophic.’ Lyall / Larsen, Space Law, A Treatise (2009), 66. ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ‘ultra-hazardous’ activities.⁴⁰ The Outer Space Treaty of 1967⁴¹ and the Liability Convention of 1973⁴² establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility⁴³ and liability⁴⁴ for outer space activities. Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷. Although the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of ⁴⁰ Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

Two scenarios need to be distinguished: unauthorized cyber activities against the flight control or the payload control of a space object. ## II. Flight Control Interference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰ Therefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:"

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser** ## Introduction The 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law Airspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet¹ or remain very general.² --- * LL.M.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law The purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But ³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles this is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss ZLW 64.

Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi- ¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified: - Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and - they should not be interconnected to external networks.\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous ²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law Unauthorized cyber interference with safety-critical aircraft systems is another area for regulatory measures. Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵ ## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law Different to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation, not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles # C. Space Law³¹ In space activities three areas are vulnerable to cyber interference: - the terrestrial segment - the space segment and - peripheral systems necessary for the operation of space systems, like those operated by space agencies, satellite integrators, space debris data bases and conjunction assessment centres.\nSpace systems have been victims of unauthorized cyber activities in various ways. For example, the computer systems of the terrestrial segments (e.g. earth stations receiving or sending data) can become the gateways for such activities.³² Also air gapped space segments have been objects of unauthorized cyber activities.³³ The use of radio signals is another method of gaining unauthorized electronic access to a space system. This can be achieved through electromagnetic signals directed to a satellite, for example by placing transmission antennas close to existing ones with direct access to space segments³⁴.\nDifferent to cyber activities directed against space systems, the networks of space agencies or other institutions involved in space programs can also be targeted³⁵. Such activities can divulge sensitive information on the design and ³¹ For more details see Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorised Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n³² In 2008 it was claimed that a cyber-activity against the operation center of Norwegian Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) gave unauthorized access to a satellite of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Leyden, Inside the Mysterious US Satellite Hacking Case, in: The Register, 21 Nov. 2011, http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/us_sat_hack_mystery/.\n³³ In 2008 two computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) were infected by malware unintentionally transmitted by an astronaut's USB drive (Universal Serial Bus) and gave access to intruders via radio links.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law Unauthorized cyber activities may have various effects on space systems, depending if they are intended: - to access or retrieve information produced by the payload of a space object (e.g. data generated by a remote sensing or communication satellite without authorisation); - to disrupt the transmission of information (by degrading or altering the data or blocking the transmission or reception, e.g. of communication, navigation or remote sensing signals); - to damage or destroy a space object’s on board computer systems, software or hardware (e.g. through malware); - to seize a space object by manipulating its flight control, possibly resulting in damage to the space object itself and also to third parties (e.g. depletion of limited satellite resources, changing the attitude control³⁶ or trajectory of the space object to cause profit loss, collisions with another space object, launch accidents or atmospheric re-entry and damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight)³⁷.\n## I. State Responsibility and Liability for Space Activities Due to the high risks to the Earth’s environment, and persons and property on the Earth and the catastrophic damage³⁸ that may unfold on the surface of the Earth with only short warning time,³⁹ space activities are considered as Jet Propulsion Laboratory also suffered an attack that compromised its computer network; see 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China’s Cyber Activities, 155.\n³⁶ A satellite’s ‘attitude control’ is necessary to maintain sensors and other instruments aligned in a specific position, in order to perform certain tasks as maintaining communication with Earth stations. See 6.2.4.2. Attitude Control, ITU, Handbook on Satellite Communications, (2002), 369-370.\n³⁷ In such scenarios, the perpetrator needs to possess specific knowledge on confidential information of a satellite’s hardware, command structure, signal frequency, modulation, data rate, etc. Huber, DLR, personal communication with the author, 9 October 2013. In the present trend of confidential information theft, there is a growing probability of acquiring information to manipulate the flight control of space objects for unauthorized seizure.\n³⁸ ‘Damage’ is defined in Liability Convention Art. 1 (a) as ‘[...]loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health; loss of or damage to property of States or of persons, natural or juridical, or property of international intergovernmental organizations [...]’.\n³⁹ ‘[...] any damage is likely to occur swiftly and may often be catastrophic.’ Lyall / Larsen, Space Law, A Treatise (2009), 66.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles ‘ultra-hazardous’ activities.⁴⁰ The Outer Space Treaty of 1967⁴¹ and the Liability Convention of 1973⁴² establish therefore a special framework for State responsibility⁴³ and liability⁴⁴ for outer space activities. Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷.\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of. Responsibility and liability will become the main point of conflict when unauthorized cyber activities affect space objects. One of the assumptions underlying Article VI and of the Outer Space Treaty is that the launching State has flight control of ⁴⁰ Lachs, The Law of Outer Space, An Experience in Contemporary Law-Making, XIII, 113-124 (1972, reprinted in 2010).

VI of the Outer Space Treaty, supra note 41: ‘States Party to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space [...] whether such activities are carried on by governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions of set for in the present Treaty. The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space [...] shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty [...]’.\n⁴⁶ ‘Launching State’ is defined in Art. 1 (c) of the Liability Convention as ‘(i) A State which launches or procures the launching of a space object; (ii) A State from whose territory or facility a space object is launched’.\n⁴⁷ Art. 2 of the Liability Convention: ‘A launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensation for damages caused by its space object on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight.’ ⁴⁸ Hobe, Art I, Outer Space Treaty, in: Cologne Commentary on Space Law, supra note 3, p. 34.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n\n## II. Flight Control\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n\n⁴⁹ The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n⁵⁰ For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n⁵¹ In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...].

Payload Control\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention⁵⁶: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n⁵⁵ See paragraph 2) above.\n⁵⁶ Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\nArticles\n## D. Conclusion\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64.

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser** ## Introduction The 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet¹ or remain very general.² --- * LL.M.

Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law The purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But ³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles this is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss ZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law The identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹² ## B. Air Law¹³ In aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security: - non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems, - safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and - flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015 Articles The second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice: “Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵ This recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice.

Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n### I.

Kaiser* and Martha Mejía-Kaiser**\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe 90th anniversary of the Cologne Institute of Air and Space Law is an occasion to look forward to the future challenges of air and space law. Cyber security is one of them. Aviation and space applications increasingly depend on information technologies. These technologies are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Cyber security encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. Such regulation needs to find its way into air and space law in a timely manner, while technology is progressing. This article elaborates on principles and regulatory approaches to cyber security in air and space law.\n\n## A. Cyber Activities and the Law\n\nAirspace and outer space are natural mediums. Air law and space law created legal regimes for the use and administration of these mediums and the applicable jurisdiction. Both legal regimes establish an international order for which States are the key players. Yet the two are fundamentally different and have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nCyber space is an artificial, man-made medium. It is based on physical infrastructure like computers and communication links located in the territory of States, but also in international spaces like the high seas and outer space. Existing international legal approaches to cyber space tend to focus on privacy and crimes committed through the internet¹ or remain very general.²\n\n---\n\n* LL.M.

    "Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n397\n\nOur everyday environment becomes increasingly dependent on information technologies and thus on cyber space.³ Initially computers were expensive and monstrous, so that only a limited number of ‘mainframes’ existed for specialized scientific, industrial, military and state purposes. During the 1970s personal computers became affordable for everyone in the Western world and were perceived as a step towards democratization of information technologies. The subsequent networking of personal computers via the emerging internet was understood as a technical means to boost the freedom of speech, similar to Gutenberg’s printing press in the 15th century. Today we know that electronic information networks can work in two ways, not only as a support of the freedom of speech, but also as a means to exploit, manipulate and control information. Cyber activities consist of access to computer systems for retrieving or introducing packages of data and/or computer software programs (to execute a specific task when activated).⁴ Unauthorized⁵ cyber activities may be used to destroy not only the software and hardware of the prey computer, but also misuse the seized computers to produce further damage to third parties, including physical damage to individuals or property.⁶ Cyber security is to protect the integrity of electronic data and to prevent its unauthorized use. It encompasses not only technical measures, but also requires a regulatory framework. National rules, for example on privacy of information, cannot cope with the international characteristics of cyber space. Information in networks is processed and stored by data transfers worldwide. The territorial scope of national rules is too narrow, as it can unfold its legal effect only in those portions of the cyber infrastructure located within the given State.\n\nThe purpose of cyber security is the protection of fundamental rights. In this context, reference is typically made to the right of privacy of personal and commercial information and intellectual property. One problem is that national concepts of privacy and data protection differ from State to State. But\n\n³ There is no internationally agreed definition of “cyber-space”. The US Air Force defines it as “a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers”, US Air Force Doctrine, Annex 3-12, Cyber Operations, Introduction, 30 Nov 2011, https://doctrine.af.mil/download.jsp?filename=3-12-D01-CYBER-Introduction.pdf.\n\n⁴ Maybaum, Technical Methods, Techniques, Tools and Effects of Cyber Operations, in: Ziolkowski (ed.), Peacetime Regime for State Activities in Cyberspace. International Law, International Relations and Diplomacy, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence Publication, Tallinn, Estonia (2013), 103 and 112. Mejía-Kaiser, Space Law and Unauthorized Cyber Activities, in: Ziolkowski, ibid, 350.\n\n⁵ ‘Unauthorized’ means here cyber activities without the consent of the authorized owner/operator of the computer system.\n\n⁶ Such malicious cyber activities need to be distinguished from physical attacks against the physical computer and network infrastructure, which can also effect the proper operation of computers and networks, but are not launched through cyber space.\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015",
    "Articles\n\nthis is not the only problem. The scope of the legal protection reaches farther than privacy. Computers, networks and, more generally cyber space, are also used for controlling machinery and devices in areas like industry, commerce, transportation, medicine, military and public services. Unauthorized interference with computerized controls of safety relevant functions is a matter of physical security and may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property.\n\nThe protection and integrity of safety relevant functions and critical infrastructure are the main points of concern of cyber security in aviation and space flight. Aviation and space technology were at the forefront of mobile computers, automation and remote control. As high end applications they were the first to benefit from solid-state technology, leading from transistors, to integrated circuits and micro-processors. Non-interoperable information technology platforms and the absence of online connectivity of safety relevant aircraft functionalities prevented unauthorized cyber interference. However, after several decades of stand-alone soft- and hardware platforms, technical developments are leading into a different direction. Soft- and hardware of general applications are increasingly finding their way into aviation and space technology, from the design stage to the final component provided through the supply chain.\n\nDifferent to aviation, space flight has been depending on radio remote control from the very beginning. Today the computer systems of about 1000 operational space objects are radio linked to Earth Stations and these Earth stations are at the same time interconnected with providers of services and users. For many years interconnection of space flight control links with 'outside' networks did not pose a problem, because space technology was far ahead of other ground based systems. This is changing and poses vulnerabilities, also in aviation. In-flight network connectivity for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has become a reality, albeit not (yet) for the flight control of manned aircraft.\n\nUnauthorized cyber interference and cyber-attacks⁷ are accomplished not only through unauthorized internet access, but also through segregated⁸ landline and wireless networks and portable storage media. Existing network interfaces may be used without authorization or, technically more complex, electromagnetic access can directly be established wirelessly without using an established interface.\n\nIn aviation and space technology cyber interference with safety relevant flight controls is undoubtedly the most critical. But also cyber-attacks on non-safety systems can be substantial and lead to disruption of services and financial loss\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015\n\n7 The term cyber-attack is used here in a purely technical sense in a peace time scenario and not in the meaning of armed conflict.\n\n8 Segregated or ‘air gapped’ networks means to secure computer networks by isolating them “… both physically and electromagnetically”, see *Mudrinich*, Cyber 3.0: The Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace and the Attribution Problem, in: The Air Force Law Review, vol. 68, 198 (2012).",

For example, cyber interference with the payload control of a satellite or space probe may have no safety impact, but affect the on-board applications⁹ and render its purpose useless.\n\nThe identification of perpetrators and their locations are generally considered as a great obstacle to attribute unauthorized cyber activities to States.¹⁰ Nevertheless, some malicious cyber activities that require the coordination and involvement of a large group of persons give hints on the complicity of governments.¹¹ Studies have shown that it is possible to allocate the origin of large-scale malicious cyber-attacks to States.¹²\n\n## B. Air Law¹³\n\nIn aviation three principally different areas vulnerable to cyber interference and attacks can be distinguished, which merit different technical and legal measures for cyber security:\n\n- non-safety relevant ground infrastructure with an impact on the regularity and efficiency of air traffic, for example airline booking and reservation systems¹⁴ and airport luggage transport systems,\n- safety relevant aviation infrastructure, for example communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) systems and air traffic management (ATM), and\n- flight controls and navigation of manned and remotely-piloted aircraft.\n\n9 For example communication, navigation, remote sensing, scientific research.\n10 Traditionally, States are not considered responsible for the acts of persons or a group of persons not acting on behalf of the State. This is reflected in the International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83 (2001), Annex, Article 11.\n11 Healey, Beyond Attribution: Seeking National Responsibility for Cyber Attacks, in: Atlantic Council, Issue Brief, (2012).\n12 Activities' in 2012 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 112th Congress, 2nd Session (Nov. 2012), Section II, China's Cyber Activities, at 149-151, http://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/2012-Report-to-Congress.pdf. \"While it's very difficult in cyber to have a 'smoking gun', so to speak, the clear paths back into servers and other mechanical devices inside of the Chinese sovereign domain remain a constant problem for us [the U.S. defense establishment].\" Vice Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright, id. at 153.\n13 For more details see Kaiser / Aretz, Legal Protection of Civil and Military Aviation against Cyber Interference, in: Ziolkowski, supra note 4.\n14 Airline data bases hold large amounts of sensitive personal information which are exchanged internationally, see also Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the use and transfer of passenger name records to the United States Department of Homeland Security, Council of the European Union, 2011/0382 (NLE).\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015",
    "Articles\n\nThe second and third areas are safety-relevant and therefore require aviation specific technical and regulatory cyber security measures. At the moment such regulation has not even reached an embryonic stage.\n\nIn 2011 Annex 17 of the Chicago Convention on security was amended by the following recommended practice:\n\n“Each Contracting State should develop measures in order to protect information and communication technology systems used for civil aviation purposes from interference that may jeopardize the safety of civil aviation.”¹⁵\n\nThis recommendation is only a starting point. It needs to be elaborated to become a comprehensive set of rules covering specific cyber security measures and procedures for safety relevant aviation infrastructure and aircraft flight controls.¹⁶ More important, States need to implement national regulation for cyber security in civil aviation.\n\n## I. Cyber Security as Opposed to Safety\n\nAny future cyber security rule must reach beyond safety rules that exist already for the protection against electromagnetic interference of electronic hardware, software and network protocols. The risk assessment for cyber security is stricter than for safety. Cyber security needs to assure with reasonable probability that an attacker cannot intentionally exploit a security gap of safety critical systems. For flight safety it is sufficient to demonstrate with reasonable probability that non-intentional electromagnetic interference will not interfere with flight-critical aircraft systems.\n\nCyber security also requires coping with a critical timing issue. Devices intentionally used for interference stemming from mainstream electronics can be younger and more sophisticated than aviation electronics, which has to pass a lengthy certification process. The tools of intentional interference can progress more quickly than the aviation systems to be protected.\n\n## II. Critical Aviation Infrastructure\n\nAir Traffic Management (ATM) is perhaps the most safety critical portion of aviation infrastructure. The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network\n\n¹⁵ Annex 17 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), 15 U.N.T.S. 295, sec. 4.9: Measures relating to cyber threats, Recommendation 4.9.1.\n\n¹⁶ To this end the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Airports Council International (ACI), the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industry Associations (ICCAIA) agreed on a common roadmap against “hackers, ‘hacktivists’, cyber criminals and terrorists now focused on malicious intent ranging from the theft of information and general disruption to potential loss of life”, ICAO News Release, aviation Unites on Cyber Threat, 10 December 2014.\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015",
    "Kaiser / Mejía-Kaiser / Cyber Security in Air and Space Law\n401\n\n(AFTN) is the communications backbone of ATM for which interoperability is of essence.¹⁷ Technically the most secure solution for the security of such kind of a network would be full physical separation from other network hardware including the internet. This does not appear to be feasible, which leaves only the standard technical means of protection like encryption and fire-walls. Nevertheless, technical measures for critical aviation infrastructure like CNS-ATM need to be flanked by regulation to ensure cyber security in a dynamic and pro-active manner that reaches beyond existing safety regulations.¹⁸\n\nThe vulnerability of radio navigation systems against jamming and spoofing can be reduced by maintaining the concepts of redundancy and system diversity, which have been key elements in the safety culture of aviation.¹⁹ It must be avoided to follow the philosophy of integrated solutions which is standard in information technologies, but more vulnerable to cyber interference. Therefore States need to formulate policies to meet their responsibilities for providing air navigation infrastructure²⁰ in a safe and secure way by assuring redundancy and diversity of systems. Practically this means that States should maintain a minimum level of ground-based radio navigation infrastructure²¹ which is independent of satellite navigation systems, because the low signal levels of satellite navigation are vulnerable to cyber interference.²²\n\n## III. Critical Aircraft Systems\n\nCyber interference with the flight controls of aircraft are at the moment not yet a high risk area. Nevertheless policies on aircraft design and regulation should be proactive to address the development of remote control, flight automation and autonomy. The safety of modern aircraft is already highly dependent on airborne computers and networks with a direct link to the mechanical flight controls by technologies like fly-by-wire. Technically it would only be a small step to link safety critical on-board systems with ground based networks and thus to expose the physically segregated airborne systems to the cyber vulnerabilities of existing ground based networks.\n\nTherefore States should consider *de lege ferenda* to mandate that protection against cyber interference becomes part of the certification of the airworthi-\n\n¹⁷ See also Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 (Interoperability Regulation).\n\n¹⁸ See also Article 6.2 of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 29/2009 (Requirements for data link services for the single European sky); and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 482/2008 (Software safety assurance system to be implemented by air navigation service providers).\n\n¹⁹ For details see *Kaiser*, Automation and Limits of Human Performance: Potential Factors in Aviation Accidents, ZLW 2013, 207-208.\n\n²⁰ In accordance with Article 28 of the Chicago Convention, *supra* note 15.\n\n²¹ Like VOR, DME and ILS.\n\n²² For details see *Kaiser*, Satellite Navigation Systems: The Impact of Interoperability, Annals of Air and Space Law XXXVII, 2012, 369.\n\nZLW 64.

    "Articles\n\nness of aircraft. Some design elements of aircraft are already driven by physical security.²³ Likewise the design of an aircraft’s computer and network components need to cover cyber security aspects as airworthiness requirements for the certification process. States need to set minimum requirements for the managerial, operational and technical (cyber) security measures. They need to engage more directly in these matters and cannot just leave to private bodies the standardisation of IT components, also in aircraft safety critical functions.²⁴ For many years the design of information technology was missing cyber security elements. States bear the ultimate responsibility for security, including cyber security in aviation. They need to exercise their regulatory prerogative and policy making to counter-act security shortfalls in critical electronic aircraft components. Regulation specific to cyber security in aircraft design still needs to be developed, but so far two principle elements can already be identified:\n\n- Safety critical aircraft functions should not depend on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components and\n- they should not be interconnected to external networks.\n\nCOTS hardware and software complicate the quality management of components provided through the commercial supply chain, and also create gateways for cyber interference. If aircraft systems are opened to COTS hard- and software, existing malware can find its way into aircraft systems, which have so far depended on specialized components and are thus resistant to common malware. Embedded COTS interconnection functionalities like Ethernet, wireless local area networks (WLAN) and bluetooth can become hidden back doors for cyber interference, when integrated into safety critical systems.\n\nConnectivity of networks is understood as a crucial element of information technologies, but it also enables access for unauthorized cyber interference. While safety critical electronic flight controls are isolated computer and network ‘islands’ today, this segregation needs to be maintained for the purpose of cyber security. Should a remote control capability be established for manned aircraft, like for Unmanned Aircraft systems, the pilot in command’s final control over all remote inputs must be preserved, so that his control inputs cannot be circumvented through wireless data links. This effort requires a functional and physical segregation of safety critical systems from numerous\n\n²³ For example the least risk bomb location, the protection of the flight crew compartment, and interior design features to deter the concealment of weapons, see Chapter 11 (Security – Airworthiness of Aircraft) of Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention, supra note 15.\n\n²⁴ For example Eurocae/RTCA (aircraft/avionics manufacturing standards), A4A (Airlines for America) DSWG (Digital Security Working Group), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute), AEEC (Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee).\n\nZLW 64.

Unfortunately, the expanded use of Portable Electronic Devices (PED) on-board aircraft has apparently not focused on intentional harmful interference through mobile phones and computers, including wireless hacking of computerised flight controls.²⁵\n\n## IV. Private and Criminal Air Law\n\nDifferent to the shortcomings of civil aviation regulations in regard to cyber security, the existing legal regimes of private and criminal liability in civil aviation provide already for damage compensation, independent of the root cause and the attribution to an identifiable offender. The Warsaw Convention of 1929²⁶ and the Montreal Convention of 1999²⁷ have established a non-fault based private law liability regime for damage sustained on-board and the Rome Convention of 1952²⁸ and comparable national legislations for damage sustained on the ground. In order to provide a comprehensive protective cover for persons and property, these regimes apply also in case of criminal or terrorist attacks, whether committed by physical means or through cyber space. However, these liability regimes put a special burden on air operators and their insurers, who have to bear the risk of terror and criminal attacks against civil aviation with almost no possibility to take recourse against the perpetrators.\n\nIn the realm of criminal law, Article 1 of the Montreal Convention of 1971²⁹ is so broadly worded that it also accommodates cyber interference and attacks, when they compromise the safety of an aircraft or cause damage.³⁰ However, criminal prosecution is contingent upon the attribution of the criminal act to an identifiable offender, which poses forensic complications in the case of acts committed through cyber space.\n\n²⁵ For a critical analysis, see Kaiser, Safety and Cyber Security of Portable Electronic Devices During Flight, ZLW 2014, 250.\n²⁶ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Warsaw 1929, 13 LON 137.\n²⁷ Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, Montreal 1999, 2242 U.N.T.S. 309.\n²⁸ Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface, Rome 1952, 310 U.N.T.S. 181.\n²⁹ Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, Montreal 1971, 974 U.N.T.S. 178.\n³⁰ The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation (Beijing 2010 - ICAO Doc 9960), not yet in force, modernizes the Montreal Convention (1971) and expands the scope also to cases of aircraft being used as a weapon.\n\nZLW 64.

Under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, States Parties accept responsibility for ‘national activities in outer space’, regardless if they are performed by governmental agencies or non-governmental entities and they accept the primary responsibility for authorizing and continuously supervising such activities⁴⁵. This provision is complemented by Article 2 of the Liability Convention that establishes launching States⁴⁶ as absolutely liable towards the States that incurred damage on their territory or aircraft in flight⁴⁷.\n\nAlthough the term ‘activities in outer space’ is interpreted broadly,⁴⁸ during the treaty negotiations in the 1960s cyber activities were not considered, because the Internet did not exist and malicious cyber activities affecting completely segregated computer space systems were unheard of.

Two scenarios need to be distinguished: unauthorized cyber activities against the flight control or the payload control of a space object.\n\n## II. Flight Control\n\nInterference with the flight control of a space object can be achieved by unauthorized cyber activities, either with direct access to the space segment or through the terrestrial segment or peripheral systems. In case a malicious cyber-activity interferes with the flight control of a space object and causes catastrophic damage on the surface of the Earth to the launching State or to another State, the launching State of this space object would be deemed responsible under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and liable for the compensation of damages under the Liability Convention. The existing space law regime puts an unfair burden on the launching State, which becomes responsible for malicious cyber activities that it did not authorize, suffers the loss of its space object and also faces an obligation for third party damage compensation.⁵⁰\n\nTherefore the following solutions are proposed to adjust and to re-allocate responsibilities and liabilities when the vertiginous evolution of cyber activities results in damage through space activities as *lex ferenda*:\n\n1. States should agree on the primary responsibility to refrain from tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging⁵¹ in whatever\n\n⁴⁹ The launching State’s responsibility does however not cease after the operational life of a space object.\n\n⁵⁰ For damage to the space object of another State in outer space, the launching State would not be deemed to be liable if there is no evidence that it committed fault. Art. 3 of the Liability Convention indicates: “In the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the surface of the Earth to a space object of one launching State or to persons or property on board such a space object by a space object of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only if damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom it is responsible.” Under the general theories of international law, the launching State could take recourse against the State who is the perpetrator or tolerates such cyber activity if there is solid evidence – which is an exception.\n\n⁵¹ In the *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran Case*, Iranian students and other demonstrators occupied the US Embassy and Consulates and held hostages for several months. The Iranian authorities took no measures to impede these attacks and neither made any effort for the release of hostages. The International Court of Justice held that “[t]he policy thus announced by the Ayatollah Khomeini, of maintaining the occupation of the Embassy and the detention of its inmates as hostages [...] was complied with by other Iranian authorities and endorsed by them repeatedly in statements made in various contexts. The result of that policy was fundamentally to transform the legal nature of the situation [...].

The authorization and supervision of States under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty need to be expanded to cover cyber security of flight control. National legislation and enforcement need to set the legal parameters of States' 'continued supervision', possibly by reference to international technical recommendations, to protect space systems against unauthorized cyber activities, like ITU recommendations53 or standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)54 and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n\n3. A neutral body may help to share information on cyber threats to space systems, to collect evidence that may serve as proof of unauthorized cyber acts and also to help and support victim States in efforts to neutralize such dangers.\n\n4. Regardless of the responsibility and liability of the launching State, also such States should be responsible and (absolutely) liable for national cyber activities that lead a space segment of another State to cause damage on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft in flight. This responsibility and liability should apply for activities by governmental or non-governmental entities and encompass compensation for damages to the launching State and to third-party States that suffer damage in their territory or to their aircraft in flight.\n\nsponsible\".

Rep. 1980, para. 74.\n\n52 Of course, a State that tolerates, encourages, coordinates and/or engages in damaging cyber activities would deny attribution. Nevertheless, it is possible to make a strong case against such State with compelling evidence, see U.S. Department of Defense for the First Time Attributes Cyber Espionage to China, in: 2013 Annual Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Commission, 245, http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Annual_Report/Chapters/Chapter %202%3B%20Section%202%20China%27s%20Cyber%20Activities.pdf. \"When confronted with public accusations from the United States about its cyber espionage, Beijing attempted to refute the evidence, in part, by pointing to the anonymity of cyberspace and the lack of verifiable technical forensic data.

States who fail to comply with their supervisory obligations or by actively tolerating, encouraging, coordinating and/or engaging in cyber activities should be deemed responsible in the sense of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and be considered at fault for liability regarding loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or damage to property on board of a seized space objects and also to further damage in outer space to a third State.\n\n6. Evolving technical standards adopted and implemented by Launching States as part of their ‘continued supervision’⁵⁵ can serve as an indicator of a launching State’s due care in the context of fault-based liability under Article III of the Liability Convention.\n\n7. Launching States who have become the target of unauthorized cyber activities that affect the flight control of their space objects need to undertake all reasonable actions to prevent or halt such interference with its national space objects by using their own technical means or by requesting the assistance of other States to avert impending dangers.\n\n8. State need to inform the international community of cyber security threats that can affect space objects and may consequently lead to loss of life, personal injury or other impairment of health or loss of or property damage.\n\n## III. Payload Control\n\nUnauthorized cyber activities can also interfere with the payload of a space object by stealing, hampering or denying access to payload signals, for example communication, navigation or remote sensing information. Conversely to flight control, which has a direct effect on the physical disposition of a space object, payload signals do not fall under the responsibility regime of Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty and the liability regime under the Liability Convention. Both regimes do not apply to payload signals and their information content. For payload signals transmitted by radio or through fixed lines of terrestrial networks, the rules of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) apply instead as *lex specialis*. Notably, under Article 36 of the ITU Convention⁵⁶: “States accept no responsibility towards users of the international telecommunication services, particularly as regards claims for damages”. Even though payload functionalities do not have an effect on the physical disposition of a spacecraft, cyber security measures are needed for the protection of privacy and intellectual property of payload data and information.\n\n⁵⁵ See paragraph 2) above.\n⁵⁶ Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union (2011).\n\nZLW 64.

    "Articles\n\n## D. Conclusion\n\nAviation and space applications are vulnerable to unauthorized activities and attacks. Affected are not only the rights of privacy and intellectual property. More critically, unauthorized interference with flight controls of aircraft and spacecraft, with their navigation and air traffic management may violate the right of life, liberty, health and property. For civil aviation, as a means of mass transportation, a comprehensive regulatory framework for safety and security exists, but it must be expanded to include specific rules on cyber security. Existing safety and security rules do not suffice. From the beginning, space activities have been depending on a high degree of remote control and computerized automation, but networks have been segregated and there was only limited need for interoperability and standardization similar to aviation. Safety regulations for space activities are only at their beginning. In addition, space faring nations need to implement cyber security measures. Moreover the responsibility and liability regime for outer space activities requires some adjustments in light of evolving of unauthorized cyber activities and attacks and their attribution. Cyber security and its legal implementation will have to find its way into air and space law. It may also be possible, that the refined specialized regime of air and space law may have an imprint on the more general evolving cyber law.\n\nZLW 64. Jg. 2/2015",
