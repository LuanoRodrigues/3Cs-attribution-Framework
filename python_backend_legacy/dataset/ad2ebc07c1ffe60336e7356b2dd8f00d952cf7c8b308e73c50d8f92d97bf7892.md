Introduction\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific,³ have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union.⁴ Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU),⁵ it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge⁶ – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger.⁷ While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support.⁸ And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n¹ United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.⁹\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains.¹⁰ Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n⁹ Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n¹⁰ Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

The information environment entails three conceptual dimensions: the cognitive, virtual and physical.¹² These can in turn be subdivided in seven layers as depicted in figure 1.\nFigure 1 Information Environment and Cyberspace¹³\nFor the purpose of the chapter, the scope of cyberspace consists of three layers: (1) the physical network layer of the computers, cables and hubs, i.e. the hardware storing data and making the transfer of data possible; (2) the logical layer of data, software applications and protocols;¹⁴ and (3) the cyber persona layer which are the reflections of persons or groups and enables them to access the logical layer and hardware, and thus to interact in cyberspace (i.a. on the Internet and social media).\nWith the inception of cyberspace three new layers have been introduced for human communication, commerce but also for conflict as we have seen with the 2010 Stuxnet\nDelene, “Reinterpretation or Contestation of International Law in Cyberspace?,” *Israel Law Review* 52, no. 3 (2019): 295–326. pp. 304-305.\n¹¹ Herbert Lin and Jackie Kerr, “On Cyber-Enabled Information / Influence Warfare and Manipulation,” in *Oxford Handbook of Cybersecurity (Forthcoming)*, 2019, 1–29. pp. 11–14; Eric Jensen, “Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead,” *Texas International Law Journal* 50, no. 2 (2015): 275–304. p. 279.\n¹² Paul A.L.

Soft-cyber operations use cyberspace as a vector to 'weaponize' the content of a message but also manipulate the source (or outlet) of the message (including via falsifying social media accounts)²² to influence the cognitive dimension of other actors.²³\nContrary to traditional kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks are remotely executed operations that predominantly take place below the threshold of an armed attack as envisioned in Article 51 of the UN Charter.²⁴ For cyber-attacks it is often not the malign act (emplacing malware) that will be noticed, but the effects of it, which may develop (much) later in time.²⁵ Moreover, given the relatively low costs of entry, attacks may often stem from non-State actors that may not be under control of a State.²⁶ Since the impact of cyber-attacks, especially in soft-cyber operations, is often less tangible, it is generally viewed to be more difficult to attribute the attack to an actor.²⁷ The so-called attribution problem in\n¹⁵ Jon R.

The attribution process entails a technical,²⁹ legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty,³⁰ and an increase of strategic choices.³¹ And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.³²\nTo assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context\nThe right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood.³³ This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter,³⁴ and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy.³⁵ The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force,³⁶ and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty,³⁷ and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7)³⁸ of the Treaty on European Union\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n(TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.³⁹\nThe mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.⁴⁰\nThe *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’.⁴¹ Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal.⁴² One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack.⁴³ To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’.⁴⁴ Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely.⁴⁵ This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope⁴⁶ and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles).⁴⁷ The EU, on the other hand, includes the\nunder the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n³⁹ NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them.⁴⁹ NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution.⁵⁰ In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force.⁵¹ However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms,⁵² while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.⁵³\nInvoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity,⁵⁴ while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’.⁵⁵ The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n## 4. Collective Cyber Defence\nThe collective defence systems are challenging to apply and are never free from political consideration.

Moreover, the TEU will not overrule the obligations as laid down in the NATO treaty. Art 42.7 TEU states that “Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.”\n⁵³ When France invoked Article 42(7) in 2015 it shifted military power from out of area operations to mainland France. Other EU Member States have, in response, taken over some of those out of area tasks, which could also be valued as an act of solidarity.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system,⁵⁶ became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.⁵⁷\nCyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence.⁵⁸ Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact⁵⁹ in terms of scale and effect (c).⁶⁰ Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.⁶¹\nRecent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack),⁶² let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible,⁶³ it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude,⁶⁴ and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n56 Vladyslav Lanovoy, “The Use of Force by Non-State Actors and the Limits of Attribution of Conduct,” *European Journal of International Law* 28, no. 2 (2017): 563–85. pp. 567-568.\n57 ECFR, “Article 42.7: An Explainer.”\n58 See Boddens Hosang and Ducheine, “Implementing Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union: Legal Foundations for Mutual Defence in the Face of Modern Threats.”, pp. 14-15.\n59 Terry D.

Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors.⁶⁵ After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.⁶⁶\nThe fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force.⁶⁷ The US have, after the Nicaragua Case,⁶⁸ refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack,⁶⁹ hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures⁷⁰ excluding the use\n⁶⁵ Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n⁶⁶ Paul A.L.

While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter,⁷⁶ it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions)⁷⁷ to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities.⁷⁸ It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox.⁷⁹ Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.⁸⁰\n## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU\nIs the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law.⁸¹ The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators.",

Introduction\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific, have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union. Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU), it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger. While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support. And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains. Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

Cyberspace can be positioned in the information environment we live in. The information environment entails three conceptual dimensions: the cognitive, virtual and physical. These can in turn be subdivided in seven layers as depicted in figure 1.\nFigure 1 Information Environment and Cyberspace\nFor the purpose of the chapter, the scope of cyberspace consists of three layers: (1) the physical network layer of the computers, cables and hubs, i.e. the hardware storing data and making the transfer of data possible; (2) the logical layer of data, software applications and protocols; and (3) the cyber persona layer which are the reflections of persons or groups and enables them to access the logical layer and hardware, and thus to interact in cyberspace (i.a. on the Internet and social media).\nWith the inception of cyberspace three new layers have been introduced for human communication, commerce but also for conflict as we have seen with the 2010 Stuxnet\nDelene, “Reinterpretation or Contestation of International Law in Cyberspace?,” *Israel Law Review* 52, no. 3 (2019): 295–326. pp. 304-305.\n Herbert Lin and Jackie Kerr, “On Cyber-Enabled Information / Influence Warfare and Manipulation,” in *Oxford Handbook of Cybersecurity (Forthcoming)*, 2019, 1–29. pp. 11–14; Eric Jensen, “Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead,” *Texas International Law Journal* 50, no. 2 (2015): 275–304. p. 279.\n Paul A.L.

Hard-cyber operations are cyber-related activities in cyberspace such as hacking a computer or disabling, disrupting or destroying software or virtual persona. Hard-cyber operations affect cyberspace, while soft-cyber operations are cyber-related activities through cyberspace. Soft-cyber operations use cyberspace as a vector to 'weaponize' the content of a message but also manipulate the source (or outlet) of the message (including via falsifying social media accounts) to influence the cognitive dimension of other actors.\nContrary to traditional kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks are remotely executed operations that predominantly take place below the threshold of an armed attack as envisioned in Article 51 of the UN Charter. For cyber-attacks it is often not the malign act (emplacing malware) that will be noticed, but the effects of it, which may develop (much) later in time. Moreover, given the relatively low costs of entry, attacks may often stem from non-State actors that may not be under control of a State. Since the impact of cyber-attacks, especially in soft-cyber operations, is often less tangible, it is generally viewed to be more difficult to attribute the attack to an actor.

The attribution process entails a technical, legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty, and an increase of strategic choices. And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.\nTo assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context\nThe right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood. This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter, and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy. The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force, and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty, and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n(TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.\nThe mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.\nThe *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’. Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal. One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack. To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’. Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely. This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles). The EU, on the other hand, includes the\nunder the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

The EU solidarity clause also relates to territory but to a lesser extent, meaning that the EU could, ex Article 222 TFEU, still request assistance for disasters happening to military forces or Embassies located outside the EU.\nThe Member States of NATO and the EU are required to provide support in case the collective defence clause is invoked, but the obligatory nature of the clauses differ. While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them. NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution. In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force. However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms, while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.\nInvoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity, while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’. The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n## 4.

Other EU Member States have, in response, taken over some of those out of area tasks, which could also be valued as an act of solidarity.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system, became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.\nCyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence. Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact in terms of scale and effect (c). Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.\nRecent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack), let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible, it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude, and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nUntil such a moment, the subsequent question would therefore be if the NATO and EU collective defence systems, including the EU solidarity clause, should, based on State practice and legal opinion, be reinterpreted taking into account the attributes of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors. After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.\nThe fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force. The US have, after the Nicaragua Case, refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack, hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures excluding the use\n Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n Paul A.L.

Although the solidarity clause is confined to terrorist attack and natural or man-made disasters, the meaning of disaster is rather broad and includes ‘any situation which has or may have a severe impact on people (...)’.74 The 2013 EU Cybersecurity strategy also alluded to the possibility to invoke Article 222 TFEU in case of a serious cyber-attack.75\nFigure 2 Collective Cyber Defence &amp; EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\n\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nThe EU solidarity clause widens the options to other, more generic collective cyber security options than the inherent right of self-defence, individually or collectively, and thus not in response to an armed attack or the use of force. While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter, it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions) to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities. It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox. Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.\n## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU\nIs the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law. The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing\n For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators.",

    "# 1. Introduction": "Collective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific,³ have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union.⁴ Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU),⁵ it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge⁶ – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger.⁷ While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support.⁸ And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n¹ United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.⁹\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.",

Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context The right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood.³³ This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter,³⁴ and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy.³⁵ The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force,³⁶ and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.": "The right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty,³⁷ and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7)³⁸ of the Treaty on European Union # 3436 ex biblio/abstract vs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE (TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.³⁹ The mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.⁴⁰ The *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’.⁴¹ Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal.⁴² One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack.⁴³ To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’.⁴⁴ Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely.⁴⁵ This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope⁴⁶ and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles).⁴⁷ The EU, on the other hand, includes the under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n³⁹ NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them.⁴⁹ NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution.⁵⁰ In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force.⁵¹ However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms,⁵² while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.⁵³ Invoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity,⁵⁴ while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’.⁵⁵ The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.",
    "## 4. Collective Cyber Defence The collective defence systems are challenging to apply and are never free from political consideration. Although NATO acted in a collective and allied manner during many ⁴⁸ Perot, “The Art of Commitments: NATO, the EU, and the Interplay between Law and Politics within Europe’s Collective Defence Architecture.” p. 49.": "⁴⁹ Sari, “Mutual Assistance Clauses of the North Atlantic and EU Treaties.” p. 435.\n⁵⁰ Bakker et al., “The EU’s Mutual Assistance Clause.” p. 25; Boddens Hosang and Ducheine, “Implementing Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union: Legal Foundations for Multual Defence in the Face of Modern Threats.” p. 7.\n⁵¹ Perot, “The Art of Commitments: NATO, the EU, and the Interplay between Law and Politics within Europe’s Collective Defence Architecture.” p. 53.\n⁵² Perot. p. 51. Moreover, the TEU will not overrule the obligations as laid down in the NATO treaty. Art 42.7 TEU states that “Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.”\n⁵³ When France invoked Article 42(7) in 2015 it shifted military power from out of area operations to mainland France. Other EU Member States have, in response, taken over some of those out of area tasks, which could also be valued as an act of solidarity.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system,⁵⁶ became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.⁵⁷ Cyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence.⁵⁸ Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact⁵⁹ in terms of scale and effect (c).⁶⁰ Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.⁶¹ Recent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack),⁶² let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible,⁶³ it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude,⁶⁴ and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract vs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE Until such a moment, the subsequent question would therefore be if the NATO and EU collective defence systems, including the EU solidarity clause, should, based on State practice and legal opinion, be reinterpreted taking into account the attributes of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors.⁶⁵ After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.⁶⁶ The fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force.⁶⁷ The US have, after the Nicaragua Case,⁶⁸ refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack,⁶⁹ hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures⁷⁰ excluding the use ⁶⁵ Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n⁶⁶ Paul A.L.

Although the solidarity clause is confined to terrorist attack and natural or man-made disasters, the meaning of disaster is rather broad and includes ‘any situation which has or may have a severe impact on people (...)’.74 The 2013 EU Cybersecurity strategy also alluded to the possibility to invoke Article 222 TFEU in case of a serious cyber-attack.75\nFigure 2 Collective Cyber Defence &amp; EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\nvs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE The EU solidarity clause widens the options to other, more generic collective cyber security options than the inherent right of self-defence, individually or collectively, and thus not in response to an armed attack or the use of force. While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter,⁷⁶ it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions)⁷⁷ to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities.⁷⁸ It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox.⁷⁹ Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.⁸⁰ ## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU Is the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law.⁸¹ The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing ⁷⁶ For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n⁷⁷ Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*. Rule 20 (4).\n⁷⁹ European Union, “Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (‘Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox’),” *Draft Council Conclusions*, no. June (2017); Erica Moret and Patryk Pawlak, “The EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox: Towards a Cyber Sanctions Regime?,” *European Union Institute for Security Studies*, no. July (2017): 1–4.\n⁸⁰ Paul Ivan, “Responding to Cyberattacks: Prospects for the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox,” *European Policy Centre*, 2019. pp. 11-12.\n⁸¹ Boothby et al., “When Is a Cyberattack a Use of Force or an Armed Attack?”, p. 83.\nvs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE authorship and attributing a cyber-attack to an actor or even a State, without conclusive technical and forensic research is possible but is a political act. Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators."

Introduction\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific, have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union. Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU), it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger. While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support. And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains. Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

Cyberspace can be positioned in the information environment we live in. The information environment entails three conceptual dimensions: the cognitive, virtual and physical. These can in turn be subdivided in seven layers as depicted in figure 1.\nFigure 1 Information Environment and Cyberspace\nFor the purpose of the chapter, the scope of cyberspace consists of three layers: (1) the physical network layer of the computers, cables and hubs, i.e. the hardware storing data and making the transfer of data possible; (2) the logical layer of data, software applications and protocols; and (3) the cyber persona layer which are the reflections of persons or groups and enables them to access the logical layer and hardware, and thus to interact in cyberspace (i.a. on the Internet and social media).\nWith the inception of cyberspace three new layers have been introduced for human communication, commerce but also for conflict as we have seen with the 2010 Stuxnet\nDelene, “Reinterpretation or Contestation of International Law in Cyberspace?,” *Israel Law Review* 52, no. 3 (2019): 295–326. pp. 304-305.\n Herbert Lin and Jackie Kerr, “On Cyber-Enabled Information / Influence Warfare and Manipulation,” in *Oxford Handbook of Cybersecurity (Forthcoming)*, 2019, 1–29. pp. 11–14; Eric Jensen, “Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead,” *Texas International Law Journal* 50, no. 2 (2015): 275–304. p. 279.\n Paul A.L.

Hard-cyber operations are cyber-related activities in cyberspace such as hacking a computer or disabling, disrupting or destroying software or virtual persona. Hard-cyber operations affect cyberspace, while soft-cyber operations are cyber-related activities through cyberspace. Soft-cyber operations use cyberspace as a vector to 'weaponize' the content of a message but also manipulate the source (or outlet) of the message (including via falsifying social media accounts) to influence the cognitive dimension of other actors.\nContrary to traditional kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks are remotely executed operations that predominantly take place below the threshold of an armed attack as envisioned in Article 51 of the UN Charter. For cyber-attacks it is often not the malign act (emplacing malware) that will be noticed, but the effects of it, which may develop (much) later in time. Moreover, given the relatively low costs of entry, attacks may often stem from non-State actors that may not be under control of a State. Since the impact of cyber-attacks, especially in soft-cyber operations, is often less tangible, it is generally viewed to be more difficult to attribute the attack to an actor.

The attribution process entails a technical, legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty, and an increase of strategic choices. And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.\nTo assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context\nThe right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood. This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter, and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy. The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force, and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty, and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n(TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.\nThe mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.\nThe *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’. Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal. One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack. To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’. Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely. This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles). The EU, on the other hand, includes the\nunder the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

The EU solidarity clause also relates to territory but to a lesser extent, meaning that the EU could, ex Article 222 TFEU, still request assistance for disasters happening to military forces or Embassies located outside the EU.\nThe Member States of NATO and the EU are required to provide support in case the collective defence clause is invoked, but the obligatory nature of the clauses differ. While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them. NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution. In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force. However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms, while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.\nInvoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity, while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’. The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n## 4.

Moreover, the TEU will not overrule the obligations as laid down in the NATO treaty. Art 42.7 TEU states that “Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.”\n When France invoked Article 42(7) in 2015 it shifted military power from out of area operations to mainland France. Other EU Member States have, in response, taken over some of those out of area tasks, which could also be valued as an act of solidarity.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system, became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.\nCyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence. Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact in terms of scale and effect (c). Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.\nRecent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack), let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible, it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude, and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nUntil such a moment, the subsequent question would therefore be if the NATO and EU collective defence systems, including the EU solidarity clause, should, based on State practice and legal opinion, be reinterpreted taking into account the attributes of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors. After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.\nThe fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force. The US have, after the Nicaragua Case, refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack, hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures excluding the use\n Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n Paul A.L.

Although the solidarity clause is confined to terrorist attack and natural or man-made disasters, the meaning of disaster is rather broad and includes ‘any situation which has or may have a severe impact on people (...)’.74 The 2013 EU Cybersecurity strategy also alluded to the possibility to invoke Article 222 TFEU in case of a serious cyber-attack.75\nFigure 2 Collective Cyber Defence &amp; EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\n\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nThe EU solidarity clause widens the options to other, more generic collective cyber security options than the inherent right of self-defence, individually or collectively, and thus not in response to an armed attack or the use of force. While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter, it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions) to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities. It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox. Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.\n## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU\nIs the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law. The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing\n For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators.",

One of the technological developments is the dawn of cyberspace, a man-made domain of communication, commerce, but also of strife and conflict. A domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join without much costs and engage, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries, with all other available entities, often without exposing themselves. Moreover, most activities in cyberspace fall below the threshold of the use of force and hence outside the classic military remit. Would this imply, given the attributes of cyberspace on the one hand and of the EU on the other hand, that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nKey words: collective defence, cyberspace, Article 5, Article 42(7), mutual defence clause, solidarity clause, NATO, European Union, cyber diplomacy toolbox\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nAucune disposition de la présente Charte ne porte atteinte au droit naturel de légitime défense, individuelle ou collective, dans le cas où un Membre des Nations Unies est l'objet d'une agression armée, jusqu'à ce que le Conseil de sécurité ait pris les mesures nécessaires pour maintenir la paix et la sécurité internationales.\n\"Cyber attacks present a clear challenge to the security of the Alliance and could be as harmful to modern societies as a conventional attack.\"\n# 1. Introduction\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific, have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union. Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU), it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger. While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support. And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains. Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

Cyberspace can be positioned in the information environment we live in. The information environment entails three conceptual dimensions: the cognitive, virtual and physical. These can in turn be subdivided in seven layers as depicted in figure 1.\nFigure 1 Information Environment and Cyberspace\nFor the purpose of the chapter, the scope of cyberspace consists of three layers: (1) the physical network layer of the computers, cables and hubs, i.e. the hardware storing data and making the transfer of data possible; (2) the logical layer of data, software applications and protocols; and (3) the cyber persona layer which are the reflections of persons or groups and enables them to access the logical layer and hardware, and thus to interact in cyberspace (i.a. on the Internet and social media).\nWith the inception of cyberspace three new layers have been introduced for human communication, commerce but also for conflict as we have seen with the 2010 Stuxnet\nDelene, “Reinterpretation or Contestation of International Law in Cyberspace?,” *Israel Law Review* 52, no. 3 (2019): 295–326. pp. 304-305.\n Herbert Lin and Jackie Kerr, “On Cyber-Enabled Information / Influence Warfare and Manipulation,” in *Oxford Handbook of Cybersecurity (Forthcoming)*, 2019, 1–29. pp. 11–14; Eric Jensen, “Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead,” *Texas International Law Journal* 50, no. 2 (2015): 275–304. p. 279.\n Paul A.L.

Hard-cyber operations are cyber-related activities in cyberspace such as hacking a computer or disabling, disrupting or destroying software or virtual persona. Hard-cyber operations affect cyberspace, while soft-cyber operations are cyber-related activities through cyberspace. Soft-cyber operations use cyberspace as a vector to 'weaponize' the content of a message but also manipulate the source (or outlet) of the message (including via falsifying social media accounts) to influence the cognitive dimension of other actors.\nContrary to traditional kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks are remotely executed operations that predominantly take place below the threshold of an armed attack as envisioned in Article 51 of the UN Charter. For cyber-attacks it is often not the malign act (emplacing malware) that will be noticed, but the effects of it, which may develop (much) later in time. Moreover, given the relatively low costs of entry, attacks may often stem from non-State actors that may not be under control of a State. Since the impact of cyber-attacks, especially in soft-cyber operations, is often less tangible, it is generally viewed to be more difficult to attribute the attack to an actor.

The attribution process entails a technical, legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty, and an increase of strategic choices. And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.\nTo assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context\nThe right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood. This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter, and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy. The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force, and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty, and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7) of the Treaty on European Union\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n(TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.\nThe mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.\nThe *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’. Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal. One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack. To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’. Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely. This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles). The EU, on the other hand, includes the\nunder the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

The EU solidarity clause also relates to territory but to a lesser extent, meaning that the EU could, ex Article 222 TFEU, still request assistance for disasters happening to military forces or Embassies located outside the EU.\nThe Member States of NATO and the EU are required to provide support in case the collective defence clause is invoked, but the obligatory nature of the clauses differ. While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them. NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution. In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force. However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms, while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.\nInvoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity, while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’. The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n## 4.

Moreover, the TEU will not overrule the obligations as laid down in the NATO treaty. Art 42.7 TEU states that “Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.”\n When France invoked Article 42(7) in 2015 it shifted military power from out of area operations to mainland France. Other EU Member States have, in response, taken over some of those out of area tasks, which could also be valued as an act of solidarity.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system, became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.\nCyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence. Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact in terms of scale and effect (c). Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.\nRecent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack), let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible, it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude, and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nUntil such a moment, the subsequent question would therefore be if the NATO and EU collective defence systems, including the EU solidarity clause, should, based on State practice and legal opinion, be reinterpreted taking into account the attributes of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors. After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.\nThe fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force. The US have, after the Nicaragua Case, refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack, hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures excluding the use\n Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n Paul A.L.

Although the solidarity clause is confined to terrorist attack and natural or man-made disasters, the meaning of disaster is rather broad and includes ‘any situation which has or may have a severe impact on people (...)’.74 The 2013 EU Cybersecurity strategy also alluded to the possibility to invoke Article 222 TFEU in case of a serious cyber-attack.75\nFigure 2 Collective Cyber Defence &amp; EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\n\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\nThe EU solidarity clause widens the options to other, more generic collective cyber security options than the inherent right of self-defence, individually or collectively, and thus not in response to an armed attack or the use of force. While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter, it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions) to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities. It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox. Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.\n## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU\nIs the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law. The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing\n For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators."

Introduction\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific,³ have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union.⁴ Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU),⁵ it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge⁶ – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger.⁷ While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support.⁸ And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n¹ United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.⁹\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains.¹⁰ Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n⁹ Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n¹⁰ Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

The information environment entails three conceptual dimensions: the cognitive, virtual and physical.¹² These can in turn be subdivided in seven layers as depicted in figure 1.\nFigure 1 Information Environment and Cyberspace¹³\nFor the purpose of the chapter, the scope of cyberspace consists of three layers: (1) the physical network layer of the computers, cables and hubs, i.e. the hardware storing data and making the transfer of data possible; (2) the logical layer of data, software applications and protocols;¹⁴ and (3) the cyber persona layer which are the reflections of persons or groups and enables them to access the logical layer and hardware, and thus to interact in cyberspace (i.a. on the Internet and social media).\nWith the inception of cyberspace three new layers have been introduced for human communication, commerce but also for conflict as we have seen with the 2010 Stuxnet\nDelene, “Reinterpretation or Contestation of International Law in Cyberspace?,” *Israel Law Review* 52, no. 3 (2019): 295–326. pp. 304-305.\n¹¹ Herbert Lin and Jackie Kerr, “On Cyber-Enabled Information / Influence Warfare and Manipulation,” in *Oxford Handbook of Cybersecurity (Forthcoming)*, 2019, 1–29. pp. 11–14; Eric Jensen, “Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead,” *Texas International Law Journal* 50, no. 2 (2015): 275–304. p. 279.\n¹² Paul A.L.

Soft-cyber operations use cyberspace as a vector to 'weaponize' the content of a message but also manipulate the source (or outlet) of the message (including via falsifying social media accounts)²² to influence the cognitive dimension of other actors.²³\nContrary to traditional kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks are remotely executed operations that predominantly take place below the threshold of an armed attack as envisioned in Article 51 of the UN Charter.²⁴ For cyber-attacks it is often not the malign act (emplacing malware) that will be noticed, but the effects of it, which may develop (much) later in time.²⁵ Moreover, given the relatively low costs of entry, attacks may often stem from non-State actors that may not be under control of a State.²⁶ Since the impact of cyber-attacks, especially in soft-cyber operations, is often less tangible, it is generally viewed to be more difficult to attribute the attack to an actor.²⁷ The so-called attribution problem in\n¹⁵ Jon R.

The attribution process entails a technical,²⁹ legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty,³⁰ and an increase of strategic choices.³¹ And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.³²\nTo assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context\nThe right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood.³³ This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter,³⁴ and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy.³⁵ The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force,³⁶ and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty,³⁷ and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7)³⁸ of the Treaty on European Union\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\nPIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n(TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.³⁹\nThe mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.⁴⁰\nThe *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’.⁴¹ Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal.⁴² One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack.⁴³ To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’.⁴⁴ Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely.⁴⁵ This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope⁴⁶ and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles).⁴⁷ The EU, on the other hand, includes the\nunder the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n³⁹ NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them.⁴⁹ NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution.⁵⁰ In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force.⁵¹ However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms,⁵² while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.⁵³\nInvoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity,⁵⁴ while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’.⁵⁵ The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n## 4. Collective Cyber Defence\nThe collective defence systems are challenging to apply and are never free from political consideration.

Moreover, the TEU will not overrule the obligations as laid down in the NATO treaty. Art 42.7 TEU states that “Commitments and cooperation in this area shall be consistent with commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.”\n⁵³ When France invoked Article 42(7) in 2015 it shifted military power from out of area operations to mainland France. Other EU Member States have, in response, taken over some of those out of area tasks, which could also be valued as an act of solidarity.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system,⁵⁶ became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.⁵⁷\nCyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence.⁵⁸ Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact⁵⁹ in terms of scale and effect (c).⁶⁰ Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.⁶¹\nRecent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack),⁶² let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible,⁶³ it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude,⁶⁴ and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n56 Vladyslav Lanovoy, “The Use of Force by Non-State Actors and the Limits of Attribution of Conduct,” *European Journal of International Law* 28, no. 2 (2017): 563–85. pp. 567-568.\n57 ECFR, “Article 42.7: An Explainer.”\n58 See Boddens Hosang and Ducheine, “Implementing Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union: Legal Foundations for Mutual Defence in the Face of Modern Threats.”, pp. 14-15.\n59 Terry D.

Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors.⁶⁵ After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.⁶⁶\nThe fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force.⁶⁷ The US have, after the Nicaragua Case,⁶⁸ refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack,⁶⁹ hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures⁷⁰ excluding the use\n⁶⁵ Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n⁶⁶ Paul A.L.

Although the solidarity clause is confined to terrorist attack and natural or man-made disasters, the meaning of disaster is rather broad and includes ‘any situation which has or may have a severe impact on people (...)’.74 The 2013 EU Cybersecurity strategy also alluded to the possibility to invoke Article 222 TFEU in case of a serious cyber-attack.75\nFigure 2 Collective Cyber Defence &amp; EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\n11\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\nvs 150821\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163\n71 Article 50 (1) a of the United Nations, “Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,” Yearbook of the International Law Commission II, no.

While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter,⁷⁶ it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions)⁷⁷ to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities.⁷⁸ It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox.⁷⁹ Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.⁸⁰\n## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU\nIs the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law.⁸¹ The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators."

Introduction\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific,³ have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union.⁴ Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU),⁵ it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge⁶ – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger.⁷ While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support.⁸ And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n¹ United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.⁹\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains.¹⁰ Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n⁹ Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n¹⁰ Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

The information environment entails three conceptual dimensions: the cognitive, virtual and physical.¹² These can in turn be subdivided in seven layers as depicted in figure 1.\nFigure 1 Information Environment and Cyberspace¹³\nFor the purpose of the chapter, the scope of cyberspace consists of three layers: (1) the physical network layer of the computers, cables and hubs, i.e. the hardware storing data and making the transfer of data possible; (2) the logical layer of data, software applications and protocols;¹⁴ and (3) the cyber persona layer which are the reflections of persons or groups and enables them to access the logical layer and hardware, and thus to interact in cyberspace (i.a. on the Internet and social media).\nWith the inception of cyberspace three new layers have been introduced for human communication, commerce but also for conflict as we have seen with the 2010 Stuxnet\nDelene, “Reinterpretation or Contestation of International Law in Cyberspace?,” *Israel Law Review* 52, no. 3 (2019): 295–326. pp. 304-305.\n¹¹ Herbert Lin and Jackie Kerr, “On Cyber-Enabled Information / Influence Warfare and Manipulation,” in *Oxford Handbook of Cybersecurity (Forthcoming)*, 2019, 1–29. pp. 11–14; Eric Jensen, “Cyber Sovereignty: The Way Ahead,” *Texas International Law Journal* 50, no. 2 (2015): 275–304. p. 279.\n¹² Paul A.L.

Soft-cyber operations use cyberspace as a vector to 'weaponize' the content of a message but also manipulate the source (or outlet) of the message (including via falsifying social media accounts)²² to influence the cognitive dimension of other actors.²³ Contrary to traditional kinetic attacks, cyber-attacks are remotely executed operations that predominantly take place below the threshold of an armed attack as envisioned in Article 51 of the UN Charter.²⁴ For cyber-attacks it is often not the malign act (emplacing malware) that will be noticed, but the effects of it, which may develop (much) later in time.²⁵ Moreover, given the relatively low costs of entry, attacks may often stem from non-State actors that may not be under control of a State.²⁶ Since the impact of cyber-attacks, especially in soft-cyber operations, is often less tangible, it is generally viewed to be more difficult to attribute the attack to an actor.²⁷ The so-called attribution problem in ¹⁵ Jon R.

The attribution process entails a technical,²⁹ legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty,³⁰ and an increase of strategic choices.³¹ And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.³² To assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context The right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood.³³ This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter,³⁴ and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy.³⁵ The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force,³⁶ and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty,³⁷ and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7)³⁸ of the Treaty on European Union # 3436 ex biblio/abstract vs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE (TEU). Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.³⁹ The mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.⁴⁰ The *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’.⁴¹ Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal.⁴² One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack.⁴³ To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’.⁴⁴ Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely.⁴⁵ This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope⁴⁶ and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles).⁴⁷ The EU, on the other hand, includes the under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n³⁹ NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them.⁴⁹ NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution.⁵⁰ In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force.⁵¹ However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms,⁵² while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.⁵³ Invoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity,⁵⁴ while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’.⁵⁵ The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n## 4. Collective Cyber Defence The collective defence systems are challenging to apply and are never free from political consideration.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system,⁵⁶ became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.⁵⁷ Cyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence.⁵⁸ Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact⁵⁹ in terms of scale and effect (c).⁶⁰ Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.⁶¹ Recent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack),⁶² let alone of an armed attack. However, as crippling effects of cyber operations are feasible,⁶³ it is not unlikely that a cyber-attack might indeed reach this magnitude,⁶⁴ and potentially allow invoking current collective defence systems.\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract vs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE Until such a moment, the subsequent question would therefore be if the NATO and EU collective defence systems, including the EU solidarity clause, should, based on State practice and legal opinion, be reinterpreted taking into account the attributes of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors.⁶⁵ After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.⁶⁶ The fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force.⁶⁷ The US have, after the Nicaragua Case,⁶⁸ refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack,⁶⁹ hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures⁷⁰ excluding the use ⁶⁵ Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n⁶⁶ Paul A.L.

Although the solidarity clause is confined to terrorist attack and natural or man-made disasters, the meaning of disaster is rather broad and includes ‘any situation which has or may have a severe impact on people (...)’.74 The 2013 EU Cybersecurity strategy also alluded to the possibility to invoke Article 222 TFEU in case of a serious cyber-attack.75\nFigure 2 Collective Cyber Defence &amp; EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox\n\nvs 150821 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163 PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE The EU solidarity clause widens the options to other, more generic collective cyber security options than the inherent right of self-defence, individually or collectively, and thus not in response to an armed attack or the use of force. While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter,⁷⁶ it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions)⁷⁷ to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities.⁷⁸ It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox.⁷⁹ Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.⁸⁰ ## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU Is the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law.⁸¹ The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing ⁷⁶ For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n⁷⁷ Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators."

Introduction\n\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific,³ have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union.⁴ Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU),⁵ it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge⁶ – are available.\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger.⁷ While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support.⁸ And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n¹ United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.⁹\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n\n---\n\n## ## 4.

Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions)⁷⁷ to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities.⁷⁸ It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox.⁷⁹ Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.⁸⁰ ## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU Is the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law.⁸¹ The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing ⁷⁶ For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n⁷⁷ Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators.",

Introduction\n\nCollective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, in which the European partners rely heavily on the (nuclear) deterrence assets of the United States of America (US). The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. But several technological, political and geopolitical trends such as the US shift to the Pacific,³ have changed this relationship resulting i.a. in the enhancement of strategic autonomy of the European Union.⁴ Where the EU relied on the auxiliary collective defence system of the Western European Union (WEU),⁵ it nowadays has a clause for mutual defence similar to NATO's Article 5. \"Similar\" where NATO is confined to the military and a nascent diplomatic remit, to the EU all instruments of power – i.a. economy, information, culture, knowledge⁶ – are available.\n\nThough both organisations build on the customary international law standard regarding the right of self-defence as laid down in Article 51 of the UN Charter, the wording of the EU and NATO collective defence clauses differ. Where NATO's collective defence is a proven asset, the EU's mutual defence clause is mainly a paper tiger.⁷ While the EU does have a wide range of instruments at its disposal and appears to be forward leaning regarding cyber defence, it is but one of the (politically charged) topics on its plate. The EU mutual defence mechanism has been invoked once by France, in search for political rather than military support.⁸ And although NATO's Article 5 has also only been invoked once, it relies on a\n\n¹ United Nations, “Charter of the United Nations” (1945).

The downside for NATO is that its legacy (Cold War) thinking proves to be a burden, and the political alignment of the Alliance is no longer a given.⁹\n\nThe dawn of cyberspace is another development that impacts collective defence. Cyberspace is a man-made domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join at relatively low costs and engage with all other connected entities, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries. Actors often remain hidden behind a virtual avatar and can share data, comments and content without checking the veracity of it. Though prone to give rise to strife and even conflict, activities in cyberspace predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, hence outside the classic military remit. The problem that emerges is that cyber-attacks which are predominantly outside the remit of the use of force, and the collective defence systems (against an armed attack) appear to be mutually exclusive. Is collective cyber defence an oxymoron or should the mechanism be revisited, pursuing a broader view on collective defence? And if so, given the fact that the EU has a wide array of instruments of power at its disposal (from diplomatic measures via economic sanctions and financial fines to legal retorsions) would this then also imply that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?\n\nThis chapter aims to offer a strategic and legal perspective on the collective defence against cyber-attacks in an EU and NATO context. In order to assess whether the EU is better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO, first various types of cyber-attacks including their core attributes will be given (§ 2). Next, a comparative overview of the NATO and EU collective defence systems is offered (§ 3). In § 4 the attributes of cyber-attacks are cross-referenced with the collective defence systems to see what gaps remain. In the final section (§ 5) some concluding reflections are provided and an answer to whether or not the EU is suited to provide a collective cyber defence system.\n\n## 2. On Cyber Operations\n\nCollective defence is associated with armed attack in the traditional land-, sea or maritime domains. Cyber-attacks differ from traditional kinetic attacks in several ways. To put the differences into context a short description of cyberspace and the categories of cyber operations is given.\n\nCyberspace is a domain in which activities are executed, similar to the land, sea, space or air domains.¹⁰ Therefore, cyberspace is not an instrument or a weapon as such, but rather\n\n⁹ Sarah Raine, “Four Key Challenges for NATO in the Months Ahead,” *IISS*, January 2019.\n¹⁰ Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg, “Territorial Sovereignty and Neutrality in Cyberspace,” *U.S. Naval War College International Law Studies* 89 (2013): 123–56. p. 123; Joseph S.

The attribution process entails a technical,²⁹ legal and political layer which require a decreasing degree of certainty,³⁰ and an increase of strategic choices.³¹ And, finally, even if aggressive acts can be attributed to an actor, an attack in or via the virtual dimension of cyberspace (e.g. related to iCloud services or email-accounts) cannot always be related to a specific territory, which could have or rather impede legal implications.³²\n\nTo assess the application of collective defence against cyber-attacks, first the generic notion of collective defence is outlined.\n\n# 3. Collective Defence in an EU and NATO context\n\nThe right of States to defend themselves against an armed attack is an inherent right deriving from the very nature of Statehood.³³ This rule of customary international law is also recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter,³⁴ and guided by the principles of necessity, proportionality and immediacy.³⁵ The inherent right of self-defence relates to a response to an (imminent) armed attack, in which case the use of force is permitted, thereby exempting *jus cogens* on the prohibition of the use of force,³⁶ and Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\nThe right of self-defence can be exercised individually or collectively as depicted in NATO’s collective defence clause of Article 5 of the North-Atlantic Treaty,³⁷ and in the EU’s mutual assistance (or mutual defence) clause of Article 42(7)³⁸ of the Treaty on European Union\n\n# 3436 ex biblio/abstract\n\nvs 150821\n\nElectronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3962163",

Aside from an assistance clause, the Member States of the EU can also invoke a solidarity clause (Article 222 Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU)) in case of terrorist attacks or natural and man-made disasters.³⁹\n\nThe mutual defence clauses of the EU and NATO both refer to Article 51 of the UN Charter and are similar in intent, though differing in substance. Taking also the EU solidarity clause into account, the differences relate to the activation criterion, the territorial scope and binding nature of the clause, and the implementing set-up.⁴⁰\n\nThe *casus foederis* or the trigger for invoking NATO’s Article 5 is an ‘armed attack’ echoing the words of Article 51 of the UN Charter. The mutual assistance clause of the EU uses ‘armed aggression’.⁴¹ Despite linguistic differences, the factual differences are marginal.⁴² One explanation for the differences is that “armed aggression” was translated literally from the French version of Article 51 UN Charter, which refers to ‘agression armée’ instead of armed attack.⁴³ To Sari, this is the narrow interpretation of the activation criterion, equating armed aggression to armed attack, while a broader interpretation would give room for providing assistance in case unlawful force is used ‘that does not reach the gravity threshold of an armed attack’.⁴⁴ Sari argues that it is not likely that the drafters intended to broaden the notion of armed attack, but the possibility must not be discarded completely.⁴⁵ This rationale can be supported by arguing that the EU intended to apply alternative collective security mechanisms, by offering the option of assistance based on solidarity in cases other than an armed attack via Article 222 TFEU.\n\nBoth NATO and EU mutual defence clauses have a territorial scope⁴⁶ and refer to attacks on the territory of the Member States. NATO includes extraterritorial military assets within the region demarcated by Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty, but excludes overseas territories (e.g. Dutch or French Antilles).⁴⁷ The EU, on the other hand, includes the\n\nunder the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which, for those States which are members of it, remains the foundation of their collective defence and the forum for its implementation.” Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union, C–326 Official Journal of the European Union (2012).\n\n³⁹ NATO could refer to Article 4 when ‘territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened’.

While Article 42(7) TEU uses stronger language, it cannot address all Member States equally due to the neutrality of some of them.⁴⁹ NATO does not require the Member States to provide aid and assistance ‘by all the means in their power’ as Article 42(7) requests, but asks for such action as the Member States deem necessary. A bigger difference, however, concerns the ‘what’ of the contribution.⁵⁰ In both the EU and NATO, Member States can use all instruments of power to respond, including - but not limited to - the use of force.⁵¹ However, the contribution of NATO Member States is, or can, be substantial in military terms,⁵² while the EU contribution might not surpass political and diplomatic support.⁵³\n\nInvoking Article 222 TFEU in case of a terrorist attack or a disaster, will result in an EU-led and embedded activity,⁵⁴ while Article 42(7) TEU or Article 5 of the NATO Treaty ‘entail direct state-to-state assistance without explicitly mentioning any role for the common EU or NATO institutions as such’.⁵⁵ The reason for this is that Articles 42(7) TEU and Article 5 NATO Treaty derive from the inherent right of self-defence, while Article 222 TFEU does not.\n\n## 4.

Kinetic operations, and the subsequent use of the collective defence system,⁵⁶ became even more complex with the rise of terrorism. The attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001, by a non-State actor paradoxically triggered the invocation of Article 5 for the first time. The terrorist attacks in Paris (i.a. Bataclan) on 13 November 2015, urging France to invoke Article 42(7), were also executed by non-State actors.⁵⁷\n\nCyber-attacks, making use of the virtual dimension, might prove to be even more challenging to align with the system of collective defence.⁵⁸ Not only are non-State actors active in cyberspace, but moreover, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force. Two questions must therefore be addressed: can cyber-attacks amount to the level of an armed attack, and if not, the subsequent question is whether the collective defence system is applicable to attacks below the threshold of the use of force?\n\nArmed attacks comprise transnational (a) use of force (b), which will have a substantial impact⁵⁹ in terms of scale and effect (c).⁶⁰ Cyber-attacks could amount to the level of an armed attack, if they cause effects ‘resulting in physical casualties, substantial physical damage, or such substantial and long-term damage to critical infrastructure that the carrying out of a State’s essential functions or its social and political stability are seriously impaired’.⁶¹\n\nRecent cyber-attacks have not amounted to the level of use of force (with the possible exception of the 2010 Stuxnet attack),⁶² let alone of an armed attack.

    "PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n\nUntil such a moment, the subsequent question would therefore be if the NATO and EU collective defence systems, including the EU solidarity clause, should, based on State practice and legal opinion, be reinterpreted taking into account the attributes of cyber-attacks. Cyber operations are often executed by (elusive) non-State actors, the activities predominantly falling below an armed attack, and even below the use of force.\n\nThe issue of non-State actors is less problematic. Although Article 51 of the UN Charter (and therefore the derivative Article 5 of the NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU) has been incorporated in treaties regulating State behaviour, this does not impair the inherent or customary international rule of self-defence, also against non-State actors.⁶⁵ After 9/11, this now also appears a common interpretation of Article 51 UN Charter itself.⁶⁶\n\nThe fact that the customary international right of self-defence also applies to armed attacks by non-State actors does not, however, solve the collective cyber defence conundrum. The difficulty lies in the combination of a non-State cyber-attack below the threshold of an armed attack, that cannot be attributed to a specific perpetrator, or (territorially) located.\n\nThe customary international right on self-defence and hence Article 51 UN Charter, Article 5 NATO Treaty and Article 42(7) TEU, are earmarked for responding to armed attacks. The remit could be widened to include ‘armed aggression’ or even the use of force.⁶⁷ The US have, after the Nicaragua Case,⁶⁸ refrained from distinguishing between the use of force and an armed attack,⁶⁹ hence, in their view, any form of the use of force can invoke the right of self-defence. However, this legal opinion is not universally held. Using ‘armed aggression’ instead of ‘armed attack’ could, liberally reading into the intention of the EU drafters, also stretch the remit of collective defence to include responses to use of force. However, both interpretations will not suffice since cyber-attack could not only fall below the level of armed attack but also below the level of the use of force. Furthermore, from a legal point of view, stretching this standard would be untenable since an armed attack invokes the inherent right of self-defence, while (other) use of force in an interstate setting does not, although it may authorise such responses as countermeasures⁷⁰ excluding the use\n\n⁶⁵ Gill and Tibori-Szabó, Twelve Key Questions on Self-Defense against Non-State Actors – and Some Answers. p. 474.\n⁶⁶ Paul A.L.

    "PIJPERS, BODDENS HOSANG &amp; DUCHEINE – COLLECTIVE CYBER DEFENCE\n\nThe EU solidarity clause widens the options to other, more generic collective cyber security options than the inherent right of self-defence, individually or collectively, and thus not in response to an armed attack or the use of force. While NATO is able to issue statements regarding unwelcome situations in its territorial perimeter,⁷⁶ it basically lacks instruments of power in the remit below the use of force. This should not be surprising, since this is not NATO’s purpose. The opposite applies to the EU. Although the EU has some arrangements regarding responses to an armed attack, the core of its instruments – aligned with the purpose of the EU – are not related to the use of force. The EU has numerous tools within these instruments of power ranging from restrictive measures (sanctions)⁷⁷ to recalling diplomats and issuing demarches. In legal terms the responsive measure amounts to retorsions: unfriendly albeit lawful activities.⁷⁸ It is also in this area (see figure 2) where most cyber-attacks take place. Related to malign activities in cyberspace, the EU has a joint response mechanism in which Union and Member States’ tools are collected in the so-called cyber diplomacy toolbox.⁷⁹ Although this toolbox is not a coherent foreign policy instrument but rather a potpourri of options, it is illustrative for a potency of a collective cyber defence mechanism against cyber-attacks below the use of force.⁸⁰\n\n## 5. Reflections on the Role of the EU\n\nIs the EU better equipped to provide a collective defence system against cyber-attacks than NATO?\n\nIt can be assessed that, firstly, cyber-attacks predominantly fall below the threshold of the use of force, which implies that collective defence clauses meant for armed attacks are incompatible with most cyber-attacks. Secondly, cyber-attacks are often executed by non-State actors. Although Article 51 UN Charter was meant to regulate State behaviour, the inherent right of self-defence it reflects is a separate rule of customary international law.⁸¹ The latter includes attacks by non-State actors, and after the 9/11 attack Article 51 UN Charter is also commonly read in that sense. Thirdly, the author and the origin of cyber-attacks (State or non-State actors) are sometimes difficult to pinpoint, referring to the time-laps between the malign cyber-activity and the actual effect of a cyber-attack. Establishing\n\n⁷⁶ For example: NATO, “North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia,” 2021, 5–6.\n\n⁷⁷ Title IV, Article 215 on Restrictive Measures of the “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,” *Official Journal of the European Union* C 326 (2012).\n\n⁷⁸ Schmitt, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations*.

Nevertheless, and although with lower (overt) standards of certainty, attribution is nevertheless on the rise. Fourthly, cyber-attacks aim to affect the cognitive dimension via cyberspace. Often these attacks do not have a physical or functional manifestation, making it challenging to conclude that the territory of an EU or NATO Member State is affected.\n\nThe EU, as an integrated and political entity, has a broader scope than NATO which can be used to tackle many issues related to cyber-attacks. The EU competences coalesce with the attributes of current cyber-attacks, especially when related to problems of attribution, the virtual characteristics of the cyber-attack, but primarily given the fact that cyber-attacks remain below the use of force.\n\nIn that sense, the EU is better suited to respond to cyber-attacks. The EU is able to focus on collective measures below the use of force including diplomatic, economic and other instruments, thereby complementing NATO and not latently competing with it.\n\nHowever, while the current cyber diplomacy toolbox is a welcome first step, it is insufficient as a coherent EU joint response mechanism as it lacks focus. To strengthen the EU policy related to a joint response to cyber-attacks, the EU response mechanism would need to operate separately from collective responses to armed attacks since the latter are based on the inherent right of self-defence of Member States – individually or collectively. It should also operate separately from responses by single Member States, which include countermeasures against the use of force. Since collective countermeasures by the EU are not allowed, the EU's joint response mechanism against cyber-attacks should revolve around lawful though unwelcome proportional repercussions and retorsions, including collective EU sanctions and issuance of diplomatic statements attributing cyber-attacks to alleged perpetrators.\n\n# Bibliography\n\nBakker, Anne, Sven Biscop, Margriet Drent, and Lennert Landman. “The EU’s Mutual Assistance Clause.” In *Spearheading European Defence*, edited by Clingendael Institute, 2016.\n\nBetz, David J., and Tim Stevens. “Power and Cyberspace.” *Adelphi Series* 51, no. 424 (2011): 35–54.\n\nBoddens Hosang, J.F.R. *Rules of Engagement and the International Law of Military Operations.

    "abstract": "Collective defence is the cornerstone of the North-Atlantic defence system, NATO, in which the European partners rely heavily on the deterrence assets of the United States of America. The solidarity in this system has been one-sided. Due to technological, political and geopolitical developments, this relationship changed, enhancing or rather necessitating a stronger strategic autonomy of the European Union. Similar to NATO's Article 5, the EU also has a clause for mutual defence; \"similar\" since where NATO is confined to the diplomatic but primarily military remit, the EU has all instruments of power (i.a. economic) at its disposal. One of the technological developments is the dawn of cyberspace, a man-made domain of communication, commerce, but also of strife and conflict. A domain where new actors – State or non-State – can join without much costs and engage, irrespective of hierarchy or boundaries, with all other available entities, often without exposing themselves. Moreover, most activities in cyberspace fall below the threshold of the use of force and hence outside the classic military remit. Would this imply, given the attributes of cyberspace on the one hand and of the EU on the other hand, that the EU is better equipped to provide a security umbrella against modern cyber threats?
