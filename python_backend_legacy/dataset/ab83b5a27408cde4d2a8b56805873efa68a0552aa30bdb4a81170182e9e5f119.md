Even though it is possible that the EU's sanctions regime might target 'lone cyber wolves' – individual hackers acting without any guidance or with no connection to a state – the experience to date shows that in most known cases there is a link between a perpetrator and a state. Therefore, the following sections discuss the challenges of attribution and state responsibility primarily through the prism of international law.¹\n# SHADES OF ATTRIBUTION\nImposing a sanction equals assigning responsibility for a cyber activity or for failing to prevent such an activity from occurring. Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity. Even when attribution is possible, a state may prefer not to publicly attribute the\n**Capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response.**\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n¹ For the discussion of other dimensions of attribution in cyberspace, see for instance: Sven Herpig and Thomas Reinhold, “Spotting the Bear: Credible Attribution and Russian Operations in Cyberspace”, in Nicu Popescu and Stanislav Secrieru (eds.), “Hacks, Leaks and Disruptions: Russian Cyber Strategies”, EUISS Chaillot Paper no 148, October 2018.\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\ncyber operation due to other considerations, such as the geopolitical context and the need for confidentiality with regard to intelligence sources and techniques. As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility,² the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.³\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state⁴ or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state.⁵ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct.⁶ While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n² See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n³ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n⁴ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n⁵ Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n⁶ Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n# Cyber diplomacy tools\nand the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification. In reality, each action needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis and be preceded by a detailed legal analysis.\nData: EUISS, 2017\nthey are its organs, such operations conducted by a company owned by a state might be considered insufficient grounds for attribution. Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n57\nexample of such an initiative. However, some of the joint response mechanisms – and the sanctions regime in particular – rely heavily on the capacity to establish a link between an attack and a perpetrator. Given that attribution remains a sovereign right of each member state and that each country works with its own intelligence and analysis – in addition to the assessments and analysis provided by EU bodies such as CERT-EU and INTCEN – arriving at a collective understanding might be difficult. The EU member states have very diverse approaches towards (public) attribution of cyber operations, which may complicate the future implementation of this framework. France still refrains from attributing cyber operations publicly, while others, notably the UK and the Netherlands, have decided to take part in joint attribution with non-EU states.\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION\nThe attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in\n9 See: Pierre-Emmanuel Dupont, “Countermeasures and Collective Security: The Case of the EU Sanctions Against Iran”, Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law, vol. 17, no. 3 (2012): pp. 301–36.\n10 It should be noted, however, that some states and scholars advocate the existence of a right of collective countermeasures pursuant the law of state responsibility. See, for instance: President of Estonia, “President of the Republic at the Opening of CyCon 2019”, May 2019, https://president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/15241-president-of-the-republic-at-the-opening-of-cycon-2019/\n11 It is important to note at this stage, however, that the thematic sanctions adopted by the UN as part of its sanctions regime or under the EU’s autonomous sanction regimes target specific violations of international law or are adopted in response to persistent violations of international law such as the human rights conventions or the UN Security Council resolutions. Sanctions in such cases are political instruments tantamount to countermeasures that do not require any specific evidence to be presented.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nBangladesh, and WannaCry.¹² The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions.¹³ The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok.¹⁴ Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him.¹⁵ Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool\nThe potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective\nCharging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from\nthe protection of another state (usually the one\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n59\nlinked through the attribution and where those nationals reside). In sum, charging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report¹⁶ and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain.¹⁷ The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences.¹⁸ The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.¹⁹\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n16 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), “Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security,” UN Doc A/70/174, para 28(f).

For instance,\nthe collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\nthe risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n# CONCLUSIONS\nThe issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity. Even when attribution is possible, a state may prefer not to publicly attribute the\n**Capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response.**\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n For the discussion of other dimensions of attribution in cyberspace, see for instance: Sven Herpig and Thomas Reinhold, “Spotting the Bear: Credible Attribution and Russian Operations in Cyberspace”, in Nicu Popescu and Stanislav Secrieru (eds.), “Hacks, Leaks and Disruptions: Russian Cyber Strategies”, EUISS Chaillot Paper no 148, October 2018.\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\ncyber operation due to other considerations, such as the geopolitical context and the need for confidentiality with regard to intelligence sources and techniques. As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility, the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state. In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct. While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n# Cyber diplomacy tools\nand the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification. In reality, each action needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis and be preceded by a detailed legal analysis.\nData: EUISS, 2017\nthey are its organs, such operations conducted by a company owned by a state might be considered insufficient grounds for attribution. Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION\nThe attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nBangladesh, and WannaCry. The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions. The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok. Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him. Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool\nThe potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective\nCharging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from\nthe protection of another state (usually the one\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain. The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences. The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nData: FireEye, 2019; Crowdstrike, 2019\nwell-established operating procedures in place to collect and handle evidence, there are numerous reasons why states are reluctant to disclose such information to a broader public or even use it in court proceedings. For instance,\nthe collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\nthe risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n# CONCLUSIONS\nThe issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

    "# SHADES OF ATTRIBUTION": "Imposing a sanction equals assigning responsibility for a cyber activity or for failing to prevent such an activity from occurring. Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity. Even when attribution is possible, a state may prefer not to publicly attribute the\n**Capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response.**\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n¹ For the discussion of other dimensions of attribution in cyberspace, see for instance: Sven Herpig and Thomas Reinhold, “Spotting the Bear: Credible Attribution and Russian Operations in Cyberspace”, in Nicu Popescu and Stanislav Secrieru (eds.), “Hacks, Leaks and Disruptions: Russian Cyber Strategies”, EUISS Chaillot Paper no 148, October 2018.\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\ncyber operation due to other considerations, such as the geopolitical context and the need for confidentiality with regard to intelligence sources and techniques. As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.",
    "# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY": "The state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility,² the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.³\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state⁴ or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state.⁵ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct.⁶ While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n² See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n³ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n⁴ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n⁵ Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n⁶ Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards",
    "# Cyber diplomacy tools": "and the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification. In reality, each action needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis and be preceded by a detailed legal analysis.\nData: EUISS, 2017\nthey are its organs, such operations conducted by a company owned by a state might be considered insufficient grounds for attribution. Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace",
    "# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION": "Over the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.",
    "# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE": "The development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.",
    "# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION The attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Guardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace Bangladesh, and WannaCry.¹² The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions.¹³ The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok.¹⁴ Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him.¹⁵ Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.": "The US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool The potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective Charging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from the protection of another state (usually the one This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms CHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards",
    "# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS": "The above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report¹⁶ and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain.¹⁷ The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences.¹⁸ The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.¹⁹\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Guardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace Data: FireEye, 2019; Crowdstrike, 2019 well-established operating procedures in place to collect and handle evidence, there are numerous reasons why states are reluctant to disclose such information to a broader public or even use it in court proceedings. For instance, the collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms CHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards the risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.",
    "# CONCLUSIONS The issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.": "But the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

In the same way that cosmic dust used to annoy astronomers as it obscured objects they wished to observe, the question of attribution is sometimes dismissed as receiving too much attention in the discussion about imposing consequences on malicious actors in cyberspace. Different policy communities have taken different approaches to how central attribution and evidentiary standards are for an effective cyber sanctions regime, ranging from the dismissive ('Do you need to see Putin on your keyboard?') to the conservative ('How do you want to win the court case?'). Therefore, while some\nAttribution has become a central element in the discussion about consequences and ending impunity in cyberspace.\nconsider it solely a hindrance that complicates the process of imposing consequences and ensuring adherence to international law and norms of responsible state behaviour, others see it as a significant and vital component that can reveal basic information about the tension between politics, justice and the rule of law in cyberspace.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explain some of the main dilemmas linked to the challenge of attribution, in particular regarding the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to states. Even though currently the EU's sanctions regime does not target states but only individuals and entities, it is generally acknowledged that most of the attacks with significant effect require some level of support from a state.

Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity.

As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility, the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state. In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct. While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n# Cyber diplomacy tools\nand the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification.

Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION\nThe attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nBangladesh, and WannaCry. The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions. The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok. Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him. Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool\nThe potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective\nCharging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from\nthe protection of another state (usually the one\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain. The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences. The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nData: FireEye, 2019; Crowdstrike, 2019\nwell-established operating procedures in place to collect and handle evidence, there are numerous reasons why states are reluctant to disclose such information to a broader public or even use it in court proceedings. For instance,\nthe collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\nthe risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n# CONCLUSIONS\nThe issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Even though currently the EU's sanctions regime does not target states but only individuals and entities, it is generally acknowledged that most of the attacks with significant effect require some level of support from a state.

Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity. Even when attribution is possible, a state may prefer not to publicly attribute the\n**Capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response.**\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n For the discussion of other dimensions of attribution in cyberspace, see for instance: Sven Herpig and Thomas Reinhold, “Spotting the Bear: Credible Attribution and Russian Operations in Cyberspace”, in Nicu Popescu and Stanislav Secrieru (eds.), “Hacks, Leaks and Disruptions: Russian Cyber Strategies”, EUISS Chaillot Paper no 148, October 2018.\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\ncyber operation due to other considerations, such as the geopolitical context and the need for confidentiality with regard to intelligence sources and techniques. As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility, the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state. In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct. While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n# Cyber diplomacy tools\nand the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification.

Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION\nThe attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nBangladesh, and WannaCry. The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions. The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok. Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him. Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool\nThe potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective\nCharging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from\nthe protection of another state (usually the one\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain. The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences. The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nData: FireEye, 2019; Crowdstrike, 2019\nwell-established operating procedures in place to collect and handle evidence, there are numerous reasons why states are reluctant to disclose such information to a broader public or even use it in court proceedings. For instance,\nthe collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\nthe risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n# CONCLUSIONS\nThe issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Even though it is possible that the EU's sanctions regime might target 'lone cyber wolves' – individual hackers acting without any guidance or with no connection to a state – the experience to date shows that in most known cases there is a link between a perpetrator and a state. Therefore, the following sections discuss the challenges of attribution and state responsibility primarily through the prism of international law.¹\n# SHADES OF ATTRIBUTION\nImposing a sanction equals assigning responsibility for a cyber activity or for failing to prevent such an activity from occurring. Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity.

As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility,² the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.³\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state⁴ or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state.⁵ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct.⁶ While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n² See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n³ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n⁴ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n⁵ Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n⁶ Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n# Cyber diplomacy tools\nand the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification. In reality, each action needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis and be preceded by a detailed legal analysis.\nData: EUISS, 2017\nthey are its organs, such operations conducted by a company owned by a state might be considered insufficient grounds for attribution. Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n57\nexample of such an initiative. However, some of the joint response mechanisms – and the sanctions regime in particular – rely heavily on the capacity to establish a link between an attack and a perpetrator. Given that attribution remains a sovereign right of each member state and that each country works with its own intelligence and analysis – in addition to the assessments and analysis provided by EU bodies such as CERT-EU and INTCEN – arriving at a collective understanding might be difficult. The EU member states have very diverse approaches towards (public) attribution of cyber operations, which may complicate the future implementation of this framework. France still refrains from attributing cyber operations publicly, while others, notably the UK and the Netherlands, have decided to take part in joint attribution with non-EU states.\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION\nThe attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in\n9 See: Pierre-Emmanuel Dupont, “Countermeasures and Collective Security: The Case of the EU Sanctions Against Iran”, Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law, vol. 17, no. 3 (2012): pp. 301–36.\n10 It should be noted, however, that some states and scholars advocate the existence of a right of collective countermeasures pursuant the law of state responsibility. See, for instance: President of Estonia, “President of the Republic at the Opening of CyCon 2019”, May 2019, https://president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/15241-president-of-the-republic-at-the-opening-of-cycon-2019/\n11 It is important to note at this stage, however, that the thematic sanctions adopted by the UN as part of its sanctions regime or under the EU’s autonomous sanction regimes target specific violations of international law or are adopted in response to persistent violations of international law such as the human rights conventions or the UN Security Council resolutions. Sanctions in such cases are political instruments tantamount to countermeasures that do not require any specific evidence to be presented.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\nBangladesh, and WannaCry.¹² The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions.¹³ The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok.¹⁴ Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him.¹⁵ Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool\nThe potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective\nCharging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from\nthe protection of another state (usually the one\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n59\nlinked through the attribution and where those nationals reside). In sum, charging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report¹⁶ and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain.¹⁷ The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences.¹⁸ The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.¹⁹\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n16 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), “Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security,” UN Doc A/70/174, para 28(f).

For instance,\nthe collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\nthe risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n# CONCLUSIONS\nThe issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

This is generally referred to as the challenge of attribution. With the member states retaining the primary responsibility for decisions about attribution, the role of the EU institutions in this domain and the question of shared situational awareness and political judgment will play a key role in how the EU cyber sanctions regime is implemented.\n# Constellation of issues in this chapter Formally distinct from the concept of listing (i.e. the formal legal process of placing an individual or an entity on a sanctions list), attribution has become a central element in the discussion about consequences and ending impunity in cyberspace. In the same way that cosmic dust used to annoy astronomers as it obscured objects they wished to observe, the question of attribution is sometimes dismissed as receiving too much attention in the discussion about imposing consequences on malicious actors in cyberspace. Different policy communities have taken different approaches to how central attribution and evidentiary standards are for an effective cyber sanctions regime, ranging from the dismissive ('Do you need to see Putin on your keyboard?') to the conservative ('How do you want to win the court case?'). Therefore, while some Attribution has become a central element in the discussion about consequences and ending impunity in cyberspace.\nconsider it solely a hindrance that complicates the process of imposing consequences and ensuring adherence to international law and norms of responsible state behaviour, others see it as a significant and vital component that can reveal basic information about the tension between politics, justice and the rule of law in cyberspace.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explain some of the main dilemmas linked to the challenge of attribution, in particular regarding the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to states. Even though currently the EU's sanctions regime does not target states but only individuals and entities, it is generally acknowledged that most of the attacks with significant effect require some level of support from a state.

Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution. Public attribution refers to the decision to publicly name a state or another actor believed to be behind a specific cyber activity.

As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility,² the state bears responsibility for an act if\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.³\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state⁴ or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state.⁵ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct.⁶ While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n² See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n³ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n⁴ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n⁵ Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n⁶ Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n# Cyber diplomacy tools\nand the certainty of attribution\nDisclaimer: The categories proposed in this figure are a simplification. In reality, each action needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis and be preceded by a detailed legal analysis.\nData: EUISS, 2017\nthey are its organs, such operations conducted by a company owned by a state might be considered insufficient grounds for attribution. Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology. At the same time, we should also be wary of lowering the threshold too significantly. Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nGuardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nCHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION The attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Guardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace Bangladesh, and WannaCry.¹² The complaint alleges that he was a member of a government-sponsored hacking team known as the ‘Lazarus Group’, and worked for the North Korean government front company, Chosun Expo Joint Venture, to support the DPRK government’s malicious cyber actions.¹³ The same day, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced new sanctions against ‘one entity and one individual tied to the Government of North Korea’s malign cyber activities,’ the concerned entity and individual being respectively Chosun Expo Joint Venture and Park Jin Hyok.¹⁴ Park Jin Hyok is believed to be in North Korea and the FBI has issued a search warrant for him.¹⁵ Yet, there is little chance that Park Jin Hyok will travel to the United States or to any country which would extradite him to the United States. This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool The potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law. In addition, approaching the problem of attribution from the international law perspective Charging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\ndoes not always provide clarity on which norms or provisions of international law have been violated. At the same time, the judicialisation of attribution also bolsters the sanctions policy of the state. The sanctions are not adopted against a state allegedly responsible for a cyber operation, but against the individuals and entities that have been identified by the authorities as perpetrators of malicious cyber activities and who benefit from the protection of another state (usually the one This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms CHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report¹⁶ and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain.¹⁷ The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences.¹⁸ The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.¹⁹\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Guardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace Data: FireEye, 2019; Crowdstrike, 2019 well-established operating procedures in place to collect and handle evidence, there are numerous reasons why states are reluctant to disclose such information to a broader public or even use it in court proceedings. For instance, the collected evidence and intelligence might contain information that would reveal capabilities, techniques and methods that a state in question possesses. By publicly disclosing information about a cyber operation, a state takes This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms CHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards the risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n# CONCLUSIONS The issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

Even though it is possible that the EU's sanctions regime might target 'lone cyber wolves' – individual hackers acting without any guidance or with no connection to a state – the experience to date shows that in most known cases there is a link between a perpetrator and a state. Therefore, the following sections discuss the challenges of attribution and state responsibility primarily through the prism of international law.¹\n\n# SHADES OF ATTRIBUTION\n\nImposing a sanction equals assigning responsibility for a cyber activity or for failing to prevent such an activity from occurring. Attribution refers to the process of assigning the responsibility for an act or conduct to a perpetrator. Attribution is the first question that needs to be answered in order to establish the right course of action dictated by international law (in the case of state responsibility) or domestic laws (in the case of individuals and entities). However, capacity to attribute responsibility for a malicious cyber incident is a precondition for an effective response. One of the existing challenges in the implementation of a sanctions regime, as mentioned in previous chapters, is the difficulty in clearly establishing links between states and the perpetrators of cyber operations: state proxies (i.e. individuals and state agents whose conduct is attributable to states) or other subjects of international law. For this reason\n\nthe Council Decision and Regulation provide a broad set of criteria for listing an individual or entity. But Council Decision 2019/797 also makes it abundantly clear that targeted sanctions should be differentiated from the attribution of responsibility for cyberattacks to a third state and that 'the application of targeted sanctions does not amount to such attribution, which is a sovereign political decision taken by individual states on a case-by-case basis'.\n\nAttributing a cyber operation implies three different dimensions: identification of the computers and networks that were used for the launch and conduct of the operation; linking the operation to its human perpetrators; and the potential imputation of a wrongdoing to a state, if the perpetrator acted on behalf of that state. Each of these three dimensions is distinct and independent, and it is sometimes possible to identify the responsible state even without any knowledge of the computer used to carry out the attack or the individuals involved. This would be the case, for instance, when a state is able to attribute the cyber operation because its intelligence services intercepted communications on the perpetration of the cyber operation from the responsible state.\n\nIn recent years we have seen an increasing number of cases of public attribution whereby individual states have decided to point a finger in a specific direction. This has been, for instance, the case of North Korea and Russia whose links to the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks respectively have been documented and presented to the public. However, it is important to dissociate public attribution from the other dimensions of attribution.

As well as being political, the process of public attribution has legal, forensic and technical dimensions. Attribution to a machine from which the cyber operation was prepared, launched or transited, or a person, is mainly based on technical and forensic methods, while attribution to a state is mainly a political decision based to some extent on international law and factual evidence. It is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n\n# ATTRIBUTION IN THE LAW OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe state is an abstract entity but it is not a black box. States operate through their agents: individuals or entities acting under the authority of a state to which actions are attributed. States may also operate through individuals and entities who are not in a hierarchical relationship to the organs of the state or who are linked informally to state institutions. The attribution of conduct to a state is an important question in international law.\n\nIn the context of the law of state responsibility,² the state bears responsibility for an act if\n\nIt is clear that international law cannot resolve the technical problem of attribution.\n\nthree criteria are fulfilled: (i) the act is attributed to the state; (ii) the conduct constitutes an internationally wrongful act; and (iii) there are no circumstances precluding wrongfulness of the act. Alternatively, in some cases, even if a cyber operation is not attributed to a state, that state may be still held responsible according to the principle of due diligence. It is the question of establishing the link between the state and the wrongful act that is key for the discussion about potential sanctions. It is undisputed that the rules on state responsibility governing attribution apply to cyber conduct insofar as international law applies to states' activities in cyberspace. Cyber operations conducted by state organs, entities empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority or organs placed at the disposal of a state are attributable to the state, even when they are ultra vires.³\n\nHowever, private individuals, acting alone or in groups, are increasingly involved in state activities. In line with the jurisprudence of the ICJ and the Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that the acts are conducted from the territory of a state⁴ or conducted by citizens of a state is not sufficient reason to attribute these acts to that state.⁵ In certain circumstances, however, the conduct of individuals is attributable to the state, notably if they act under the instructions, direction or control of the state, if they use public power in the absence or default of the state, and finally if the state endorses a posteriori their conduct.⁶ While operations conducted by the military, intelligence or cybersecurity agencies of a state would meet the criterion of state responsibility insomuch as\n\n² See generally: François Delerue, “International Law in Cyberspace Matters : This Is How and Why”, Ideas in Focus, EU Cyber Direct, May 16, 2019, https://eucyberdirect.eu/content_research/international-law-in-cyberspace-matters-this-is-how-and-why/\n\n³ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol I)/Corr4), Articles 4-7.\n\n⁴ International Court of Justice (ICJ), Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) ICJ Reports, 1949, para. 4-18.\n\n⁵ Olivier De Frouville, “Attribution of Conduct to the State: Private Individuals”, in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 261-64.\n\n⁶ Articles on Responsibility of States, op. cit., Articles 8-11.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

Similarly, a state would carry responsibility for actions of a non-state actor engaged in disruptive operations targeting financial or election infrastructure under that state's directions.\n\nIn some cases, the degree of control required for the attribution of an act perpetrated by a non-state actor under the instructions, direction or control of the state might amount to an excessively high threshold to be applicable and relevant to the use of new technology.

Reflection is thus needed in order to define the most\n\nappropriate threshold to cater for attribution in cases of cyber operations. There are two main reasons underlying this situation: the internet offers the easiest way to coordinate activity without the need for any formal structures and cyber operations offer an easy means to act and to incentivise others to act. For instance, 'arming and training' means the physical delivery of weapons and the sending of agents to train the individuals on how to use these weapons. In cyberspace, the same objective can be achieved with more ease: but establishing the responsibility of, for instance, a state delivering a vulnerability to a non-state actor with the intent to perform a cyberattack may not be that straightforward.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "Guardian of the Galaxy | EU cyber sanctions and norms in cyberspace\n\n# STATE PRACTICE ON ATTRIBUTION\n\nOver the last decade, a growing number of states have publicly attributed cyber operations to other states. Attribution is the sovereign decision of each state and therefore most of them are made through unilateral declarations. However, cases of joint or collective attribution have increased over time. Several states have almost simultaneously attributed WannaCry and Not-Petya to North Korea and Russia respectively. On 4 October 2018, the UK and the Netherlands presented the first joint attribution relative to cyber operations, via a statement by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, attributing several operations to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU. These included attempts to undermine the international sporting institution, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disrupt transport systems in Ukraine, and destabilise democracies and target businesses. The same day, the two states released separate statements detailing the content of their respective attributions. Simultaneously to this joint attribution, four other states – Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the US – took part in a related collective attribution of actions to the Russian Federation. Concerning the US, it charged seven presumed agents of the GRU with cyber and disinformation operations the same day. In addition, states and international organisations – including France, the EU and NATO – made supportive statements without attributing any operations specifically to the GRU. The Russian Federation has rejected the accusations and arguments describing them as ‘strong paranoia’, an ‘anti-Russian spy mania campaign accompanied by deliberate leaks in the media’, or ‘staged propaganda campaigns.’ Attempts at collective attribution by NATO allies have also been ridiculed as enacted ‘at the\n\ncommand of Washington.’ Specifically, Russia maintains that public attribution is used as a tool to create ‘an additional pretext for sanctions or other measures to pressurise Russia.’ 7\n\nSuch declarations – beyond the ‘naming and shaming’ effect – do not always lead to concrete responses. Firstly, the attributing state may have limited options to act against these states. The attributing states had previously placed serious constraints on North Korea and Iran through country-specific sanctions, and, as highlighted by Thomas P. Bossert, the then Homeland Security Advisor to US President Donald Trump, in his speech attributing WannaCry to North Korea, they may be short of options: ‘President Trump has used just about every lever you can use, short of starving the people of North Korea to death, to change their behaviour. And so we don’t have a lot of room left here to apply pressure to change their behaviour.’ 8 Secondly, the harm caused by cyber operations is not always significant and can be qualified as a mere breach of territorial sovereignty which allows for a limited number of lawful unilateral measures that can be adopted by a victim state.\n\n# FROM COLLECTIVE ATTRIBUTION TO COLLECTIVE RESPONSE\n\nThe development of joint and collective attribution is also relevant from the point of view of its implications for the development of collective responses. The EU’s framework for a joint diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities, the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, is an\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",
    "CHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n57\n\nexample of such an initiative. However, some of the joint response mechanisms – and the sanctions regime in particular – rely heavily on the capacity to establish a link between an attack and a perpetrator. Given that attribution remains a sovereign right of each member state and that each country works with its own intelligence and analysis – in addition to the assessments and analysis provided by EU bodies such as CERT-EU and INTCEN – arriving at a collective understanding might be difficult. The EU member states have very diverse approaches towards (public) attribution of cyber operations, which may complicate the future implementation of this framework. France still refrains from attributing cyber operations publicly, while others, notably the UK and the Netherlands, have decided to take part in joint attribution with non-EU states.\n\nWith regard to a potential collective response, it is important to note that while collective self-defence is permitted under international law, collective countermeasures are not.9 Here it is important to recall the difference between measures of retorsion (such as targeted sanctions against individuals and companies, expulsion of diplomats) and countermeasures (such as sectoral and country-specific sanctions). This has important consequences in the cyber realm: since most cyber operations remain below the threshold of an armed attack, only countermeasures may be adopted in response. In such cases, the victim state would have to respond by itself only, and not collectively. It may, however, benefit from the aid and assistance of third states, without the third state conducting countermeasures itself.10 It must be clarified, however, that this legal limitation should not be interpreted as limiting the possibility to coordinate the sanctions through alliances or a common framework such as the EU Cyber Toolbox. International law prohibits a non-victim state from justifying unlawful acts it may impose as a countermeasure conducted on behalf of the victim state.11 Conversely, this is without consequence for the right of non-victim states to adopt measures of retorsion, in which category fall most sanctions that may be adopted, as well as to take part in a collective attribution.\n\n# THE JUDICIALISATION OF ATTRIBUTION\n\nThe attribution of a conduct by a state to another state usually takes the form of a statement by the former. Yet, in the context of cyber operations, another practice has emerged, notably in the United States, consisting of charging identified state agents with having carried out a cyber operation, and thus indirectly attributing the activity to a state. This ‘judicialised attribution’ may be conducted alone or in conjunction with other forms of attribution. For instance, on 6 September 2018 the US Department of Justice announced formal charges against Park Jin Hyok, a North Korean citizen, for his involvement in malicious cyber activities including the Sony Pictures hack, Central Bank cybertheft in\n\n9 See: Pierre-Emmanuel Dupont, “Countermeasures and Collective Security: The Case of the EU Sanctions Against Iran”, Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law, vol. 17, no. 3 (2012): pp. 301–36.\n\n10 It should be noted, however, that some states and scholars advocate the existence of a right of collective countermeasures pursuant the law of state responsibility. See, for instance: President of Estonia, “President of the Republic at the Opening of CyCon 2019”, May 2019, https://president.ee/en/official-duties/speeches/15241-president-of-the-republic-at-the-opening-of-cycon-2019/\n\n11 It is important to note at this stage, however, that the thematic sanctions adopted by the UN as part of its sanctions regime or under the EU’s autonomous sanction regimes target specific violations of international law or are adopted in response to persistent violations of international law such as the human rights conventions or the UN Security Council resolutions. Sanctions in such cases are political instruments tantamount to countermeasures that do not require any specific evidence to be presented.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms",

This makes it highly unlikely that he will ever face justice. For the same reasons, the sanctions adopted against him by the Department of the Treasury have a limited effect since most of his assets are located in North Korea. The US has charged in absentia other state agents in the cases of cyber operations allegedly conducted on behalf of China, Iran, North Korea and also Russia.\n\nThe US’s approach is interesting for the EU in as much as it already has a well-established law enforcement cooperation mechanism (through Europol or Red Notice alerts issued by Interpol) while still developing the operational dimension of the sanctions regime. The main challenges in that respect are linked to timespan and due process considerations that drive political and legal approaches to sanctions. While sanctions as a political tool\n\nThe potential of the US in the context of the law enforcement system, the government’s protection that the collected evidence may lead to a successful conviction in the court, the political decision to publicly attribute an attack to an individual or entity expresses definite conviction as to the guilt and leaves it to the court of public opinion to decide whether the political assignment of guilt is justified. Consequently, it could be argued that resorting to criminal indictments – which usually come with a lengthy explanation of the background to the decision, including a clear statement of the domestic law that has been violated and criminal sanctions associated with it – offers a more transparent and less politicised approach.\n\nIn cases of public attribution to individuals or organs of a state that have been made to date, on the other hand, we have not seen a similar level of detail, primarily due to the fact that there is no such requirement under international law.

In sum, charging alleged state agents is an effective tool for conveying a message towards the responsible state, without directly naming and shaming it.\n\n# EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS\n\nThe above discussion brings to the fore the question of different approaches to evidentiary standards. State practice on the public attribution of cyber operations to a state has been mainly unilateral. Interestingly, in the early cases of attribution by one state to another, very little evidence substantiating such claims has seen daylight. This is because most of the information on which such decisions are based is considered to be crucial for national security. However, there is a growing demand from the international community that an attribution be accompanied with supportive evidence. This evolution is reflected in the 2015 UNGGE Report¹⁶ and endorsed in the UN General Assembly as one of the ‘rules, norms and principles’ governing this domain.¹⁷ The proposed norm goes beyond recalling the states’ obligations regarding internationally wrongful acts attributable to them under international law. It also recalls that ‘accusations of organising and implementing wrongful acts brought against States should be substantiated,’ meaning that states should consider all relevant information, a broader context, challenges of attribution and the nature and extent of the consequences.¹⁸ The same section places strong emphasis on the fact that ‘the indication that an ICT activity was launched or otherwise originates from the territory or objects of the ICT infrastructure of a state may be insufficient in itself to attribute the activity to that state.’ The actual practice of some states exemplifies this development: whereas the United States’ attribution of the Sony Picture hack to North Korea in 2014 was not accompanied by supporting evidence, the attribution to Russia of the 2016 DNC hack was substantiated by the release of a supportive report.¹⁹\n\nIn most cases, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\n\nWith regard to evidence itself, there are three main challenges that need to be addressed in the context of attribution. First, in most cases, the necessary information and evidence required to identify the computers and individuals involved, as well as any sponsoring state, might be located in a foreign country. The identification and attribution processes may depend on the goodwill and cooperation of the foreign state. In that perspective, the Budapest Convention on cybercrime adopted in 2001 contains useful principles on international cooperation and mutual assistance (Articles 23 and 24 respectively). In June 2017, negotiations started for the adoption of a second additional protocol to the Budapest Convention that focuses on international cooperation and electronic evidence. Such a protocol would notably contribute to facilitate cross-border access to electronic evidence for criminal investigations.\n\nSecond, even though specialised government agencies and digital forensics companies have\n\n16 United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), “Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security,” UN Doc A/70/174, para 28(f).

    "CHAPTER 5 | Cosmic dust | Attribution and evidentiary standards\n\nthe risk that other malicious actors might feel emboldened to reuse or exploit similar vulnerabilities to perpetrate further cyber operations. This has been demonstrated by the WannaCry ransomware attack and the wave of cyberattacks that affected a large number of people, institutions and businesses in 2017. The same year, a different group used a similar but more aggressive version of this malware, NotPetya, to attack numerous government agencies around the world.\n\nFinally, while the production of the technical evidence regarding cyber operations takes a very specific and concrete form (malware computer code, IP addresses, logs, repeated patterns of activity, etc.), it is not sufficient to make definite claims about attribution. This is partly why such technical evidence can be falsified through so-called 'false flag' operations. In addition, the mere location of the computer established on the basis of its IP address cannot be treated as sufficient evidence given the ease with which such addresses can be changed. In most cases, therefore, the decisions about attribution involve gathering of all-source intelligence which states are unwilling to disclose.\n\nThe earlier sections of this *Chaillot Paper* have already addressed the question of the listing criteria as established by the EU's cyber sanctions regime. It is important to stress at this point that the decision about what constitutes a sufficient evidentiary base for listings will be decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. As the experience of the previously adopted horizontal regime for terrorism has shown in the Kadi cases, the Court has quite significant powers in that respect. The member states' decision to pool their sovereignty – also when it comes to the judicial review of EU law and state practice – makes the EU sanctions regime different from that adopted by the United States or from those likely to be adopted by other countries in the future. While decisions to attribute and impose sanctions are political decisions that do not always require public justification, EU law and the statute of the Court of Justice impose on member states specific requirements and a high level of scrutiny concerning due process and evidentiary standards, to which other states are not subjected.\n\n# CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe issue of attribution has dominated the conversation about the imposition of meaningful consequences in cyberspace. While some of the measures foreseen in the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox do not require assigning responsibility for a malicious cyber activity, cyber sanctions are at the other end of the spectrum. Whereas attribution is an important element in the international law of state responsibility – in that it makes it possible to assess what constitutes a legally acceptable response – the truth is that the decisions to attribute are primarily political in nature and therefore legal and political considerations cannot be neatly separated.\n\nBut the debate about attribution is often approached from the wrong angle: rather than being viewed as a means to an end, it is frequently portrayed as an end in itself. It is important, however, to establish the purpose of attribution as from the very beginning such decisions dictate what is considered as sufficient evidence. If the aim is to 'name and shame' the perpetrator, there is very little guidance on how much is enough – except for the judgment in the court of public opinion. The situation is quite the reverse if the ultimate objective is to bring the perpetrators to justice or constrain their operations through sanctions. In both these instances the evidentiary standards are likely to be higher.\n\nFinally, attribution brings to the fore several elements that usually determine the success or failure of a sanctions regime. For instance, states need to take a decision whether to attribute certain attacks while considering the broader political implications of such decisions. This means that in some cases it might prove to be more prudent not to point a finger at the perpetrator (e.g. in order not to interfere with the ongoing criminal law investigations). At the same time, some of the dilemmas mentioned earlier are closely linked to the questions of capabilities, resources and information-sharing mechanisms. As this chapter has demonstrated, not all countries have the capacity and resources to decide about attributing attacks, opting instead to work closely with other partners or through regional organisations.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:44:03 +00:00\n\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"
