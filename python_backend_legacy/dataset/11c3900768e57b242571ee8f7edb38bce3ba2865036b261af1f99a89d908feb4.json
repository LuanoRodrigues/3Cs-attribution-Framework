These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\n\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n\n# Introduction\n\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet (Ueland 2020); owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software (Ahmed 2020); connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services (Thomas 2020; The Software Report 2019). The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\n\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships (NIAC 2019; CSC 2020; Brown 2018). A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online",

In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve (Kuhn 2012). The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\n\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors (Nakasone & Sulmeyer 2020). Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace (DoD 2018).\n\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\n\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\n\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\n\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad",

As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\n\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\n\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative (Temple-Raston 2019). In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" (DoD 2018). It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" (DoD 2018). The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\n\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone (JFQ 2019), who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\n\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

            "markdown": "In sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\n\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” (DoD 2015), which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\n\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n\n### Centrality of Initiative\n\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\n\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\n\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere (Jomini 2005). This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for",

The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\n\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition (POTUS 2017). In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" (Manea 2014). The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\n\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\n\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\n\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\n\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n\n## Anticipatory resilience\n\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\n\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” (Ross et al. 2019).\n\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” (Ross et al. 2019). This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\n\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value (Work 2019). One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\n\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale (Donati 2020). The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation (Gabrielle 2020). While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).",

Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign (O’Sullivan 2019; The Guardian 2019). Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\n\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\n\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” (Rosenberger 2018).\n\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims (Miller 2020).\n\n## Defend forward\n\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners.

Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\n\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are (Nakasone 2019).\n\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD (Work 2019). The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\n\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\n\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work (Flynn 2020). To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

            "markdown": "Persistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n\n## Contest\n\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\n\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action (Lerner 2014). The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” (Lerner 2014).\n\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike (Franceschi-Bicchierai 2015; Justice News 2014), and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation (Sanger 2020). CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use (Paganini 2013). These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\n\nJournal of Information Warfare",

Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\n\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\n\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\n\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace. This foundation can be leveraged going forward and can drive recommendations for potential industrial policy changes involving both regulations and incentives so that persistent engagement can scale for the nation.\n\n## References\n\nAhmed, A 2020, Top 10 largest IT and software companies in the world (2020), BAC website, Kolkata, India, viewed November 2020, <https: blog=\"\" top-10-largest-it-and-software-companies-in-the-world=\"\" www.businessalphabets.com=\"\"></https:>.\n\nAlger, J 1982, The quest for victory: The history of the principles of war, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, US.\n\nBBC News 2020, Coronavirus: Unit set up to counter false claims, BBC News website, British Broadcasting Corporation, London, England, UK, viewed November 2020, <https: news=\"\" uk-politics-51800216=\"\" www.bbc.com=\"\">.\n\nJournal of Information Warfare</https:>",

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n# Introduction\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet (Ueland 2020); owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software (Ahmed 2020); connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services (Thomas 2020; The Software Report 2019). The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships (NIAC 2019; CSC 2020; Brown 2018). A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nAbsent from these efforts are shared assumptions and concepts that guide how members of both communities view the problem and devise solutions. In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve (Kuhn 2012). The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors (Nakasone & Sulmeyer 2020). Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace (DoD 2018).\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nversary strategic cyberspace campaigns that deliberately take place outside of armed conflict. As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative (Temple-Raston 2019). In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" (DoD 2018). It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" (DoD 2018). The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone (JFQ 2019), who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\nJournal of Information Warfare\nIn sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” (DoD 2015), which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n### Centrality of Initiative\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere (Jomini 2005). This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nmitigation or exploitation for the purpose of ensuring security rather than waiting to become aware of them after adversary exploitation reflects initiative but not offense. The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition (POTUS 2017). In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" (Manea 2014). The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n(US Cyber Command 2018a). By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n## Anticipatory resilience\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof or make their behaviour appear to result from other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster”. They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” (Ross et al. 2019).\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” (Ross et al. 2019). This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value (Work 2019). One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale (Donati 2020). The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation (Gabrielle 2020). While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nAugust 2019 was a turning point, when Twitter disclosed a covert “significant state-backed information operation” originating from the People’s Republic of China targeting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign (O’Sullivan 2019; The Guardian 2019). Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” (Rosenberger 2018).\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims (Miller 2020).\n## Defend forward\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners. Insights gained from operating beyond one’s networks enable anticipatory resilience by\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nallowing owners to take actions within their systems to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are (Nakasone 2019).\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD (Work 2019). The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work (Flynn 2020). To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n## Contest\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action (Lerner 2014). The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” (Lerner 2014).\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike (Franceschi-Bicchierai 2015; Justice News 2014), and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation (Sanger 2020). CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use (Paganini 2013). These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n## Conclusion\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nproviders, domain name registrars, software developers, application developers, and Internet service providers), and content (online content providers and search engines) (eSilva 2017).\nApplying generic understandings of the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest reveals that many parts of the private sector are already persistently engaged in cyberspace. Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace.

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n# Introduction\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet ; owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software ; connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services . The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships . A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nAbsent from these efforts are shared assumptions and concepts that guide how members of both communities view the problem and devise solutions. In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve . The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors . Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace .\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nversary strategic cyberspace campaigns that deliberately take place outside of armed conflict. As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative . In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" . It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" . The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone , who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\nJournal of Information Warfare\nIn sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” , which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n### Centrality of Initiative\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere . This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nmitigation or exploitation for the purpose of ensuring security rather than waiting to become aware of them after adversary exploitation reflects initiative but not offense. The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition . In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" . The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n(US Cyber Command 2018a). By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n## Anticipatory resilience\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof or make their behaviour appear to result from other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster”. They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” .\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” . This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value . One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale . The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation . While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nAugust 2019 was a turning point, when Twitter disclosed a covert “significant state-backed information operation” originating from the People’s Republic of China targeting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign . Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” .\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims .\n## Defend forward\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners. Insights gained from operating beyond one’s networks enable anticipatory resilience by\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nallowing owners to take actions within their systems to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are .\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD . The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work . To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n## Contest\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action . The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” .\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike , and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation . CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use . These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n## Conclusion\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nproviders, domain name registrars, software developers, application developers, and Internet service providers), and content (online content providers and search engines) (eSilva 2017).\nApplying generic understandings of the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest reveals that many parts of the private sector are already persistently engaged in cyberspace. Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace. This foundation can be leveraged going forward and can drive recommendations for potential industrial policy changes involving both regulations and incentives so that persistent engagement can scale for the nation.",

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n# Introduction\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet ; owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software ; connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services . The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships . A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nAbsent from these efforts are shared assumptions and concepts that guide how members of both communities view the problem and devise solutions. In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve . The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors . Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace .\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nversary strategic cyberspace campaigns that deliberately take place outside of armed conflict. As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative . In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" . It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" . The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone , who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\nJournal of Information Warfare\nIn sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” , which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n### Centrality of Initiative\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere . This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nmitigation or exploitation for the purpose of ensuring security rather than waiting to become aware of them after adversary exploitation reflects initiative but not offense. The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition . In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" . The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n(US Cyber Command 2018a). By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n## Anticipatory resilience\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof or make their behaviour appear to result from other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster”. They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” .\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” . This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value . One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale . The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation . While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nAugust 2019 was a turning point, when Twitter disclosed a covert “significant state-backed information operation” originating from the People’s Republic of China targeting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign . Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” .\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims .\n## Defend forward\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners. Insights gained from operating beyond one’s networks enable anticipatory resilience by\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nallowing owners to take actions within their systems to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are .\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD . The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work . To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n## Contest\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action . The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” .\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike , and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation . CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use . These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n## Conclusion\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nproviders, domain name registrars, software developers, application developers, and Internet service providers), and content (online content providers and search engines) (eSilva 2017).\nApplying generic understandings of the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest reveals that many parts of the private sector are already persistently engaged in cyberspace. Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace. This foundation can be leveraged going forward and can drive recommendations for potential industrial policy changes involving both regulations and incentives so that persistent engagement can scale for the nation.",

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n# Introduction\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet (Ueland 2020); owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software (Ahmed 2020); connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services (Thomas 2020; The Software Report 2019). The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships (NIAC 2019; CSC 2020; Brown 2018). A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nAbsent from these efforts are shared assumptions and concepts that guide how members of both communities view the problem and devise solutions. In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve (Kuhn 2012). The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors (Nakasone & Sulmeyer 2020). Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace (DoD 2018).\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nversary strategic cyberspace campaigns that deliberately take place outside of armed conflict. As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative (Temple-Raston 2019). In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" (DoD 2018). It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" (DoD 2018). The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone (JFQ 2019), who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\nJournal of Information Warfare\nIn sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” (DoD 2015), which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n### Centrality of Initiative\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere (Jomini 2005). This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nmitigation or exploitation for the purpose of ensuring security rather than waiting to become aware of them after adversary exploitation reflects initiative but not offense. The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition (POTUS 2017). In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" (Manea 2014). The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n(US Cyber Command 2018a). By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n## Anticipatory resilience\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof or make their behaviour appear to result from other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster”. They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” (Ross et al. 2019).\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” (Ross et al. 2019). This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value (Work 2019). One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale (Donati 2020). The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation (Gabrielle 2020). While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nAugust 2019 was a turning point, when Twitter disclosed a covert “significant state-backed information operation” originating from the People’s Republic of China targeting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign (O’Sullivan 2019; The Guardian 2019). Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” (Rosenberger 2018).\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims (Miller 2020).\n## Defend forward\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners. Insights gained from operating beyond one’s networks enable anticipatory resilience by\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nallowing owners to take actions within their systems to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are (Nakasone 2019).\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD (Work 2019). The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work (Flynn 2020). To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n## Contest\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action (Lerner 2014). The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” (Lerner 2014).\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike (Franceschi-Bicchierai 2015; Justice News 2014), and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation (Sanger 2020). CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use (Paganini 2013). These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n## Conclusion\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nproviders, domain name registrars, software developers, application developers, and Internet service providers), and content (online content providers and search engines) (eSilva 2017).\nApplying generic understandings of the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest reveals that many parts of the private sector are already persistently engaged in cyberspace. Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace. This foundation can be leveraged going forward and can drive recommendations for potential industrial policy changes involving both regulations and incentives so that persistent engagement can scale for the nation."

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n# Introduction\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet (Ueland 2020); owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software (Ahmed 2020); connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services (Thomas 2020; The Software Report 2019). The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships (NIAC 2019; CSC 2020; Brown 2018). A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nAbsent from these efforts are shared assumptions and concepts that guide how members of both communities view the problem and devise solutions. In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve (Kuhn 2012). The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors (Nakasone & Sulmeyer 2020). Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace (DoD 2018).\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nversary strategic cyberspace campaigns that deliberately take place outside of armed conflict. As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative (Temple-Raston 2019). In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" (DoD 2018). It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" (DoD 2018). The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone (JFQ 2019), who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\nJournal of Information Warfare\nIn sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy (DoD 2018) with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” (DoD 2015), which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n### Centrality of Initiative\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere (Jomini 2005). This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nmitigation or exploitation for the purpose of ensuring security rather than waiting to become aware of them after adversary exploitation reflects initiative but not offense. The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition (POTUS 2017). In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" (Manea 2014). The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n(US Cyber Command 2018a). By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n## Anticipatory resilience\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof or make their behaviour appear to result from other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster”. They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” (Ross et al. 2019).\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” (Ross et al. 2019). This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value (Work 2019). One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale (Donati 2020). The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation (Gabrielle 2020). While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nAugust 2019 was a turning point, when Twitter disclosed a covert “significant state-backed information operation” originating from the People’s Republic of China targeting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign (O’Sullivan 2019; The Guardian 2019). Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” (Rosenberger 2018).\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims (Miller 2020).\n## Defend forward\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners. Insights gained from operating beyond one’s networks enable anticipatory resilience by\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nallowing owners to take actions within their systems to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are (Nakasone 2019).\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD (Work 2019). The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work (Flynn 2020). To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n## Contest\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action (Lerner 2014). The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” (Lerner 2014).\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike (Franceschi-Bicchierai 2015; Justice News 2014), and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation (Sanger 2020). CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use (Paganini 2013). These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n## Conclusion\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nproviders, domain name registrars, software developers, application developers, and Internet service providers), and content (online content providers and search engines) (eSilva 2017).\nApplying generic understandings of the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest reveals that many parts of the private sector are already persistently engaged in cyberspace. Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace. This foundation can be leveraged going forward and can drive recommendations for potential industrial policy changes involving both regulations and incentives so that persistent engagement can scale for the nation."

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.\nKeywords: Persistent Engagement, Cyber, Strategy, Private Sector\n# Introduction\nBoth the public and private sectors play critical roles in the digital ecosystem. Governments make and enforce laws, protect property rights, regulate private entities, and can also create incentives to develop, grow, and sustain new markets and enterprises. The private sector is largely responsible for the physical and logical cyberspace terrain that underlays modern societies and economies. It provides access to the Internet ; owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure (US Chamber of Commerce 2020); builds the hardware and software ; connects people to one another and to ideas, services, and products; and provides a wide array of specialised cybersecurity services . The private sector also performs roles traditionally associated with the state—such as cyber threat intelligence; attribution; and, in some cases, taking action to prevent or to stop illicit cyber activity.\nEvery discussion of cyber threats and cybersecurity acknowledges the private sector’s critical position in the digital ecosystem and the need to improve collaboration between the public and private sectors. Most analyses, studies, commissions, reports, and cyber strategies call for better public-private partnerships . A plethora of recommendations on information and data sharing arrangements, operational pilots, executive panels, consortiums, joint initiatives, fusion cells, and collaborative environments strive to achieve the elusive public-private partnerships that often underdeliver, despite the good faith efforts of those involved.\nJournal of Information Warfare (2021) 20.2: 107-121\nISSN 1445-3312 Print/ISSN 1445-3347 Online\nAbsent from these efforts are shared assumptions and concepts that guide how members of both communities view the problem and devise solutions. In scientific discourse, this is called a paradigm. Paradigms define the important problems for a group of practitioners to solve . The paradigm's assumptions must align with reality if progress is to be meaningful. Its concepts must resonate across the community of practitioners—a tall order if that community comprises both government officials who provide public goods and private actors motivated by a huge diversity of incentives including but not limited to turning a profit. Moreover, the ‘private sector' label includes entities with very different and sometimes competing or even conflicting interests.\nThat being said, persistent engagement, an operational approach emphasising competing with adversaries now, continuously, and proactively, applies to both sectors . Seizing and maintaining initiative to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace benefits public and private sector interests. This article demonstrates how the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest, which comprise how the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) addresses malicious cyber activity in day-to-day competition, captures much of what the private sector does in cyberspace .\nFinally, the assumptions and elements of persistent engagement constitute a paradigm, which identifies distinctive cyberspace problems requiring novel solutions beyond standard approaches like information sharing and cybersecurity intelligence.\nAs one example, persistent engagement views cyberspace as an environment of continuous contact with actors persistently exploiting one another's vulnerabilities for gain. Policies and strategies that, like deterrence, assume an environment of operational restraint and episodic contact cannot address what persistent engagement identifies as the critical challenge. Continuous widescale hostile cyberspace campaigns comprised of actions that individually never rise to a level that elicits a severe (kinetic) response are deliberately calibrated to fall short of generating armed attack equivalent effects, yet which cumulatively produce strategic gains historically unattainable without war. If both sectors share a set of concepts aligned to the strategic and operational realities of cyberspace and a common understanding of cyberspace challenges, they can work together more effectively to address those challenges with the end goal of creating a whole-of-nation cyber strategy.\n### Origins of Persistent Engagement\nIn March 2018, U.S. Cyber Command released Achieve and Maintain Cyberspace Superiority (US Cyber Command 2018b), introducing the terms ‘persistent engagement' and ‘defend forward' into the DoD lexicon. ‘Defend forward' was one of three operational concepts to achieve and maintain strategic advantage in cyberspace. The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  also adopted the term ‘defend forward'. Cyber Command and DoD both refer to ‘defend forward' as a strategy and ‘persistent engagement' as an operational approach to implementing that strategy. Nakasone and Sulmeyer (2020) recently described ‘persistent engagement' as a Cyber Command doctrine. This paper adapts the approach of persistent engagement to the private sector and the authors' use of the term of ‘defend forward' reflects an operational understanding of it.\nPersistent engagement entails continuous rather than episodic action—being proactive and anticipatory, rather than restrained and reactive. For military cyber forces, persistent engagement focuses planning and operations on defending against, countering, contesting, and precluding ad\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nversary strategic cyberspace campaigns that deliberately take place outside of armed conflict. As a cybersecurity paradigm, persistent engagement's concentration on continuous, virtual aggression represents a significant departure from the paradigm of deterrence, which emerged out of a specific strategic environment created by nuclear weapons and that views aggression primarily in terms of episodic events in physical space.\nPersistent engagement followed from an analysis of the strategic and operational environments. The central strategic challenge facing the U.S. is the emergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia. The competition is playing out in cyberspace because of the operational environment's characteristics: globally interconnected; low barriers to entry; contested terrain; absence of formal agreements on acceptable and unacceptable behaviour; and no sanctuary or operational pause.\nPersistent engagement gained momentum through operational experience. Operation Glowing Symphony, U.S. Cyber Command's first global-scale operation to persistently disrupt and degrade the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) infrastructure worldwide, gave Cyber Command both confidence in its tactics, organisation, and capabilities, and a feeling for how campaigns can be won in cyberspace by seizing and retaining the operational initiative . In 2018, the DoD published a new cyber strategy, which drew on lessons learned from the success of Operation Glowing Symphony. The new strategy recognised the need to \"take action in cyberspace during day-to-day competition to preserve U.S. military advantages and to defend U.S. interests\" . It called for defending forward in cyberspace \"to disrupt or halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of armed conflict\" . The new approach was put to the test as part of the U.S. government's broader efforts to protect the 2018 mid-term elections from Russian interference. The successful defence of the elections validated defend forward and persistent engagement in the eyes of military leaders, defence policy officials, and Congressional overseers.\nIt is worth quoting at length General Nakasone , who describes key assumptions of persistent engagement:\nFirst, our nation is in constant contact with its adversaries; we're not waiting for adversaries to come to us. Our adversaries understand this, and they are always working to improve that contact. Second, our security is challenged in cyberspace. We have to actively defend; we have to conduct reconnaissance; we have to understand where our adversary is and his capabilities; and we have to understand their intent. Third, superiority in cyberspace is temporary; we may achieve it for a period of time, but it's ephemeral. That's why we must operate continuously to seize and maintain the initiative in the face of persistent threats. Why do the threats persist in cyberspace? They persist because the barriers to entry are low and the capabilities are rapidly available and can be easily repurposed. Fourth, in this domain, the advantage favors those who have initiative. If we want to have an advantage in cyberspace, we have to actively work to either improve our defenses, create new accesses, or upgrade our capabilities. This is a domain that requires constant action because we're going to get reactions from our adversary. (emphasis added)\nJournal of Information Warfare\nIn sum, persistent engagement assumes an environment of continuous engagement with actors relentlessly seeking advantage over one another and doing so at an unprecedented scale in campaigns that yield cumulative gains without risking armed conflict.\nThe Department of Defense Cyber Strategy  with its defend forward concept and Cyber Command's supporting operational approach of persistent engagement represent a sea change in thought and practice. They are a significant departure from the DoD Cyber Strategy's “doctrine of restraint” , which prioritised network defence and law enforcement responses over military operations. They also depart from previous policy guidance, which limited DoD cyber operations within the confines of its own networks—DoD Information Networks. The exceptions were for circumscribed operations within designated areas of hostilities to support combat operations and to respond to cyberattacks of significant consequence. The United States finally brought the DoD off the sidelines and into strategic competition in cyberspace.\nThese concepts continue to be refined based on real-world operations against adaptive and persistent threats. It is a natural next step to consider how private sector insights, capabilities, and capacities dovetail with persistent engagement as currently conceived, and whether persistent engagement can serve as a whole-of-nation framework for collective defence in cyberspace.\n### Centrality of Initiative\nAt its core, persistent engagement means continuously seeking initiative to set the conditions of security and the terms of competition in one's favour. Operating continuously in the face of persistent threats keeps one a step ahead in both knowledge and action, anticipating what vulnerabilities competitors plan to exploit and how they may do so, and adapting before they are weaponised or exploited rather than reacting to what has occurred.\nSeizing initiative in competition is at the heart of corporate approaches to turbulent competitive environments, where competent and resourceful opponents risk eroding any advantage one currently holds. According to MacMillan (1988), the corporate strategist must constantly strive “First, to seize initiative—by securing and maintaining the strategic initiative; and second, to anticipate competitively—by anticipating the responses of each of the various competitors”. In key ways, persistent engagement more naturally aligns to the corporate mindset than it does to the military mindset, which focuses more on prevailing in war than on strategic competition short of war. Moreover, corporate approaches seek to seize the initiative but do not expect to achieve dominance. Likewise, persistent engagement aims to achieve superiority—a carefully chosen military doctrinal concept. This is not dominance, but rather the degree of dominance at a given time and place that permits the secure, reliable conduct of operations without prohibitive adversarial interference (Joint Chiefs of Staff 2018). It could easily be replaced with ‘initiative'.\nSeizing and retaining the initiative is integral to military operational art. In The Art of War, Henri Jomini argues that the competitor who seizes the initiative has the advantage over the competitor that must react and defend everywhere . This idea is enshrined as a principle of war and is typically associated with the offense. US Army Field Manual FM 3-0 describes ‘Seize Initiative' as a phase in crisis or combat that “involves conducting reconnaissance, maintaining security, performing defensive and offensive tasks at the earliest possible time, forcing the enemy to culminate offensively, and setting the conditions for decisive operations” (US Army 2017). Initiative in persistent engagement, however, is not all offense. For example, seeking out vulnerabilities for\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nmitigation or exploitation for the purpose of ensuring security rather than waiting to become aware of them after adversary exploitation reflects initiative but not offense. The difference is one of seizing initiative in competition short of war (to set the conditions for security) rather than seizing initiative in war (to set the conditions for decisive operations).\nThe national security enterprise has had to adapt to the 2017 National Security Strategy's organising principle of strategic competition . In the 1980s, the DoD adopted the idea of competitive strategies for long-term strategic competition with the Soviet Union. These were associated with peacetime interaction and the \"peacetime use of military power to shape a competitor's choices in ways that favour our objectives\" . The peace-war dichotomy, however, maps poorly to cyberspace where competitors constantly manoeuvre to make strategic gains, whether their military forces are in physical contact or not.\nThe DoD's emphasis on deterring war (and prevailing should it occur) also led to the reflexive application to cyberspace of coercive strategies designed to prevent armed conflict in the physical domains. Coercive strategies like deterrence, which call for operational restraint and threats of prospective action, align poorly to cyberspace where initiative and continuous engagement are rewarded. Cyber strategy theorists Fischerkeller and Harknett (2019) explain how structural imperatives and strategic incentives drive states to be active in cyberspace outside of armed conflict. Therefore, security cannot be attained with strategies that aim to deter actors from being active. The key flaw has been focusing on shaping the opponent's decision calculus toward restraint when the incentives to be active in cyberspace are overwhelming. Instead, the focus should be on shaping the conditions of competition in an environment that presents numerous opportunities for exploitation. In cyberspace, the adversary must be understood, but security need not and in fact does not rest in the minds of the adversary; rather it rests in one's own hands. This requires persistent efforts to seize and maintain initiative (Hoffman &amp; Levite 2017).\n## Applying Persistent Engagement to Private Sector Cybersecurity\nPersistent engagement is more aligned to the private-sector outlook toward security than is the default framework of coercion applied by state actors. Persistent engagement leverages the competitive impulse of industry actors to seize and maintain initiative against rivals and competitors. Many companies and sectors (such as biotech and aerospace) share the state's interests in setting favourable conditions in cyberspace to enhance security and prosperity if intellectual property theft threatens their market share and commercial viability. Other companies and sectors, such as those that make the Internet infrastructure or Internet-enabled products, who prosper based on speed to market, may require government incentives and/or regulations to increase security. Persistent engagement would complement efforts to incentivise and regulate to compel private actors to adopt public goods priorities.\nU.S. Cyber Command is persistently engaging and applying the operational concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest. For example, the Cyber Command defends forward through consensual network defence (hunt forward) operations on foreign partner networks. When directed, the Command contests adversary campaigns and objectives as it did in the run up to the 2018 U.S. Congressional elections. Insights generated through these activities feed anticipatory resilience, as demonstrated by the practice of uploading malware samples on public websites, in order to publicise and render it detectable by commercial threat intelligence and corporate defence\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n(US Cyber Command 2018a). By framing and applying the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest outside the military context of the U.S. Cyber Command vision where they originated, the private sector is clearly already persistently engaging in cyberspace. Moreover, government agencies can certainly learn from industry perspectives on strategic competition based on the concepts of marketing, branding, and competitive intelligence, for example.\nFigure 1: Applying persistent engagement to the private sector\n## Anticipatory resilience\nMost definitions of resilience encompass some combination of prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. Goldman (2010) emphasised “the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operations”, which requires a “combination of protections, detections, and adaptive technical and operational responses”. Comfort, Boin, and Demchak (2010) defined resilience broadly as the capacity “to proactively adapt to and recover from disturbances that are perceived within the system to fall outside the range of normal and expected disturbances”.\nAnticipatory resilience leverages insights gained from continuous operations against highly capable adversaries to inform prevention, preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery. In this way, persistent engagement blends resilience and forward disruption. Anticipatory resilience has much in common with a cyber resiliency engineering approach, which defines resiliency as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that include cyber resources” (emphasis added, Ross et al. 2019). It focuses on the deliberate behaviour of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) and their new and unanticipated attack methods. Ross et al. (2019) argued “the resources associated with the APT, its stealthy nature, its persistent focus on the target of interest, and its ability to adapt in the face of defender actions make it a highly dangerous threat. Moreover, APT actors can take advantage\nJournal of Information Warfare\nof or make their behaviour appear to result from other forms of adversity, including human error, structural failure, or natural disaster”. They “execute cyber campaigns that can involve multiple systems and organisations and can extend for periods of months or even years” .\nPersistent engagement's operational concept of anticipatory resilience, like the resiliency engineering approach, “requires specialized expertise about how the APT can find and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber resources, as well as about techniques that could be used to reduce the associated risks” . This captures U.S. Cyber Command's efforts to leverage insights gained from defend forward and contest operations about vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and indicators and warning that APTs may attack. Cyber Command can use these insights to support its own cyber resiliency efforts as well as those of partners and critical infrastructure owners and operators. Continuous monitoring of competitors' systems, processes, and capabilities must be accompanied by continuous monitoring and assessment of one's own systems, processes, and capabilities—in order to identify vulnerabilities that could result from myriad routine software, hardware, and process changes that continually occur. This includes changes by other system owners (as well as their capabilities to defend or mitigate) to which one's systems are connected.\nThe private sector has much to contribute to anticipatory resilience. Private sector internal defence measures include end-point observation, port scanning, firewall observation, network monitoring, observability via log events, inventory review maintenance for cloud infrastructure, malware analysis, threat reporting, and malicious activity reporting. Most importantly, all of these activities take place inside private sector networks, yielding visibility on a broad array of adversary activity, even compromises of lesser-value systems that, while they may not be of immediate interest to competitors, can provide positional advantage for future targets of higher value . One of the biggest advantages that companies which provide cybersecurity services to domestic companies, as well as those which provide cybersecurity themselves, have over the government is the ability to see inside domestic networks and client networks in foreign countries. High-end security companies also depend heavily on hiring globally to enable local access to adversary tradecraft to conduct resiliency operations. Thus, they understand how best to operationalise insights about malicious cyber activity to dynamically inform changes to the network security of critical infrastructure owners and operators, such as mitigating exploitable vulnerabilities and changing network terrain to inoculate them from attack before malware is ever deployed. While these activities are routine for the private sector and their paying clients, sharing the information with the U.S. government, which could then act on it or sharing with non-paying entities, is not.\nSocial media platform owners are uniquely positioned to expose, disrupt, mitigate, respond, and recover from disinformation campaigns—if the malicious activity relies on exploiting cyber vulnerabilities or leverages the Internet's global reach to achieve unprecedented scale . The U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center is responsible for exposing and countering foreign disinformation and propaganda efforts but has little capability to affect social media and messaging platforms vulnerable to exploitation . While governments are ramping up efforts to counter disinformation (BBC News 2020), America's still-dominant Internet companies can play an outsized role because they have more opportunities to combat influence operations than do governments. Social media companies control platform policies, have insight into their platforms' use, and possess domain-specific expertise to create tailored solutions (Thomas, Thompson & Wanless 2020).\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nAugust 2019 was a turning point, when Twitter disclosed a covert “significant state-backed information operation” originating from the People’s Republic of China targeting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Twitter removed 936 accounts and suspended approximately 200,000 illegitimate accounts. This was the first time the platform publicly identified and removed a Chinese disinformation campaign . Twitter released the following statement: “Covert, manipulative behaviours have no place on our service – they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.” Twitter also took the unprecedented step of banning all advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Insights gained from understanding the establishment and operations behind China’s information operations combined with the analytical techniques used to discover the activity complement the US government’s anticipatory resilience activities.\nSocial media platform owners can become more effective in preventing disinformation and influence campaigns by adopting persistent engagement’s focus on ‘campaigns’ rather than ‘incidents’. Current platform-use policies reflect a piecemeal approach, a “patchwork of community standards that apply to individual activities of an influence campaign, not the operation as a whole... This approach attempts to neatly categorize and distinguish actors (foreign versus domestic), motives (political influence and profit), activities (including misrepresentation, fraud, and spamming behavior), and content (such as misinformation, hate speech, and abuse)” (Thomas, Thompson &amp; Wanless 2020). Persistent engagement reveals that influence campaigns are more than the individual behaviours that compose them.\nTechnology companies also have a key role to play in promoting anticipatory resilience by identifying threats in new technology before they are exploited and weaponised. Artificial intelligence, for example, offers new tools to combat information manipulation, while also the means to increase it through ‘deepfakes’. The modus operandi of ‘fast to market’ and ‘deal with downsides’ after a product is released into the wild is deeply entrenched but could be shifting. Alex Stamos, departing CSO at Facebook, told his colleagues, “we need to think adversarially in every process, product and engineering decision we make” .\nFinally, Internet service providers can see how adversaries target critical infrastructure, including electric grids, dams, and airports, every day. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is made aware of the vulnerabilities to these systems but has no authority to warn potential victims. The Senate’s annual National Defense Authorization Act, if signed into law, would give CISA the power to issue subpoenas to Internet service providers—compelling them to release information on cyber vulnerabilities detected on critical infrastructure networks and to warn their owners that they are open and vulnerable to cyberattacks before they become victims .\n## Defend forward\nDefend forward, as an operational concept supporting persistent engagement, comprises activities outside one’s networks to enhance warning and mitigation, to preclude adversary options, and preposition assets in time, be they technical sensors or personnel (US Army 2001). With enhanced warning of competitor actions, intentions, and capabilities, one can better defend networks, data, and platforms. With access to competitor tactics, techniques, and procedures prior to their use, cyber operators can assess the threat, develop mitigations, and disseminate threat information to partners. Insights gained from operating beyond one’s networks enable anticipatory resilience by\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nallowing owners to take actions within their systems to remove exploitable vulnerabilities. Owners and operators can change their network terrain to inoculate them from attack and can better design and test platform and system vulnerabilities based on knowledge of competitor capabilities.\nDefend forward has a potential ancillary effect of causing competitors doubt and uncertainty. Shadowing the most dangerous actors in cyberspace can keep them constantly on guard and off balance and can facilitate swift attribution. Defend forward does this by operating defensively, not offensively, beyond one's network perimeter to expose, understand, and confound competitors' activities and operations as close as practicable to the source, before their effects reach one's own or others' networks; and to discover vulnerabilities outside one's own networks. With that knowledge, one can set the security conditions in one's favour. Fischerkeller (2020) points out that what matters most in cyber strategic competition is not that assets are forward but that they are seizing the initiative. The U.S. has stationed thousands of conventional troops overseas, but these are a deterrence and response force, waiting to react to aggression, not a persistence force, as deployed cyber forces are .\nWithin strict legal restrictions, private companies conduct defend-forward-like activities on global infrastructure and networks such as malware discovery; Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) discovery in support of cyber threat intelligence, attribution, indications and warning. Estimates in 2018 put the commercial cyber intelligence industry at 45 firms with a combined market value of $1.5 billion USD . The industry provides an array of services and products tailored to different customers in the context of a vigorous competition for market share. These private companies clearly have expanded into an area traditionally the prerogative of states and their intelligence agencies. Many states recognise the value of their information and have developed relationships to leverage it because the insights often are derived from sources not accessible to military and intelligence entities.\nAnother area where the private sector parallels traditional state activities is attribution. Private sector cybersecurity companies possess the advanced capabilities to attribute malicious cyber activity to states or state-sponsored actors to the point of rivalling the capabilities of some government intelligence agencies (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019). While governments have advantages in political attribution (understanding context, political purpose, and motives, which leads to the highest level of confidence when attributing a cyber incident to a nation's command and control entity), the private sector is as capable, or in some cases more capable, at technical attribution. Private companies hired to provide cybersecurity services have visibility into their clients' domestic computing networks, while their sensors installed on customer networks globally provide the visibility and access that allows them to identify and to track threats more quickly than the U.S. government. Law enforcement agencies, for example, must comply with legal processes in order to acquire similar information (Romanosky &amp; Boudreau 2019).\nFinally, major U.S. tech companies protecting users' data globally could be a bulwark against the spread of digital authoritarianism, although this is an area where a complex array of private sector motivations are at work . To the extent the private sector supports an open Internet and information freedom, it is policy driven, subsector dependent, and/or not paralleled in foreign private tech sectors. Cybersecurity companies have a net positive track record of pressuring certain foreign regimes—particularly China, Russia, and Iran. That is often driven by policy, however, because many of their clients are government bodies.\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\n## Contest\n‘Contest’ refers to actions that create cyber effects outside one’s networks in order to undermine a competitor’s ability to conduct malicious acts. This includes directly blocking, disrupting, or delaying adversary operations; or indirectly frustrating campaigns and objectives by injecting friction into a competitor’s systems and organisations to increase doubt and undermine confidence in their people, capabilities, tactics, and/or tools. The goal is to get the adversary to shift resources and effort from offensive operations to defensive mitigation measures.\nPrivate sector contest operations have occurred most visibly in infrastructure takedowns. Botnets—networks of hijacked computers surreptitiously infected with malware and controlled by an individual or group—have been used for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Bitcoin mining, stealing personally identifiable information and other confidential information, and illicitly acquiring intellectual property. A maturing botnet economy threatens financial losses on a scale that quickly becomes a national security issue. Moreover, the convergence of TTPs and tools used by all malicious actors due to the release of operational activities and tools in the ecosystem are the single biggest factors in the ever-increasing difficulty of attribution. States have already recognised the military applications of botnets (Koziel &amp; Robinson 2011). The DDoS attack launched against Estonia in 2007 has not been attributed to the Russian government, but hostile states often count on copycat hackers, criminal groups, and freelance political actors joining the cause. Prior to 2013, the primary methods to mitigate botnets were commercial security software, criminal enforcement, botnet seizure by federal agencies, and private civil action . The first option is inherently passive while the remaining “judicially enforced remedies can only react to past and ongoing attacks, not thwart an attack before it happens” .\nThe 2013 takedown of the Citadel botnet was the first of its kind with Microsoft exercising its independent civil authorities in coordination with domestic and foreign law enforcement and pursuant to court-approved procedures (US Senate 2014). Similar public-private cooperation occurred in the takedown of the ZeroAccess botnet in December 2013 with Symantec, the GameOver Zeus botnet in June 2014 with CrowdStrike , and the Kelihos botnet in 2017 with CrowdStrike (Justice News 2017). In March 2020, Microsoft participated with 35 nations in the biggest takedown ever of the Necurs botnet, which took nearly a decade to figure out. Although Necurs is not believed to be a state-sponsored Russian group, it is likely tolerated by Kremlin intelligence services because such private actors often further state goals. For the 18th time in ten years, Microsoft took down a digital criminal operation . CrowdStrike is reportedly exploring all legal methods to retrieve stolen information from hackers or deleting it to avoid its use . These examples of private sector law enforcement coordination predate persistent engagement; the goal moving forward should be to create synergies with U.S. Cyber Command efforts when doing so makes sense.\n## Conclusion\nPersistent engagement calls for manoeuvring seamlessly across the interconnected environment of cyberspace, globally and continuously, to seize and maintain initiative. Seamless manoeuvre, by definition, engages the private sector because it builds, owns, and operates most of the cyberspace terrain. American institutions and corporations retain significant influence over the technical aspects of computing, networking, and telecommunications. They are uniquely postured to manage and shape key aspects of the cyberspace environment. Critical elements include those responsible for physical infrastructure (hardware manufacturers), logical infrastructure and code (hosting\nJournal of Information Warfare\nPersistent Engagement and the Private Sector\nproviders, domain name registrars, software developers, application developers, and Internet service providers), and content (online content providers and search engines) (eSilva 2017).\nApplying generic understandings of the concepts of anticipatory resilience, defend forward, and contest reveals that many parts of the private sector are already persistently engaged in cyberspace. Some firms conduct activities akin to mission support units operating alongside government elements; others provide valuable tools and intelligence; still others are more like infrastructure developers and maintainers whose platforms are used to launch and conduct operations. The cumulative results of these activities are consistent with persistent engagement. Even though stovepipes exist between companies, there will still be a cumulative effect on the overall cyberspace environment just as individual, stove-piped firms' activities have a cumulative effect on the market.\nThe sectors complement one another in important ways. Private sector comparative advantages over their government partners include the ability to see inside U.S. commercial sector networks and gain unparalleled access and insight; they also have great access and visibility into foreign commercial infrastructure and networks. While the private sector has highly trained and extremely capable analysts and operators focused on cyber threats, many who are as capable if not more so than their government counterparts, DoD and intelligence communities maintain great numbers of highly trained analysts and operators who possess a strategic and operational perspective honed against the most capable adversaries. In fact, the most successful cybersecurity companies recruit heavily from U.S. and foreign government workforces. This provides the private sector with unique perspectives from a wider talent pool that is not easily accessible to the U.S. government.\nThere are also points of friction, such as how to weigh the intelligence operations trade-offs. From a public sector perspective, organisations charged with a national security mission, especially in the situational awareness space, closely guard access to ensure the continued flow of information and resulting insight. Private sector entities are more inclined to take actions to stop and/or prevent brand damage, intellectual property theft, and, most importantly, financial loss.\nFriction points will invariably remain but the operational approach of persistent engagement, oriented toward seizing and retaining initiative in competition, builds on the conceptual overlap that already exists between the U.S. government and private sector efforts to improve security and competitiveness in cyberspace. This foundation can be leveraged going forward and can drive recommendations for potential industrial policy changes involving both regulations and incentives so that persistent engagement can scale for the nation."

These new concepts reorient U.S. Cyber Command from a reactive response force to a proactive force with continuous engagement that operates outside U.S. military networks to discover and expose adversary activity as well as to execute actions before they harm U.S. national interests. Persistent engagement can form the basis for a whole-of-nation cyber strategy if the private sector is a central player, rather than an afterthought.",
