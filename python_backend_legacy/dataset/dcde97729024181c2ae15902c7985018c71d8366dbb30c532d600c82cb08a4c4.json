The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.\n\n# I. Introduction\n\n1. In the realm of modern digital interactions, envision yourself sitting at your computer, immersed in your daily routine when an email notification grabs your attention. The sender appears to be your trusted bank, urgently notifying you of an account issue and providing a link to rectify the situation. Intrigued and slightly concerned, you click on the link, inadvertently divulging your sensitive information on what turns out to be a fraudulent website. Unbeknownst to you, you have fallen victim to a shrewd cybercriminal tactic known as email phishing.\n\n2. This scenario of email phishing serves as a tangible example, one that resonates with countless individuals, of the pervasive nature of information and communication technology (ICT) threats. These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away. Thus, combating these modern perils necessitates a collaborative, global strategy that supersedes conventional territorial limits—a manifestation of how sovereignty has evolved in the digital age.",

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a surge in ICT utilization for remote operations, has accentuated the pivotal role of these technologies. While ICT empowers States, businesses, and individuals, its rapid advancement has also brought forth intricacies and concerns that ripple far beyond national frontiers. The interconnectedness facilitated by these technologies underscores the importance of grappling with the evolving concept of sovereignty, as we navigate an increasingly borderless digital landscape.\n\n4. “ICT threats” are malicious uses of ICTs perpetrated by both State and non-State actors with a significant impact on a variety of factors.¹ ICT threats can be divided into three categories. First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States.² It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system,³ might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited.⁴ The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals.⁵ The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism. This issue has the potential to threaten international safety and security.⁶\n\n5. Despite these issues, there is currently no special international legislation dealing with ICT risks, notably State-sponsored cyber threats. Thus far, the only efforts to address such government operations have involved the application of existing international law, including the prohibition on the use of\n\n1.

In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security.¹⁰ The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace.¹¹ Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace.¹² Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n\n6. Some regional laws address cyber-related issues. For example, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) initiated by the Council of Europe, regulates collaboration among parties in the protection of the community against cybercrime, by harmonizing domestic law, improving investigative procedures, and boosting cooperation among member States.¹³ The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection has not yet come into force.

In a narrower context, several international organizations have also come forward to acknowledge the current state of international law as applied to cyberspace. For example, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 73/266 supports the use of ICT for peaceful purposes, calls for the prevention of the conflict caused by ICT usage, and the provision of education on advancements in the field of ICTs in the context of international security.¹⁵ The European Union (EU) has examined and exchanged views on worldwide cyber security challenges; such efforts have expedited collaboration among EU member States, including diplomatic collaboration and the development of cyber diplomacy skills and an EU Cybersecurity Strategy.¹⁶ The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also adopted a crucial strategy document on 28 January 2021, the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025), which is intended to protect against cyberspace threats and assist the digital economy and community.¹⁷ This is only a strategy document and is not legally enforceable.\n\n8. This research article has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the nature of international law in cyberspace and how it impacts State sovereignty, leading to cross-border consequences. The second goal is to examine how the application of international law to cyberspace has contributed to the growth of cyberspace sovereignty.

This research article is structured into four primary sections. The initial section offers an overview of ICT threats and their interplay with international law, examining the existence of such threats, and their legal implications for States, and providing insights into international law within the cyberspace context. It examines principles such as State sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force within the cyberspace context. Subsequently, the following section highlights a critical concern—State sovereignty violation. It elucidates the key legal issues and relevant applicable laws. Moreover, the subsequent part delves into the intricate matter of extraterritorial effects in cyberspace, exploring the associated legal complexities and applicable legal frameworks. Lastly, the concluding section investigates the emerging realm of cyberspace sovereignty and its interaction with international law. By analyzing these multifaceted dimensions, this research aims to enhance comprehension of the evolving legal landscape within cyberspace and underscore the necessity for comprehensive international regulations.\n\n## II. Overview of ICT threats in international law\n\n10. This section presents an overview of the threats posed by ICT from the perspective of international law. The existence of ICT risks is becoming increasingly threatening. This section is divided into two subsections: (1) the existence of ICT risks and the legal effects on States and (2) international law in cyberspace. The first briefly highlights the nature of ICT threats and the risk they pose to international security and stability, economic and social growth, security, and individual well-being. The other subsection presents an overview of existing international law relevant to cyberspace as a foundation for how current international law might be applied to challenges posed by ICT threats.\n\n## II.A.

However, these concepts are not unique to the UK and the US; other nations also define and address them in their military doctrines. For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare.³¹ Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.³²\n\n20. In the UK military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the planning and synchronization of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of maneuver and to achieve military objectives.”³³ On the other hand, cyber-attacks are considered a subset of cyber operations and are described as “leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defense’s logistic capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life. As such, a cyberattack could have comparable effects to a physical attack.”³⁴ Similarly, in the US military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace”,³⁵ whereas cyber-attacks represent “actions taken in cyberspace that create noticeable denial effects (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) in cyberspace or\n\n30 Oona A.

The distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks is of utmost significance, as it delineates the varying intents and implications associated with these concepts. In the US military manual, cyber-attacks are regarded as akin to the use of force, thereby connecting them to the principle of self-defense under international law.37 This perspective suggests that cyber-attacks can potentially cause significant harm, prompting responses within the framework of traditional armed conflicts.38 However, it is important to note that this viewpoint is specific to the US, and not all States universally agree with this classification. Conversely, cyber operations encompass a broader spectrum of activities in cyberspace, covering not only offensive and defensive actions but also non-kinetic operations.39 These may include intelligence gathering, disruption of enemy communications, or the safeguarding of critical infrastructure. The broader definition of cyber operations underscores that not all activities in cyberspace are tantamount to cyber-attacks.\n\n22. Given the unique attributes of cyberspace, the distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks becomes even more complex. The fluidity and virtual nature of cyberspace blur traditional boundaries, making it challenging to pinpoint the location or source of certain actions.40 This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors, including State and non-State entities, to perpetrate cyber-attacks while concealing their identity and intent.41 The difficulty in attribution poses a significant challenge in terms of international legal frameworks and responses to cyber incidents.\n\n23.

States are increasingly recognizing the importance of bolstering their cyber capabilities and establishing robust cyber defense mechanisms.⁴² Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation and information-sharing to counter cyber threats collectively. However, divergent national perspectives and varying thresholds for response have led to debates about how to effectively regulate and govern cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n\n24. Various forms of cyber operations represent distinct levels of intrusion into computer networks and systems, making them essential factors in evaluating violations of State sovereignty. Among these cyber operations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and malware are prominent examples. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Such attacks do not necessarily breach the target’s network but can disrupt critical services and impact a nation’s ability to function effectively in cyberspace.⁴³ For example, the deployment of DDoS attacks against Estonia in 2007 had a tremendous impact on the country’s internet infrastructure.⁴⁴\n\n25. A cyber-attack is commonly defined as any activity aimed at degrading the functionality of a computer network for a political or national security objective.⁴⁵ This is evident in incidents that is previously mentioned when the Estonia fell victim to DDoS attacks, highlighting how cyber-attacks can intertwine political goal.⁴⁶ While the primary focus is on activities with political or national security objectives, it is important to acknowledge that cyber\n\n⁴² William Banks, Cyber Attribution and State Responsibility, 97 International Law Studies (2021), 1065; European Commission, Cyber: towards stronger EU capabilities for effective operational cooperation, solidarity and resilience, Press Release, 18 April 2023 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2243); Matt Kucik, How State and Local Governments Can Bolster their Cyber Defenses, Tenable, 24 May 2022 (https://pt-br.tenable.com/blog/how-state-and-local-governments-can-bolster-their-cyber-defenses).\n\n⁴³ U.

According to the Human Rights Council and GGE, “the same rights that States have offline must also be protected online”[64] and that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the UN, is applicable and is essential for ensuring peace and security in the online environment.”[65]\n\n37. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that the core concepts of international law, such as State sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention, apply equally to the cyber domain. Therefore, this section discusses three key principles of international law: the principle of State sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, and the principle of prohibition of the use of force.\n\n## II.B.i. Principle of State sovereignty\n\n38. Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory.[66] This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace.[67] It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters.[68] Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines.[69] It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders.[70] In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal.

There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.\n\n40. The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means.\n\n71 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n\n72 Ibid.; Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, Application of International Law to Cyberspace: Summary of Israel's Approach (25 October 2021) (https://embassies.gov.il/UnGeneva/prioritiesstatements/ScienceTechnologyDevelopment/Pages/Israel-approach-on-the-Application-of-International-Law-to-Cyberspace.aspx).\n\n73 Binxing Fang, Cyberspace Sovereignty: Reflections on Building a Community of Common Future in Cyberspace (2018), 78; UN Charter, art. 2, para.1; The German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, On the Application of International Law in Cyberspace (2021), 2-3; Michael N.

First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n\n42. Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78\n\n43. Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.\n\n44. To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported.\n\n75 Michael N.

The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law.⁸⁰ It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention.⁸¹ It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.\n\n46. Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives.⁸² Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions.⁸³ Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.⁸⁴\n\n47.

Intervention in cyberspace is another main priority of the GGE; the State should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. $^{88}$ According to the GGE report, States shall not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including using ICTs, in conformity with the principle of non-intervention. $^{89}$ The following considerations shape the use of the term \"coercion\" in non-intervention principles, and the term can be interpreted to describe a wide range of cyberspace activities.\n\n49.

In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States.\n\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n\n51. The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war.⁹¹ It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,⁹² it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations.\n\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that,\n\nin their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.⁹³\n\nThus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain⁹⁴ as they inherently cause harm in two distinct\n\n90 Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations as a Use of Force, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 297, 538.\n\n91 UN Charter, art. 2(4).\n\n92 Ibid.\n\n93 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(d).\n\n94 Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, above n.72; the German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, above n.73, 6; Foreign,",

While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties.⁹⁵ It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n\n52. Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains.⁹⁶ For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus⁹⁷ to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS).⁹⁸ The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges.⁹⁹ The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace.

Other scholars argue that the unique characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to apply the use of force principle in the same manner as in other domains. Rather, they claim that cyber operations that do not result in physical harm or loss of life are a type of coercion that falls short of force. A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force.¹⁰⁰ Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.¹⁰¹\n\n54. The use of ICT in the cyber domain, as stated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, arises from the fact that certain cyber activities can cause damage¹⁰² in two distinct ways.\n\n55. Firstly, traditional exercises of physical force typically involve the direct application of kinetic energy, resulting in visible and tangible destruction.¹⁰³ However, cyber operations can also cause significant harm and destruction through non-kinetic means, such as disrupting critical infrastructure, compromising sensitive data, and disabling essential services.¹⁰⁴ In the cyber domain, the use of force is not limited to physical impact but can manifest in various ways that may lead to severe consequences. For instance, cyberattacks targeting vital systems like power grids, financial institutions, or communication networks can disrupt the functioning of an entire nation, resulting in significant casualties and economic losses.¹⁰⁵\n\n100 Marco Roscini, above n.90, 299-301; Oliver Dörr, Use of Force, Prohibition of, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (2012), vol.

Second, cyber activities may have cascading effects, leading to a domino effect of disruptions and harm that extends far beyond the initial target.¹⁰⁶ For instance, a cyber operation aimed at disabling a country's military communication network could inadvertently impact civilian communication systems, compromising public safety and welfare.¹⁰⁷ The interconnected nature of digital infrastructure amplifies the potential damage and casualties resulting from cyber operations.¹⁰⁸\n\n57. The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and play an increasingly crucial role in international affairs, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable behavior and defining the thresholds for the use of force in the cyber domain remains a pressing challenge for the international community.\n\n58. A new interpretation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force may be needed to account for the features of cyberspace and guarantee the principle's application to this domain.¹⁰⁹ As previously stated, the anonymity of actors and the lack of physical damage in cyberspace make applying the conventional understanding of the use of force difficult. Furthermore, because there is no clear international consensus on how to define the use of force in the cyber domain, States may have differing views of what constitutes a use of force in the cyber domain.

Alternatively, new international rules specific to cyberspace may be required to solve the issues particular to that domain. For example, the Tallinn Manuals,¹¹⁰ which define new norms and principles of State behavior in cyberspace, might offer clarity on how existing international law relates to online environments. New international treaties or conventions addressing the use of force in cyberspace could offer a more complete and explicit framework to guide State behavior in this domain.\n\n60. To conclude, while the application of international law to cyberspace is a complicated and dynamic matter, there is growing consensus that existing law is relevant. There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty.

This discussion aims to analyze the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty, emphasizing their distinct scopes and implications, particularly in the context of cyber sovereignty and potential violations of State sovereignty.\n\n64.

The principle of non-intervention has been applied to address challenges such as cyber espionage and cyber assaults on State-controlled infrastructure.¹³¹ For example, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack has been deemed a violation of US sovereignty,¹³² illustrating how State sovereignty can be encroached upon in cyberspace and how international law can be employed to address such infringements.

Grounded in the principle of non-intervention, the US government responded by imposing sanctions on the DPRK and taking other measures to hold its government accountable.¹³³ Hacking identified here as a type of cyber intrusion, was attributed by the US government to the DPRK. The US response, including the imposition of penalties, can be seen as an effort to hold the country accountable for its actions and discourage future cyber intrusions. The actions taken by the US also convey a message to other nations that cross-border intrusions will not be tolerated and will be met with a response.\n\n73. The principle of jurisdiction is another way in which international law applies to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. The power of a State to exercise control over a certain area or individuals is referred to as jurisdiction.¹³⁴ Jurisdiction in cyberspace may be a complicated problem since it is not always apparent where a certain cyber-related action is taking place or who is liable for it.\n\n74. Several revisions and adaptations may be required for the successful application of international law to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.

Extraterritorial effects and international law\n\n76. Having explored the legal matters and relevant laws concerning violations of State sovereignty, another noteworthy aspect pertains to the impact of cyberspace, where multiple principles may come into play, causing cross-border implications. Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities.\n\n## IV.A. Extraterritorial effects: the legal issue\n\n77. The principle of extraterritoriality is addressed in the negative rather than the positive context. Typically, any legal action taken by a State impacts the region under its control. At times, the acts of one State may have an impact on the activities of another or within another territory and beyond its legislative jurisdiction.¹³⁹\n\n78.

The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location.¹⁴⁰ It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.¹⁴¹\n\n79. In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities. Cyber operations conducted by individuals or entities who are nationals of a particular State may have effects that extend beyond that State's borders, potentially impacting other States and their interests.¹⁴² This raises questions about the application of international law to such cyber operations and whether they may be considered extraterritorial.\n\n80. The nationality principle serves as a legal basis for States to assert jurisdiction over cyber activities conducted by their nationals, even if the effects of those activities are felt outside their territory.¹⁴³ This principle allows States to exercise their regulatory authority and apply their laws to address the potential harm caused by cyber operations carried out by their citizens abroad.¹⁴⁴ By doing so, the nationality principle helps mitigate the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities and provides a means for States to address cyber threats that originate from their nationals.\n\n81. In connection with the application of international law to cyberspace, the nationality principle can be relevant in determining which State has jurisdiction over specific cyber incidents and whether a State has the right to\n\n140 Kenneth S.

A State’s jurisdiction is typically established by its territorial boundaries in the physical world. However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace.¹⁴⁷ In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor.¹⁴⁸ Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach,¹⁴⁹ and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law.¹⁵⁰ The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects.\n\n145 Darrel C Menthe, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace: A Theory of International Spaces, 1 Michigan Telecommunications and Technology LR (1998), 71-73, 97-100.\n146 Ibid.; Maxron Holder, Cyberspace in a State of Flux: Regulating Cyberspace through International Law, 9(2) Groningen JIL (2022), 266, 273-274, 277.\n147 Michael N.

States have an obligation under international law to avoid interfering with the rights of other States and to compensate victims for their illegal conduct. Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.\n\n84. There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^[151]^\n\n85. The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.\n\n86. Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^[152]^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.\n\n87. In conclusion, the extraterritorial impacts of domestic law in cyberspace are increasingly complicated and have grown major implications for jurisdiction, State responsibility, extraterritorial application, and human rights.

Another example is the Stuxnet worm.¹⁵⁸ As mentioned above, the worm, identified in 2010, was developed to target and disrupt the control systems of industrial facilities, notably nuclear sites in Iran.¹⁵⁹ While the identity of the attacker is not explicitly stated, it is important to note that Iran has its perspective on the origin of the attack. The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities. International law is applicable to this incident, offering a framework for the extraterritorial effects of action in cyberspace. As previously stated, the UN Charter, especially the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality, prohibits States from asserting jurisdiction over another State’s territory without its consent.¹⁶⁰\n\n92.

Overcoming these limitations requires that the existing international legal framework for cyberspace be maintained and strengthened. This can be accomplished by negotiating new legally enforceable instruments, such as draft articles on State jurisdiction over cyber activities, or by developing soft law instruments, such as guidelines or recommendations.¹⁶² States should also continue to collaborate to build shared understandings and norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace; this can aid in clarifying the application of international law in this setting.\n\n## V.

The functioning of cyberspace does not rely upon a single ICT infrastructure in one territory; rather, it requires extensive cooperation and interconnection with other ICT infrastructures globally.¹⁷³ Cyberspace is a borderless and interconnected domain that operates across multiple jurisdictions, and its seamless functioning depends on the collaboration between different countries and their respective ICT systems. The Internet, as a core component of cyberspace, is a network of networks that spans the globe, and each network’s smooth operation is interdependent on the functioning of others.¹⁷⁴ This interconnection ensures data transfer, communication, and accessibility across borders, facilitating the exchange of information and services on a global scale.\n\n100.

A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n\n106. Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as\n\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).¹⁸⁷\n\nCyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.¹⁸⁸\n\n107. The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.\n\n108. Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace.

It is possible to argue that ICT threats may have consequences ranging from State sovereignty to cyberspace sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty in international law is significant because sovereignty in relation to territories, populations, and regimes inside its territory is relevant to cyberspace.\n\n110. In the context of cyber operations, the Three-Layer Internet Model aids in understanding the implications of different activities on State sovereignty.¹⁹¹ Low-level cyber operations, such as passive information gathering, may not necessarily violate sovereignty, as they do not involve significant intrusion or disruption.¹⁹² However, high-level cyber operations, like cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure or disinformation campaigns, can directly challenge a State's sovereignty by jeopardizing its ability to govern and protect its population.¹⁹³\n\n111. The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations.¹⁹⁴ Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain.

Sovereignty remains anchored in territorial control, jurisdiction extends beyond borders, and cyber sovereignty emerges as States grapple with regulating the virtual realm. Understanding the implications of different cyber operations on State sovereignty is crucial for crafting effective cyber policies and fostering international cooperation in the digital era. By incorporating the Three-Layer Internet Model, policymakers can navigate the complexities of cyberspace and strike a balance between safeguarding sovereignty and fostering an open and secure global Internet environment.\n\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n\n113. International law applies to cyberspace sovereignty in several ways, primarily. One of the primary means is through the principle of State sovereignty, which affirms the ability of States to govern and control their territory. This argument is used to explain States' regulation and control of the internet within their borders,¹⁹⁶ which includes the capacity to restrict or prohibit certain websites, manage online material, and respond to cyber threats emanating from within their borders.\n\n114. Another way international law applies to internet sovereignty is through the principle of non-intervention in other States' internal affairs.¹⁹⁷ This principle is employed to defend governments' capacity to respond to cyber threats that originate beyond their borders, such as through defensive cyber operations or the imposition of penalties against foreign entities.\n\n115.

Article 19 of the ICCPR preserves the right to free speech and prohibits arbitrary privacy infringements.²⁰⁰ These rights are directly relevant to cyberspace since they safeguard people’s capacity to access and distribute information online without intervention from authorities.²⁰¹ The ICCPR also acknowledges the right to peaceful assembly, which applies to online gatherings such as demonstrations and social media campaigns.²⁰² Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful intervention with privacy, which is directly relevant to cyberspace.²⁰³ The right to privacy includes the right to have personal data protected and is especially important in the internet environment, where massive amounts of personal data are gathered, kept, and shared.²⁰⁴\n\n117.

The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs.²⁰⁶ This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n\n118. The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime.²⁰⁷ Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders.²⁰⁸ The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software.²⁰⁹ This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence,²¹⁰ allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.\n\n119.

Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply.\n\n## VI. Conclusion\n\n121. In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.\n\n122. The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.\n\n123. The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain.

Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.\n\n125. While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked.\n\n²¹² Michael N.

Cyber-attacks targeting key infrastructure can undermine sovereignty by aiding another State's territorial control. The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.\n# I. Introduction\n1. In the realm of modern digital interactions, envision yourself sitting at your computer, immersed in your daily routine when an email notification grabs your attention. The sender appears to be your trusted bank, urgently notifying you of an account issue and providing a link to rectify the situation. Intrigued and slightly concerned, you click on the link, inadvertently divulging your sensitive information on what turns out to be a fraudulent website. Unbeknownst to you, you have fallen victim to a shrewd cybercriminal tactic known as email phishing.\n2. This scenario of email phishing serves as a tangible example, one that resonates with countless individuals, of the pervasive nature of information and communication technology (ICT) threats. These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away. Thus, combating these modern perils necessitates a collaborative, global strategy that supersedes conventional territorial limits—a manifestation of how sovereignty has evolved in the digital age.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 27\n3. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a surge in ICT utilization for remote operations, has accentuated the pivotal role of these technologies. While ICT empowers States, businesses, and individuals, its rapid advancement has also brought forth intricacies and concerns that ripple far beyond national frontiers. The interconnectedness facilitated by these technologies underscores the importance of grappling with the evolving concept of sovereignty, as we navigate an increasingly borderless digital landscape.\n4. “ICT threats” are malicious uses of ICTs perpetrated by both State and non-State actors with a significant impact on a variety of factors.¹ ICT threats can be divided into three categories. First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States.² It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system,³ might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited.⁴ The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals.⁵ The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism. This issue has the potential to threaten international safety and security.⁶\n5. Despite these issues, there is currently no special international legislation dealing with ICT risks, notably State-sponsored cyber threats. Thus far, the only efforts to address such government operations have involved the application of existing international law, including the prohibition on the use of\n1.

In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security.¹⁰ The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace.¹¹ Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace.¹² Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n6. Some regional laws address cyber-related issues. For example, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) initiated by the Council of Europe, regulates collaboration among parties in the protection of the community against cybercrime, by harmonizing domestic law, improving investigative procedures, and boosting cooperation among member States.¹³ The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection has not yet come into force. It aims to establish a credible framework for cybersecurity in Africa by organizing electronic transactions, protecting personal data, promoting cybersecurity, e-governance and combating cybercrime.¹⁴\n7 UN Charter, art. 2(4).\n8 UN HRC, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (16 July 2012), UN Doc.

In a narrower context, several international organizations have also come forward to acknowledge the current state of international law as applied to cyberspace. For example, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 73/266 supports the use of ICT for peaceful purposes, calls for the prevention of the conflict caused by ICT usage, and the provision of education on advancements in the field of ICTs in the context of international security.¹⁵ The European Union (EU) has examined and exchanged views on worldwide cyber security challenges; such efforts have expedited collaboration among EU member States, including diplomatic collaboration and the development of cyber diplomacy skills and an EU Cybersecurity Strategy.¹⁶ The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also adopted a crucial strategy document on 28 January 2021, the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025), which is intended to protect against cyberspace threats and assist the digital economy and community.¹⁷ This is only a strategy document and is not legally enforceable.\n8. This research article has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the nature of international law in cyberspace and how it impacts State sovereignty, leading to cross-border consequences. The second goal is to examine how the application of international law to cyberspace has contributed to the growth of cyberspace sovereignty. It seeks to address three key questions: First, do non-physical ICT threats violate the sovereignty of other States? If so, to what extent does current international law apply to such threats? Second, can domestic cyberspace laws have cross-border effects, and to what\nPure Sovereignty in Cyberspace, 5 February 2024 (https://opiniojuris.org/2024/02/05/the-african-union-rightly-endorses-pure-sovereignty-in-cyberspace/).\n15 UN General Assembly, Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 22 December 2018: Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (2 January 2019), UN Doc.

And third, does the principle of cyberspace sovereignty exist, and how does it compare to the principle of territorial sovereignty?\n9. This research article is structured into four primary sections. The initial section offers an overview of ICT threats and their interplay with international law, examining the existence of such threats, and their legal implications for States, and providing insights into international law within the cyberspace context. It examines principles such as State sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force within the cyberspace context. Subsequently, the following section highlights a critical concern—State sovereignty violation. It elucidates the key legal issues and relevant applicable laws. Moreover, the subsequent part delves into the intricate matter of extraterritorial effects in cyberspace, exploring the associated legal complexities and applicable legal frameworks. Lastly, the concluding section investigates the emerging realm of cyberspace sovereignty and its interaction with international law. By analyzing these multifaceted dimensions, this research aims to enhance comprehension of the evolving legal landscape within cyberspace and underscore the necessity for comprehensive international regulations.\n## II. Overview of ICT threats in international law\n10. This section presents an overview of the threats posed by ICT from the perspective of international law. The existence of ICT risks is becoming increasingly threatening. This section is divided into two subsections: (1) the existence of ICT risks and the legal effects on States and (2) international law in cyberspace. The first briefly highlights the nature of ICT threats and the risk they pose to international security and stability, economic and social growth, security, and individual well-being. The other subsection presents an overview of existing international law relevant to cyberspace as a foundation for how current international law might be applied to challenges posed by ICT threats.\n## II.A. Existence of ICT threats and legal effects on States\n11. The challenges of addressing ICT threats are not new and have received considerable attention. The GGE on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security was established in 2011 to assess actual and prospective dangers, and to address issues of ICT use impacting the international community and the\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 31\nrisks that it may be used in a manner inconsistent with the preservation of international stability and security.¹⁸ This would gravely jeopardize the integrity of the State and individual infrastructure. Following that, additional meetings were conducted to address the existence of ICT dangers,¹⁹ which may be described as follows.\n12. The malicious use of ICT presents a complex and evolving challenge, encompassing cyberattacks, data breaches and other cyber threats that transcend borders and undermine State sovereignty.²⁰ Beyond immediate material harm, these activities have far-reaching societal, economic, and geopolitical consequences, necessitating a comprehensive response that combines technical solutions, legal frameworks, and international cooperation.²¹ Addressing malicious ICT use requires ongoing innovation and collaboration to ensure a secure digital environment for individuals, businesses, and governments.\n13. ICT threats, broadly defined as the intentional and malicious use of information technology, which can be orchestrated by State or non-State actors. The characterization of activities as ICT threats may vary geographically, yet their consequences have global implications.²² However, the classification of activities as ICT threats necessitates adherence to specific criteria.\n18 UNGA Res 66/24 (2 December 2011) Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Doc.

Characteristics of malicious ICT usage may appear in many circumstances, for example, ICT is used aggressively to achieve military goals.²⁵ This form of ICT activity has the potential to be utilized as a tool or weapon in future wars between States.\n15. Second, such acts may be used to wage abusive information campaigns²⁶ to impact the processes, systems, and general stability of other States and may directly or indirectly impact individuals.\n16. Third, ICT activities can cause harm to essential infrastructure supporting services at the national, regional, or international levels.²⁷ The critical information infrastructure targeted and subject to critical assaults includes essential public services, especially critical technological infrastructure on the internet, and businesses in the health sector. Information concerning a person's health is highly sensitive and vulnerable, as has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.²⁸\n17. Fourth, ICT might be employed for terrorist reasons.²⁹ Such actions might involve the direct use of ICT for terrorism or troop allocation. The use of ICT to provide financial assistance, training, and promotion and the act of assaulting ICT infrastructure are all examples of unlawful ICT usage.\n18. Misuse of ICT can be classified according to the technique, procedure, and method employed; for example, cyber-attack, cyber espionage, cybercrime, or cyberterrorism all constitute forms of misuse. However, this article does not go into detail regarding each category and only a brief overview of these ICT threats is provided.\n19. In the realm of modern warfare and national security, the terminologies of cyber operations and cyber-attacks have gained prominence in military\n23 Ibid., para.8.\n24 Ibid., para.9.\n25 GGE 2015 Report, above n.19, para.4.\n26 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.9.\n27 Ibid., para.10.\n28 Ibid.\n29 Ibid., para.13.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 33\nmanuals of various States,³⁰ including the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). However, these concepts are not unique to the UK and the US; other nations also define and address them in their military doctrines. For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare.³¹ Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.³²\n20. In the UK military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the planning and synchronization of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of maneuver and to achieve military objectives.”³³ On the other hand, cyber-attacks are considered a subset of cyber operations and are described as “leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defense’s logistic capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life. As such, a cyberattack could have comparable effects to a physical attack.”³⁴ Similarly, in the US military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace”,³⁵ whereas cyber-attacks represent “actions taken in cyberspace that create noticeable denial effects (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) in cyberspace or\n30 Oona A.

The distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks is of utmost significance, as it delineates the varying intents and implications associated with these concepts. In the US military manual, cyber-attacks are regarded as akin to the use of force, thereby connecting them to the principle of self-defense under international law.37 This perspective suggests that cyber-attacks can potentially cause significant harm, prompting responses within the framework of traditional armed conflicts.38 However, it is important to note that this viewpoint is specific to the US, and not all States universally agree with this classification. Conversely, cyber operations encompass a broader spectrum of activities in cyberspace, covering not only offensive and defensive actions but also non-kinetic operations.39 These may include intelligence gathering, disruption of enemy communications, or the safeguarding of critical infrastructure. The broader definition of cyber operations underscores that not all activities in cyberspace are tantamount to cyber-attacks.\n22. Given the unique attributes of cyberspace, the distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks becomes even more complex. The fluidity and virtual nature of cyberspace blur traditional boundaries, making it challenging to pinpoint the location or source of certain actions.40 This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors, including State and non-State entities, to perpetrate cyber-attacks while concealing their identity and intent.41 The difficulty in attribution poses a significant challenge in terms of international legal frameworks and responses to cyber incidents.\n23. The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates the development of comprehensive strategies to address the nuances of cyber operations and\n36 Ibid.\n37 Ibid., 2-15; James E McGhee, Cyber Redux: The Schmitt Analysis, Tallinn Manual and US Cyber Policy, 2(1) Journal of Law &amp; Cyber Warfare (2013), 64-70; Miranda Grange, Cyber Warfare and the Law of Armed Conflict (2014), 9-10.\n38 Neil S.

States are increasingly recognizing the importance of bolstering their cyber capabilities and establishing robust cyber defense mechanisms.⁴² Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation and information-sharing to counter cyber threats collectively. However, divergent national perspectives and varying thresholds for response have led to debates about how to effectively regulate and govern cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n24. Various forms of cyber operations represent distinct levels of intrusion into computer networks and systems, making them essential factors in evaluating violations of State sovereignty. Among these cyber operations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and malware are prominent examples. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Such attacks do not necessarily breach the target’s network but can disrupt critical services and impact a nation’s ability to function effectively in cyberspace.⁴³ For example, the deployment of DDoS attacks against Estonia in 2007 had a tremendous impact on the country’s internet infrastructure.⁴⁴\n25. A cyber-attack is commonly defined as any activity aimed at degrading the functionality of a computer network for a political or national security objective.⁴⁵ This is evident in incidents that is previously mentioned when the Estonia fell victim to DDoS attacks, highlighting how cyber-attacks can intertwine political goal.⁴⁶ While the primary focus is on activities with political or national security objectives, it is important to acknowledge that cyber\n⁴² William Banks, Cyber Attribution and State Responsibility, 97 International Law Studies (2021), 1065; European Commission, Cyber: towards stronger EU capabilities for effective operational cooperation, solidarity and resilience, Press Release, 18 April 2023 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2243); Matt Kucik, How State and Local Governments Can Bolster their Cyber Defenses, Tenable, 24 May 2022 (https://pt-br.tenable.com/blog/how-state-and-local-governments-can-bolster-their-cyber-defenses).\n⁴³ U.

Singer and Allan Friedman, ibid., 125.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nactivities may serve various purposes, extending beyond political motivations. The term “cyber operations” could serve as a more encompassing umbrella, covering a range of activities in cyberspace, from intelligence gathering to disruptive operations. The absence of a uniform cluster-definition in international law to differentiate between these activities highlights a challenge, and the regulation of such activities may require a detailed and careful approach, accounting for the diversity of cyber operations.\n26. Malware, on the other hand, refers to malicious software designed to infiltrate and compromise computer systems.⁴⁷ It can range from ransomware, which encrypts valuable data until a ransom is paid, to advanced persistent threats (APTs) capable of clandestinely maintaining long-term access to targeted systems.⁴⁸ These forms of cyber operations pose significant challenges to the affected States, as they can lead to data breaches, economic losses, and even the manipulation of critical infrastructure.\n27. Recent cyber incidents have demonstrated the varying degrees of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. The 2020 SolarWinds attack, a sophisticated supply-chain compromise, involved the insertion of a backdoor into the software update of SolarWinds, a widely used IT management tool. The attackers targeted various government and private organizations, including sensitive government agencies, marking a high level of intrusion into critical systems.⁴⁹\n⁴⁷ What is malware?: Malware or malicious software definition, Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware); What is malware?, CISCO (https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/what-is-malware.html).\n⁴⁸ What is an APT, Imperva (https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/apt-advanced-persistent-threat/); Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Attacks’, Cynet (https://www.cynet.com/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-attacks/).\n⁴⁹ Saheed Oladimeji and Sean Michael Kerner, SolarWinds hack explained: Everything you need to know, TechTarget, 2023 (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know); Isabella Jibilian and Katie Canales, The US is readying sanctions against Russia over the SolarWinds cyber attack.

Similarly, the interference in the 2016 US presidential election revealed the potential for cyber operations to influence political processes.⁵⁰ State-sponsored actors leveraged phishing attacks to gain access to political organizations' networks, stole sensitive data, and conducted disinformation campaigns.⁵¹ This intrusion highlighted the impact of cyber operations on a nation's democratic processes and raised concerns about safeguarding sovereignty and electoral integrity.⁵²\n29. These examples underscore the significance of understanding the varying levels of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. Assessing the violation of State sovereignty in cyberspace necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the techniques, tools, and intentions behind cyber operations. Moreover, international cooperation and robust cybersecurity measures are imperative to safeguard States from cyber threats that have the potential to disrupt vital functions, compromise national security, and infringe upon sovereignty.\n30. Cyber espionage may take several forms. It can be physical, for example, where code is placed into hardware to restrict access from a stream, or it might rely on cable channels. It might leverage the spread of malware to control communication flows or take a more sophisticated form, such as phishing, to acquire access and modify data.⁵³\n31.

The first and most important legal impact concerns State sovereignty.⁵⁸ The action constituting an ICT threat differs in nature from conventional actions or omissions such as the use of the military to violate the territorial integrity of other States by deploying weapons, or interfering with or influencing politics.

It might take the shape of internet acts involving acts outside the State.\n34. Despite the absence of physical intrusion, cyber-attacks can influence the State,⁵⁹ raising questions about their classification under traditional international law concepts like Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Assessing the effectiveness of a weapon, including cyber-attacks, may involve considering the harm caused.⁶⁰ Furthermore, ICT misuse could amount to intervention in the internal affairs of other States,⁶¹ invoking the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, which are foundational in international law.\n35. The complexities surrounding the integration of international law into cyberspace constitute a dynamic challenge that has recently attracted the interest of scholars, policymakers, and practitioners.⁶² One of the most challenging aspects of applying international law to cyberspace is that it is a virtual rather than a physical domain.⁶³ The anonymity and transnational character of cyberspace operations make it difficult to place responsibility for cyber incidents on individual participants.\n⁵⁹ Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace: Sovereignty Redux?, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 22-23.\n⁶⁰ Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 11; Corfu Channel, Separate Opinion of Judge Alvarez, ICJ Reports 1949, 43; Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970 containing the Declaration of Principles of International Law, Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, UN Doc.

Despite these challenges, experts and practitioners are increasingly in agreement that existing international law applies to cyberspace. According to the Human Rights Council and GGE, “the same rights that States have offline must also be protected online”[64] and that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the UN, is applicable and is essential for ensuring peace and security in the online environment.”[65]\n37. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that the core concepts of international law, such as State sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention, apply equally to the cyber domain. Therefore, this section discusses three key principles of international law: the principle of State sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, and the principle of prohibition of the use of force.\n## II.B.i. Principle of State sovereignty\n38. Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory.[66] This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace.[67] It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters.[68] Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines.[69] It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders.[70] In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal. Thus, differentiating sovereignty and jurisdiction holds key\n64 UN General Assembly, above n.8, 2; UN HRC, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (Human Rights Council, 14 July 2014), UN Doc.

There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.\n40. The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means.\n71 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n72 Ibid.; Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, Application of International Law to Cyberspace: Summary of Israel's Approach (25 October 2021) (https://embassies.gov.il/UnGeneva/prioritiesstatements/ScienceTechnologyDevelopment/Pages/Israel-approach-on-the-Application-of-International-Law-to-Cyberspace.aspx).\n73 Binxing Fang, Cyberspace Sovereignty: Reflections on Building a Community of Common Future in Cyberspace (2018), 78; UN Charter, art. 2, para.1; The German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, On the Application of International Law in Cyberspace (2021), 2-3; Michael N.

First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n42. Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78\n43. Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.\n44. To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported.\n75 Michael N.

The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law.⁸⁰ It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention.⁸¹ It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.\n46. Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives.⁸² Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions.⁸³ Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.⁸⁴\n47. Coercion, however, extends beyond mere pressure by involving threats or forceful actions that limit a State’s choices and significantly reduce its\n80 Malcolm N.

Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. $^{86}$ Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. $^{87}$\n48. Intervention in cyberspace is another main priority of the GGE; the State should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. $^{88}$ According to the GGE report, States shall not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including using ICTs, in conformity with the principle of non-intervention. $^{89}$ The following considerations shape the use of the term \"coercion\" in non-intervention principles, and the term can be interpreted to describe a wide range of cyberspace activities.\n49. Furthermore, States must respect the sovereignty of other States by refraining from cyber activities that might violate another State's territorial\n85 William Michael Reisman, Criteria for the Lawful Use of Force in International Law, 10 Yale JIL (1985), 279-285; Tom J.

In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States.\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n51. The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war.⁹¹ It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,⁹² it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations.\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that,\nin their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.⁹³\nThus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain⁹⁴ as they inherently cause harm in two distinct\n90 Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations as a Use of Force, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 297, 538.\n91 UN Charter, art. 2(4).\n92 Ibid.\n93 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(d).\n94 Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, above n.72; the German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, above n.73, 6; Foreign,\nChinese JIL (2024)\nways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties.⁹⁵ It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n52. Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains.⁹⁶ For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus⁹⁷ to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS).⁹⁸ The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges.⁹⁹ The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace. It also emphasizes the importance of States developing norms and legislation for responsible State behavior in that realm.\nCommonwealth &amp; Development Office, Application of international law to states’ conduct in cyberspace: UK statement (UK: Policy Paper, 3 June 2021) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement); HM Government, National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021 (2016) (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf).\n⁹⁵ Michael N.

Other scholars argue that the unique characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to apply the use of force principle in the same manner as in other domains. Rather, they claim that cyber operations that do not result in physical harm or loss of life are a type of coercion that falls short of force. A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force.¹⁰⁰ Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.¹⁰¹\n54. The use of ICT in the cyber domain, as stated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, arises from the fact that certain cyber activities can cause damage¹⁰² in two distinct ways.\n55. Firstly, traditional exercises of physical force typically involve the direct application of kinetic energy, resulting in visible and tangible destruction.¹⁰³ However, cyber operations can also cause significant harm and destruction through non-kinetic means, such as disrupting critical infrastructure, compromising sensitive data, and disabling essential services.¹⁰⁴ In the cyber domain, the use of force is not limited to physical impact but can manifest in various ways that may lead to severe consequences. For instance, cyberattacks targeting vital systems like power grids, financial institutions, or communication networks can disrupt the functioning of an entire nation, resulting in significant casualties and economic losses.¹⁰⁵\n100 Marco Roscini, above n.90, 299-301; Oliver Dörr, Use of Force, Prohibition of, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (2012), vol.

Second, cyber activities may have cascading effects, leading to a domino effect of disruptions and harm that extends far beyond the initial target.¹⁰⁶ For instance, a cyber operation aimed at disabling a country's military communication network could inadvertently impact civilian communication systems, compromising public safety and welfare.¹⁰⁷ The interconnected nature of digital infrastructure amplifies the potential damage and casualties resulting from cyber operations.¹⁰⁸\n57. The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and play an increasingly crucial role in international affairs, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable behavior and defining the thresholds for the use of force in the cyber domain remains a pressing challenge for the international community.\n58. A new interpretation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force may be needed to account for the features of cyberspace and guarantee the principle's application to this domain.¹⁰⁹ As previously stated, the anonymity of actors and the lack of physical damage in cyberspace make applying the conventional understanding of the use of force difficult. Furthermore, because there is no clear international consensus on how to define the use of force in the cyber domain, States may have differing views of what constitutes a use of force in the cyber domain. A new interpretation of the use of force\nindustry compare when it comes to the financial loss exposure of cyber threats?

Alternatively, new international rules specific to cyberspace may be required to solve the issues particular to that domain. For example, the Tallinn Manuals,¹¹⁰ which define new norms and principles of State behavior in cyberspace, might offer clarity on how existing international law relates to online environments. New international treaties or conventions addressing the use of force in cyberspace could offer a more complete and explicit framework to guide State behavior in this domain.\n60. To conclude, while the application of international law to cyberspace is a complicated and dynamic matter, there is growing consensus that existing law is relevant. There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty. Furthermore, the ongoing debate over the use of force in cyberspace highlights the need for additional clarity and legal frameworks to control State behavior in this sphere.\n61. Other international law not addressed in this article includes the principle of State responsibility,¹¹¹ international human rights¹¹² and humanitarian law.¹¹³ For the sake of being concise, this section does not address these in any depth.\n## III. State sovereignty violation and international law\n62. The legal complexities in the cyberspace domain can be examined through diverse lenses, shaped by the application of laws to actions occurring within this digital realm. This section delves into pivotal issues encompassing the modern enforcement of international law in the cyberspace arena, commencing with the breach of State sovereignty and the pertinent questions\n110 Michael N.

State sovereignty violation: the legal issue\n63. While jurisdiction is a vital component of sovereignty, it is not always territorially bound.¹¹⁴ In the context of cyberspace, where borders become blurred and the virtual world extends beyond physical boundaries, a clear distinction between these two principles becomes crucial. This discussion aims to analyze the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty, emphasizing their distinct scopes and implications, particularly in the context of cyber sovereignty and potential violations of State sovereignty.\n64. Sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international law that requires States to employ and restrict the extent of their activities within their sovereign territory while not infringing on the sovereignty of other States.¹¹⁵ The notion of “territory” is legal and political and applies to geographical or physical areas.¹¹⁶ The scope of any State’s sovereignty in respect of its territory may be enlarged to cover regions that, while not geographical or physical, have a legal component.¹¹⁷\n114 Joseph H.

Given the present international rules applicable to cyberspace, the unlawful use of ICT can infringe on other States' sovereignty. One significant issue for international law's applicability to cyberspace is whether it can be enforced within a State's territory.\n66. The GGE study recognized that international law is applicable, maintaining that the UN Charter and the principle of State sovereignty can be applied in cyberspace. The Group reaffirms that\nState sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by states of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory. Existing obligations under international law are applicable to states' ICT-related activity.^[118]^\nThis demonstrates that ICT-related acts, even when not undertaken on another State's territory, can infringe on another State's sovereignty. States may exercise sovereignty by exerting their authority in cyber structures located in their territory over persons, including citizens of other States, residing in their sovereign area.^[119]^\n67. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State's capacity to govern activities within its cyberspace borders, including the regulation and control of information flow, data privacy, and cybersecurity.^[120]^ As Yochai Benkler notes in the article \"From Consumers to Users\", cyberspace can be divided into three layers—physical infrastructure, logical infrastructure, and content and application layers.^[121]^ Cyber sovereignty involves a State's ability to assert control\n^[118]^ GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n^[119]^ Google Spain SL v.

The scope of cyber sovereignty encompasses not only territorial jurisdiction but also extraterritorial jurisdiction based on the effects principle.¹²³ States can assert jurisdiction over cyber activities that have direct and substantial effects within their borders, regardless of where the actions originated.¹²⁴\n69. Violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace occur when one State conducts cyber operations or cyber-attacks that undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of another State.¹²⁵ Such violations may involve cyber espionage, data breaches, or cyber warfare, targeting a State's critical infrastructure, government systems, or sensitive information.¹²⁶\n70. The legal implications and scope of using sovereignty in cyberspace should be limited. States have sovereignty over information and communications technology infrastructure within their territory, according to the founding concept of sovereignty.¹²⁷ An essential consideration is that the use of sovereignty must not infringe on the sovereignty of another State. This means that the use of ICTs must not jeopardize other States' cyberinfrastructure.¹²⁸\n122 Ibid.\n123 Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 17-18; Hao Yeli, A Three-Perspective Theory of Cyber Sovereignty, 7 (2) PRISM (2017), 109-115; Florian Kriener, Cyber Space, Sovereignty and the Intricacies of International Law-Making: Reflections on Germany's Position Paper on International Law in Cyberspace (Völkerrechtsblog, 16 April 2021) (https://voelkerrechtsblog.org/cyber-space-sovereignty-and-the-intricacies-of-international-law-making/).\n124 Harriet Moynihan, ibid., 21-24.\n125 Ibid., 4-5, 15-24; A.

State sovereignty violation: applicable law\n71. There is an increasing need for an international legal framework to address these challenges since traditional forms of State sovereignty are no longer adequate to meet the international character of cyberspace. The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States is one of the keyways that international law is applied to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.¹³⁰\n72. The principle of non-intervention has been applied to address challenges such as cyber espionage and cyber assaults on State-controlled infrastructure.¹³¹ For example, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack has been deemed a violation of US sovereignty,¹³² illustrating how State sovereignty can be encroached upon in cyberspace and how international law can be employed to address such infringements. The US government attributed the attack to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), leading to the\n¹²⁹ Finland, ibid., 2; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Grounded in the principle of non-intervention, the US government responded by imposing sanctions on the DPRK and taking other measures to hold its government accountable.¹³³ Hacking identified here as a type of cyber intrusion, was attributed by the US government to the DPRK. The US response, including the imposition of penalties, can be seen as an effort to hold the country accountable for its actions and discourage future cyber intrusions. The actions taken by the US also convey a message to other nations that cross-border intrusions will not be tolerated and will be met with a response.\n73. The principle of jurisdiction is another way in which international law applies to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. The power of a State to exercise control over a certain area or individuals is referred to as jurisdiction.¹³⁴ Jurisdiction in cyberspace may be a complicated problem since it is not always apparent where a certain cyber-related action is taking place or who is liable for it.\n74. Several revisions and adaptations may be required for the successful application of international law to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. One possible modification would be to explain the application to cyber activities of existing norms of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention. This modification could include the development of new legal interpretations or more detailed guidance on how these principles should be implemented in the context of cyberspace.¹³⁵ Another adaptation would be to create new legal tools or soft instruments that explicitly handle violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.¹³⁶ A new legally binding document on State sovereignty in cyberspace could be developed by the relevant UN entities to set out explicit norms and principles for the safeguarding of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n75. International law should address the problem of attribution and responsibility or violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.¹³⁷ Attribution,\n¹³³ Ibid.\n¹³⁴ Michael N.

Extraterritorial effects and international law\n76. Having explored the legal matters and relevant laws concerning violations of State sovereignty, another noteworthy aspect pertains to the impact of cyberspace, where multiple principles may come into play, causing cross-border implications. Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities.\n## IV.A. Extraterritorial effects: the legal issue\n77. The principle of extraterritoriality is addressed in the negative rather than the positive context. Typically, any legal action taken by a State impacts the region under its control. At times, the acts of one State may have an impact on the activities of another or within another territory and beyond its legislative jurisdiction.¹³⁹\n78. The question of jurisdiction is a critical one. One of the interesting types of core principles related to extraterritorial effects is the nationality\nWrongful Acts 2001, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, vol. II (part Two), A/56/49 (Vol. I)/Corr.4.\n138 Constantine Antonopoulos, ibid., 115-119; André Nollkaemper and Dov Jacobs, Shared Responsibility in International law: A Conceptual Framework, 34 Michigan JIL (2013), 359; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Legal and Technical Approaches and Challenges, 31 EJIL (2020), 953-955.\n139 Hannah L. Buxbaum, The Practice(s) of Extraterritoriality, in: Hannah L. Buxbaum and Thibaut Fleury Graff (eds.), Extraterritoriality (2022), 3.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nprinciple. The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location.¹⁴⁰ It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.¹⁴¹\n79. In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities. Cyber operations conducted by individuals or entities who are nationals of a particular State may have effects that extend beyond that State's borders, potentially impacting other States and their interests.¹⁴² This raises questions about the application of international law to such cyber operations and whether they may be considered extraterritorial.\n80. The nationality principle serves as a legal basis for States to assert jurisdiction over cyber activities conducted by their nationals, even if the effects of those activities are felt outside their territory.¹⁴³ This principle allows States to exercise their regulatory authority and apply their laws to address the potential harm caused by cyber operations carried out by their citizens abroad.¹⁴⁴ By doing so, the nationality principle helps mitigate the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities and provides a means for States to address cyber threats that originate from their nationals.\n81. In connection with the application of international law to cyberspace, the nationality principle can be relevant in determining which State has jurisdiction over specific cyber incidents and whether a State has the right to\n140 Kenneth S. Gallant, The Nationality Principle, in: Kenneth S. Gallant (ed.), International Criminal Jurisdiction (2022), 345-348.\n141 Carol A.

A State’s jurisdiction is typically established by its territorial boundaries in the physical world. However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace.¹⁴⁷ In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor.¹⁴⁸ Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach,¹⁴⁹ and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law.¹⁵⁰ The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects.\n145 Darrel C Menthe, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace: A Theory of International Spaces, 1 Michigan Telecommunications and Technology LR (1998), 71-73, 97-100.\n146 Ibid.; Maxron Holder, Cyberspace in a State of Flux: Regulating Cyberspace through International Law, 9(2) Groningen JIL (2022), 266, 273-274, 277.\n147 Michael N.

Belgium), ICJ Reports 2002, 10-11.\nChinese JIL (2024)\n83. Another facet of international law's extraterritorial effects in cyberspace concerns the issue of State responsibility. States have an obligation under international law to avoid interfering with the rights of other States and to compensate victims for their illegal conduct. Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.\n84. There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^[151]^\n85. The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.\n86. Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^[152]^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.\n87. In conclusion, the extraterritorial impacts of domestic law in cyberspace are increasingly complicated and have grown major implications for jurisdiction, State responsibility, extraterritorial application, and human rights. While legal academics and practitioners continue to argue the optimal\n^[151]^ Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, above n.75, 154-158 and 165-167.\n^[152]^ Mireille Hildebrandt, *Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to Enforce in Cyberspace?

Many international and regional legislation, policies, and recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.\n## IV.B. Extraterritorial effects: applicable law\n88. Extraterritorial effects in cyberspace have expanded in recent years, as the internet and other digital technologies have enabled individuals and non-State entities to operate beyond national borders.^[153]^ There is an increasing need for international legal frameworks to handle these challenges, as traditional notions of State sovereignty may no longer be adequate, given the global nature of cyberspace.\n89. There are several examples of international law being used to address extraterritorial effects in cyberspace.\n90. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017 is one example of the use of international law.^[154]^ The attack disrupted hospitals, businesses, and government agencies in over 150 countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers. Many States and cybersecurity experts blamed the hack on the DPRK's government.^[155]^ The UN Security Council (UNSC) has passed several resolutions and issued statements on cyber security and international law, including UNSC Resolution 2341 (2017), which recognizes\n153 Hannah L.

Another example is the Stuxnet worm.¹⁵⁸ As mentioned above, the worm, identified in 2010, was developed to target and disrupt the control systems of industrial facilities, notably nuclear sites in Iran.¹⁵⁹ While the identity of the attacker is not explicitly stated, it is important to note that Iran has its perspective on the origin of the attack. The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities. International law is applicable to this incident, offering a framework for the extraterritorial effects of action in cyberspace. As previously stated, the UN Charter, especially the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality, prohibits States from asserting jurisdiction over another State’s territory without its consent.¹⁶⁰\n92. The existing international legal system provides a framework for dealing with extraterritoriality in cyberspace, but it is not without constraints.

A State’s reaction to extraterritorial impacts like cyber espionage and cyber-attacks might also be hampered by a lack of agreement on how to interpret and implement international law in cyberspace.\n93. Overcoming these limitations requires that the existing international legal framework for cyberspace be maintained and strengthened. This can be accomplished by negotiating new legally enforceable instruments, such as draft articles on State jurisdiction over cyber activities, or by developing soft law instruments, such as guidelines or recommendations.¹⁶² States should also continue to collaborate to build shared understandings and norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace; this can aid in clarifying the application of international law in this setting.\n## V. Cyberspace sovereignty and international law\n94. This section represents the core legal concern pertaining to the applicability of international law in the realm of cyberspace. It explores the progressive matter of cyberspace sovereignty, a subject that is infrequently examined within a broader framework. Within this section, the notion of cyberspace sovereignty is introduced, along with its associated legal intricacies, while also addressing how international law could potentially be relevant in navigating this novel domain of sovereignty.\n## V.A. Cyberspace sovereignty: the legal issue\n95. Sovereignty is traditionally understood as a territorial concept,¹⁶³ entailing a State’s exclusive control over its territory, populace, and domestic affairs.¹⁶⁴ On the other hand, jurisdiction expands beyond territorial borders\n---\n162 Marco Roscini, above n.90, 307-308; Katharina Ziolkowski, above n.109, 135, 174; Michael N.

Sovereignty, rooted in the Westphalian system, is the bedrock of international law, emphasizing a State’s exclusive control within its territorial boundaries.¹⁶⁶ It entails the supreme authority of a State over its domestic affairs, encompassing governance, laws, and enforcement mechanisms. Traditionally, sovereignty was a territorial concept, asserting that a State has the right to govern its territory and protect its national interests.¹⁶⁷\n97. Yochai Benkler’s Three-Layer Internet Model presents a theoretical framework for understanding the evolving structure of the internet. The model encompasses three distinct layers: the physical infrastructure layer, the logical layer, and the content layer.¹⁶⁸ The physical infrastructure layer involves the tangible hardware and network components that enable data transmission.¹⁶⁹ The logical layer involves the protocols and standards that govern data transmission, while the content layer comprises the information, data, and services accessible to users.¹⁷⁰\n98. As the internet has become an essential part of modern societies, States have sought to assert control over cyberspace, giving rise to the concept of cyber sovereignty. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State’s desire and efforts to assert control and regulation over the virtual realm, including internet access, content, and data flow within its borders.¹⁷¹ While cyberspace transcends\n165 John M.

The functioning of cyberspace does not rely upon a single ICT infrastructure in one territory; rather, it requires extensive cooperation and interconnection with other ICT infrastructures globally.¹⁷³ Cyberspace is a borderless and interconnected domain that operates across multiple jurisdictions, and its seamless functioning depends on the collaboration between different countries and their respective ICT systems. The Internet, as a core component of cyberspace, is a network of networks that spans the globe, and each network’s smooth operation is interdependent on the functioning of others.¹⁷⁴ This interconnection ensures data transfer, communication, and accessibility across borders, facilitating the exchange of information and services on a global scale.\n100. Cooperation among various stakeholders is crucial in maintaining the stability and functionality of cyberspace. Governments, private companies, internet service providers, and technical organisations work together to develop and implement technical standards, policies, and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet and cyberspace.¹⁷⁵ Additionally, international agreements and treaties facilitate cooperation on issues such as cybersecurity, data protection, and intellectual property rights. This collaborative approach fosters an inclusive and interconnected cyberspace, ensuring that it remains a valuable and essential tool for communication, innovation, and economic growth on a global scale.\n(Council on Foreign Relations, 30 October 2019) (https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty); Anqi Wang, Cyber Sovereignty at Its Boldest: A Chinese Perspective, 16(2) The Ohio State Technology Law Journal (2020), 403-417.\n172 Milton Mueller, Sovereignty and Cyberspace: Institutions and Internet Governance (Regulation and Governance, 2018) (https://www.intgovforum.org/sites/default/files/webform/week13-cyberspace-sovereignty.pdf); Ali Shoker, Digital Sovereignty Strategies for Every Nation, 1(1) Applied Cybersecurity &amp; Internet Governance (2022), 6-9; Sam Wood et al., Digital Sovereignty: the Overlap and Conflict between States, Enterprises and Citizens (2020), 5-7.\n173 Tomasz Zdikot, Cyberspace and Cybersecurity, in: Katarzyna Chałubińska-Jentkiewicz et al.

In cyberspace, the involvement of non-State actors plays a significant role in shaping its governance and technical aspects. One notable example of a non-State actor in cyberspace governance is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).¹⁷⁶ The IETF is a global community of experts, engineers, and researchers who develop and promote voluntary standards and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP).¹⁷⁷ This open and collaborative organization operates independently of any government and allows various stakeholders to contribute to the development and maintenance of internet standards.\n102. The IETF’s role in shaping the technical foundations of cyberspace exemplifies the influence of non-State actors in the functioning of the digital realm.¹⁷⁸ As an inclusive and decentralized organisation, the IETF invites contributions from individuals, academics, private sector entities, and governments, ensuring a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance.¹⁷⁹ While State actors also participate in the IETF’s discussions, its decision-making processes are transparent and open to all, allowing non-State actors to have a meaningful impact on the development and evolution of internet standards.¹⁸⁰ This involvement of non-State actors in shaping cyberspace underscores the dynamic and diverse nature of governance in the digital age.\n103. Beyond the jurisdiction of States, the functioning of the internet is partially controlled by various entities, both governmental and non-governmental, operating in the cyberspace arena. One significant non-governmental entity that exerts influence over internet governance is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).¹⁸¹ ICANN is responsible for managing and coordinating the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses.¹⁸² This coordination ensures the stable and secure functioning of the internet, and it is\n176 Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Introduction to the IETF (https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/).\n177 Ibid.\n178 Ibid.\n179 Ibid., Group (https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/).\n180 Jacqueline Eggenschwiler, Non-State Actors and Norms of Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace (2020), 236, 315.\n181 Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ICANN for Beginners (https://www.icann.org/en/beginners).\n182 Ibid.; Jacqueline Eggenschwiler, above n.180, 236, 238, 315.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 65\nconducted through a multi-stakeholder model involving diverse stakeholders from different countries and sectors.\n104. In addition to ICANN, various private technology corporations, such as major internet service providers and tech giants, hold significant control over the functioning of the internet beyond State jurisdiction.¹⁸³ These corporations own and operate vast portions of the internet infrastructure, including data centers, communication networks, and cloud computing services. Their actions and policies can have far-reaching impacts on the accessibility, privacy, and security of cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Furthermore, some technology companies have been involved in content moderation and censorship decisions, which can influence the free flow of information on the internet.¹⁸⁵ The multi-faceted involvement of both non-governmental organizations like ICANN and private corporations in shaping the functioning of the internet highlights the complex and evolving landscape of cyberspace sovereignty.\n105. Activities in cyberspace might have an impact on sovereignty and have extraterritorial effects. However, some propose separating cyberspace from domestic law, as Chinese President Xi Jinping did when emphasizing the idea of cyber sovereignty.¹⁸⁶ In general discussions of jurisdiction, the\n183 Hongfei Gu, Data, Big Tech, and the New Concept of Sovereignty, Journal of Chinese Political Science (2023), 1-22.\n184 Ibid.\n185 See for example, Maxwell Timothy, Big Tech Censorship: What Is It and Why Should You Be Concerned?

A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n106. Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).¹⁸⁷\nCyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.¹⁸⁸\n107. The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.\n108. Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace. There are a few international agreements and conventions dealing with\nCreemers, China’s Conception of Cyber Sovereignty: Rhetoric and Realization, in: Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg, Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (2020), 107-144; Binxing Fang, above n.73, v.\n¹⁸⁷ Binxing Fang, above n.73, 78.\n¹⁸⁸ Ibid., 84.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 67\ninternet issues, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁸⁹ and the UN Cybercrime treaty,¹⁹⁰ but a clear consensus on how these agreements should be universally applied to the unique dynamics of cyberspace is lacking.\n109. It is possible to argue that ICT threats may have consequences ranging from State sovereignty to cyberspace sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty in international law is significant because sovereignty in relation to territories, populations, and regimes inside its territory is relevant to cyberspace.\n110. In the context of cyber operations, the Three-Layer Internet Model aids in understanding the implications of different activities on State sovereignty.¹⁹¹ Low-level cyber operations, such as passive information gathering, may not necessarily violate sovereignty, as they do not involve significant intrusion or disruption.¹⁹² However, high-level cyber operations, like cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure or disinformation campaigns, can directly challenge a State's sovereignty by jeopardizing its ability to govern and protect its population.¹⁹³\n111. The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations.¹⁹⁴ Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain. For instance, China's Great Firewall exemplifies a cyber sovereignty approach, where the State enforces strict controls over internet access and content to maintain political stability.¹⁹⁵\n189 Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 November 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) ETS 185 (Budapest Convention).\n190 United Nations General Assembly, 74/247 Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes (20 January 2020), UN Doc.

The concepts of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and cyber sovereignty represent distinct layers of authority in the digital age. Sovereignty remains anchored in territorial control, jurisdiction extends beyond borders, and cyber sovereignty emerges as States grapple with regulating the virtual realm. Understanding the implications of different cyber operations on State sovereignty is crucial for crafting effective cyber policies and fostering international cooperation in the digital era. By incorporating the Three-Layer Internet Model, policymakers can navigate the complexities of cyberspace and strike a balance between safeguarding sovereignty and fostering an open and secure global Internet environment.\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n113. International law applies to cyberspace sovereignty in several ways, primarily. One of the primary means is through the principle of State sovereignty, which affirms the ability of States to govern and control their territory. This argument is used to explain States' regulation and control of the internet within their borders,¹⁹⁶ which includes the capacity to restrict or prohibit certain websites, manage online material, and respond to cyber threats emanating from within their borders.\n114. Another way international law applies to internet sovereignty is through the principle of non-intervention in other States' internal affairs.¹⁹⁷ This principle is employed to defend governments' capacity to respond to cyber threats that originate beyond their borders, such as through defensive cyber operations or the imposition of penalties against foreign entities.\n115. International treaties and agreements also allow the application of international law to cyberspace sovereignty. The ICCPR, for example,\nterpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways); Jessica Baron, Cyber-Sovereignty and China's Great Firewall: An Interview With James Griffiths (Forbes, 8 April 2019) (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2019/04/08/cyber-sovereignty-and-chinas-great-firewall-an-interview-with-james-griffiths/?sh=2c0c9a43747b).\n196 Michael N.

The ICCPR, one of the most important international instruments for protecting human rights online, has direct relevance to the issue of cyberspace sovereignty. Article 19 of the ICCPR preserves the right to free speech and prohibits arbitrary privacy infringements.²⁰⁰ These rights are directly relevant to cyberspace since they safeguard people’s capacity to access and distribute information online without intervention from authorities.²⁰¹ The ICCPR also acknowledges the right to peaceful assembly, which applies to online gatherings such as demonstrations and social media campaigns.²⁰² Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful intervention with privacy, which is directly relevant to cyberspace.²⁰³ The right to privacy includes the right to have personal data protected and is especially important in the internet environment, where massive amounts of personal data are gathered, kept, and shared.²⁰⁴\n117. International treaties like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime²⁰⁵ (BCC) establish frameworks for dealing with cybercrime. The BCC is an important international mechanism for the application of\n198 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art.19.\n199 United Nations Human Rights Council, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the internet (27 June 2016), A/HRC/32/L.20, para.1; NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (Press Release, 9 July 2016) (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_133169.htm), para.70; G8, G8 Summit of Deauville, Declaration: Renewed Commitment for Freedom and Democracy (26-27 May 2021) (https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_05/20110926_110526-G8-Summit-Deauville.pdf), para.II/11; Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs.²⁰⁶ This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n118. The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime.²⁰⁷ Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders.²⁰⁸ The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software.²⁰⁹ This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence,²¹⁰ allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.\n119. Despite the existence of the BCC, the absence of direct legislation for cyberspace creates challenges. The international legal system, guided by principles such as State sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States, lacks a well-defined framework to handle the complexities of cyberspace. While the UN Charter and other international agreements, which touch upon issues of sovereignty and self-defense,²¹¹ can be invoked to legitimize State actions safeguarding national security interests in cyberspace, they\n206 Ibid., art. 22.\n207 Ibid., arts. 23-27.\n208 Ibid.\n209 Ibid., arts. 7-8.\n210 Ibid., arts. 20-21.\n211 UN Charter, art. 51.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71\ndo not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.\n120. Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply.\n## VI. Conclusion\n121. In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.\n122. The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.\n123. The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain. The Tallinn Manual, a legal guide on the\nChinese JIL (2024)\napplication of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.²¹²\n124. Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.\n125. While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked.\n²¹² Michael N.

Cyber-attacks targeting key infrastructure can undermine sovereignty by aiding another State's territorial control. The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.\n# I. Introduction\n1. In the realm of modern digital interactions, envision yourself sitting at your computer, immersed in your daily routine when an email notification grabs your attention. The sender appears to be your trusted bank, urgently notifying you of an account issue and providing a link to rectify the situation. Intrigued and slightly concerned, you click on the link, inadvertently divulging your sensitive information on what turns out to be a fraudulent website. Unbeknownst to you, you have fallen victim to a shrewd cybercriminal tactic known as email phishing.\n2. This scenario of email phishing serves as a tangible example, one that resonates with countless individuals, of the pervasive nature of information and communication technology (ICT) threats. These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away. Thus, combating these modern perils necessitates a collaborative, global strategy that supersedes conventional territorial limits—a manifestation of how sovereignty has evolved in the digital age.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 27\n3. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a surge in ICT utilization for remote operations, has accentuated the pivotal role of these technologies. While ICT empowers States, businesses, and individuals, its rapid advancement has also brought forth intricacies and concerns that ripple far beyond national frontiers. The interconnectedness facilitated by these technologies underscores the importance of grappling with the evolving concept of sovereignty, as we navigate an increasingly borderless digital landscape.\n4. “ICT threats” are malicious uses of ICTs perpetrated by both State and non-State actors with a significant impact on a variety of factors. ICT threats can be divided into three categories. First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States. It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system, might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited. The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals. The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism. This issue has the potential to threaten international safety and security.\n5. Despite these issues, there is currently no special international legislation dealing with ICT risks, notably State-sponsored cyber threats. Thus far, the only efforts to address such government operations have involved the application of existing international law, including the prohibition on the use of\n1.

Ibid., paras.13-14.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nforce under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, the customary international law principles of non-intervention, sovereignty, State responsibility and countermeasures, international human rights law, such as Human Rights Council Resolution 20/8 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). However, some of these laws and regulations do not apply effectively to the State’s conduct in cyberspace. In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security. The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace. Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace. Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n6. Some regional laws address cyber-related issues. For example, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) initiated by the Council of Europe, regulates collaboration among parties in the protection of the community against cybercrime, by harmonizing domestic law, improving investigative procedures, and boosting cooperation among member States. The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection has not yet come into force. It aims to establish a credible framework for cybersecurity in Africa by organizing electronic transactions, protecting personal data, promoting cybersecurity, e-governance and combating cybercrime.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 29\n7. In a narrower context, several international organizations have also come forward to acknowledge the current state of international law as applied to cyberspace. For example, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 73/266 supports the use of ICT for peaceful purposes, calls for the prevention of the conflict caused by ICT usage, and the provision of education on advancements in the field of ICTs in the context of international security. The European Union (EU) has examined and exchanged views on worldwide cyber security challenges; such efforts have expedited collaboration among EU member States, including diplomatic collaboration and the development of cyber diplomacy skills and an EU Cybersecurity Strategy. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also adopted a crucial strategy document on 28 January 2021, the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025), which is intended to protect against cyberspace threats and assist the digital economy and community. This is only a strategy document and is not legally enforceable.\n8. This research article has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the nature of international law in cyberspace and how it impacts State sovereignty, leading to cross-border consequences. The second goal is to examine how the application of international law to cyberspace has contributed to the growth of cyberspace sovereignty. It seeks to address three key questions: First, do non-physical ICT threats violate the sovereignty of other States? If so, to what extent does current international law apply to such threats? Second, can domestic cyberspace laws have cross-border effects, and to what\nPure Sovereignty in Cyberspace, 5 February 2024 (https://opiniojuris.org/2024/02/05/the-african-union-rightly-endorses-pure-sovereignty-in-cyberspace/).\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nextent? And third, does the principle of cyberspace sovereignty exist, and how does it compare to the principle of territorial sovereignty?\n9. This research article is structured into four primary sections. The initial section offers an overview of ICT threats and their interplay with international law, examining the existence of such threats, and their legal implications for States, and providing insights into international law within the cyberspace context. It examines principles such as State sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force within the cyberspace context. Subsequently, the following section highlights a critical concern—State sovereignty violation. It elucidates the key legal issues and relevant applicable laws. Moreover, the subsequent part delves into the intricate matter of extraterritorial effects in cyberspace, exploring the associated legal complexities and applicable legal frameworks. Lastly, the concluding section investigates the emerging realm of cyberspace sovereignty and its interaction with international law. By analyzing these multifaceted dimensions, this research aims to enhance comprehension of the evolving legal landscape within cyberspace and underscore the necessity for comprehensive international regulations.\n## II. Overview of ICT threats in international law\n10. This section presents an overview of the threats posed by ICT from the perspective of international law. The existence of ICT risks is becoming increasingly threatening. This section is divided into two subsections: (1) the existence of ICT risks and the legal effects on States and (2) international law in cyberspace. The first briefly highlights the nature of ICT threats and the risk they pose to international security and stability, economic and social growth, security, and individual well-being. The other subsection presents an overview of existing international law relevant to cyberspace as a foundation for how current international law might be applied to challenges posed by ICT threats.\n## II.A. Existence of ICT threats and legal effects on States\n11. The challenges of addressing ICT threats are not new and have received considerable attention. The GGE on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security was established in 2011 to assess actual and prospective dangers, and to address issues of ICT use impacting the international community and the\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 31\nrisks that it may be used in a manner inconsistent with the preservation of international stability and security. This would gravely jeopardize the integrity of the State and individual infrastructure. Following that, additional meetings were conducted to address the existence of ICT dangers, which may be described as follows.\n12. The malicious use of ICT presents a complex and evolving challenge, encompassing cyberattacks, data breaches and other cyber threats that transcend borders and undermine State sovereignty. Beyond immediate material harm, these activities have far-reaching societal, economic, and geopolitical consequences, necessitating a comprehensive response that combines technical solutions, legal frameworks, and international cooperation. Addressing malicious ICT use requires ongoing innovation and collaboration to ensure a secure digital environment for individuals, businesses, and governments.\n13. ICT threats, broadly defined as the intentional and malicious use of information technology, which can be orchestrated by State or non-State actors. The characterization of activities as ICT threats may vary geographically, yet their consequences have global implications. However, the classification of activities as ICT threats necessitates adherence to specific criteria.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nThese criteria include the potential to pose a significant risk to international security and stability, as well as to economic and social growth, and human safety and well-being. While instances of ICT misuse may not uniformly impact international security and stability, they might be driven by political or other motives.\n14. Characteristics of malicious ICT usage may appear in many circumstances, for example, ICT is used aggressively to achieve military goals. This form of ICT activity has the potential to be utilized as a tool or weapon in future wars between States.\n15. Second, such acts may be used to wage abusive information campaigns to impact the processes, systems, and general stability of other States and may directly or indirectly impact individuals.\n16. Third, ICT activities can cause harm to essential infrastructure supporting services at the national, regional, or international levels. The critical information infrastructure targeted and subject to critical assaults includes essential public services, especially critical technological infrastructure on the internet, and businesses in the health sector. Information concerning a person's health is highly sensitive and vulnerable, as has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n17. Fourth, ICT might be employed for terrorist reasons. Such actions might involve the direct use of ICT for terrorism or troop allocation. The use of ICT to provide financial assistance, training, and promotion and the act of assaulting ICT infrastructure are all examples of unlawful ICT usage.\n18. Misuse of ICT can be classified according to the technique, procedure, and method employed; for example, cyber-attack, cyber espionage, cybercrime, or cyberterrorism all constitute forms of misuse. However, this article does not go into detail regarding each category and only a brief overview of these ICT threats is provided.\n19. In the realm of modern warfare and national security, the terminologies of cyber operations and cyber-attacks have gained prominence in military\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 33\nmanuals of various States, including the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). However, these concepts are not unique to the UK and the US; other nations also define and address them in their military doctrines. For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare. Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.\n20. In the UK military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the planning and synchronization of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of maneuver and to achieve military objectives.” On the other hand, cyber-attacks are considered a subset of cyber operations and are described as “leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defense’s logistic capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life. As such, a cyberattack could have comparable effects to a physical attack.” Similarly, in the US military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace”, whereas cyber-attacks represent “actions taken in cyberspace that create noticeable denial effects (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) in cyberspace or\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nmanipulation that leads to denial that appears in a physical domain, and is considered a form of fires\".36\n21. The distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks is of utmost significance, as it delineates the varying intents and implications associated with these concepts. In the US military manual, cyber-attacks are regarded as akin to the use of force, thereby connecting them to the principle of self-defense under international law.37 This perspective suggests that cyber-attacks can potentially cause significant harm, prompting responses within the framework of traditional armed conflicts.38 However, it is important to note that this viewpoint is specific to the US, and not all States universally agree with this classification. Conversely, cyber operations encompass a broader spectrum of activities in cyberspace, covering not only offensive and defensive actions but also non-kinetic operations.39 These may include intelligence gathering, disruption of enemy communications, or the safeguarding of critical infrastructure. The broader definition of cyber operations underscores that not all activities in cyberspace are tantamount to cyber-attacks.\n22. Given the unique attributes of cyberspace, the distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks becomes even more complex. The fluidity and virtual nature of cyberspace blur traditional boundaries, making it challenging to pinpoint the location or source of certain actions.40 This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors, including State and non-State entities, to perpetrate cyber-attacks while concealing their identity and intent.41 The difficulty in attribution poses a significant challenge in terms of international legal frameworks and responses to cyber incidents.\n23. The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates the development of comprehensive strategies to address the nuances of cyber operations and\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 35\ncyber-attacks effectively. States are increasingly recognizing the importance of bolstering their cyber capabilities and establishing robust cyber defense mechanisms. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation and information-sharing to counter cyber threats collectively. However, divergent national perspectives and varying thresholds for response have led to debates about how to effectively regulate and govern cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n24. Various forms of cyber operations represent distinct levels of intrusion into computer networks and systems, making them essential factors in evaluating violations of State sovereignty. Among these cyber operations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and malware are prominent examples. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Such attacks do not necessarily breach the target’s network but can disrupt critical services and impact a nation’s ability to function effectively in cyberspace. For example, the deployment of DDoS attacks against Estonia in 2007 had a tremendous impact on the country’s internet infrastructure.\n25. A cyber-attack is commonly defined as any activity aimed at degrading the functionality of a computer network for a political or national security objective. This is evident in incidents that is previously mentioned when the Estonia fell victim to DDoS attacks, highlighting how cyber-attacks can intertwine political goal. While the primary focus is on activities with political or national security objectives, it is important to acknowledge that cyber\n William Banks, Cyber Attribution and State Responsibility, 97 International Law Studies (2021), 1065; European Commission, Cyber: towards stronger EU capabilities for effective operational cooperation, solidarity and resilience, Press Release, 18 April 2023 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2243); Matt Kucik, How State and Local Governments Can Bolster their Cyber Defenses, Tenable, 24 May 2022 (https://pt-br.tenable.com/blog/how-state-and-local-governments-can-bolster-their-cyber-defenses).\n U.

Singer and Allan Friedman, ibid., 125.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nactivities may serve various purposes, extending beyond political motivations. The term “cyber operations” could serve as a more encompassing umbrella, covering a range of activities in cyberspace, from intelligence gathering to disruptive operations. The absence of a uniform cluster-definition in international law to differentiate between these activities highlights a challenge, and the regulation of such activities may require a detailed and careful approach, accounting for the diversity of cyber operations.\n26. Malware, on the other hand, refers to malicious software designed to infiltrate and compromise computer systems. It can range from ransomware, which encrypts valuable data until a ransom is paid, to advanced persistent threats (APTs) capable of clandestinely maintaining long-term access to targeted systems. These forms of cyber operations pose significant challenges to the affected States, as they can lead to data breaches, economic losses, and even the manipulation of critical infrastructure.\n27. Recent cyber incidents have demonstrated the varying degrees of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. The 2020 SolarWinds attack, a sophisticated supply-chain compromise, involved the insertion of a backdoor into the software update of SolarWinds, a widely used IT management tool. The attackers targeted various government and private organizations, including sensitive government agencies, marking a high level of intrusion into critical systems.\n What is malware?: Malware or malicious software definition, Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware); What is malware?, CISCO (https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/what-is-malware.html).\n What is an APT, Imperva (https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/apt-advanced-persistent-threat/); Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Attacks’, Cynet (https://www.cynet.com/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-attacks/).\n Saheed Oladimeji and Sean Michael Kerner, SolarWinds hack explained: Everything you need to know, TechTarget, 2023 (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know); Isabella Jibilian and Katie Canales, The US is readying sanctions against Russia over the SolarWinds cyber attack.

Similarly, the interference in the 2016 US presidential election revealed the potential for cyber operations to influence political processes. State-sponsored actors leveraged phishing attacks to gain access to political organizations' networks, stole sensitive data, and conducted disinformation campaigns. This intrusion highlighted the impact of cyber operations on a nation's democratic processes and raised concerns about safeguarding sovereignty and electoral integrity.\n29. These examples underscore the significance of understanding the varying levels of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. Assessing the violation of State sovereignty in cyberspace necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the techniques, tools, and intentions behind cyber operations. Moreover, international cooperation and robust cybersecurity measures are imperative to safeguard States from cyber threats that have the potential to disrupt vital functions, compromise national security, and infringe upon sovereignty.\n30. Cyber espionage may take several forms. It can be physical, for example, where code is placed into hardware to restrict access from a stream, or it might rely on cable channels. It might leverage the spread of malware to control communication flows or take a more sophisticated form, such as phishing, to acquire access and modify data.\n31. Cybercrimes are crimes perpetrated in cyberspace by employing various technological instruments, such as assaults on computer systems to damage\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\ncyberinfrastructure. Cybercrimes are acts that jeopardize the trust, integrity, and availability of computer data or systems, such as unauthorized access, interception, or acquisition of computer data, or illegal intervention. They can constitute fraud, unlawful copyright, or trademark activity, hate speech, or the transmission of illegal or infringing personal information directed at persons or financial information.\n32. Finally, cyberterrorism refers to the utilization of computer network technologies with the intent to disrupt critical national infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and government operations, or to coerce and instill fear in a government or civilian population. The spectrum of cyberterrorism activities encompasses propaganda, financial manipulation, training, planning, or execution of cyber-attacks.\n## II.B. Overview of international law in cyberspace\n33. Misuse of ICT necessarily has consequences for the State, particularly in legal terms. The first and most important legal impact concerns State sovereignty. The action constituting an ICT threat differs in nature from conventional actions or omissions such as the use of the military to violate the territorial integrity of other States by deploying weapons, or interfering with or influencing politics. The nature of harmful applications of ICT is not\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 39\nphysical and may not include the element of physical intrusion on another State’s territory. It might take the shape of internet acts involving acts outside the State.\n34. Despite the absence of physical intrusion, cyber-attacks can influence the State, raising questions about their classification under traditional international law concepts like Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Assessing the effectiveness of a weapon, including cyber-attacks, may involve considering the harm caused. Furthermore, ICT misuse could amount to intervention in the internal affairs of other States, invoking the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, which are foundational in international law.\n35. The complexities surrounding the integration of international law into cyberspace constitute a dynamic challenge that has recently attracted the interest of scholars, policymakers, and practitioners. One of the most challenging aspects of applying international law to cyberspace is that it is a virtual rather than a physical domain. The anonymity and transnational character of cyberspace operations make it difficult to place responsibility for cyber incidents on individual participants.\n Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace: Sovereignty Redux?, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 22-23.\n Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 11; Corfu Channel, Separate Opinion of Judge Alvarez, ICJ Reports 1949, 43; Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970 containing the Declaration of Principles of International Law, Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, UN Doc.

Blank and Patrick D. Gallagher, Information Security (2012), B-3; Penny Pritzker, Supplemental Information for the Interagency Report on Strategic US Government Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve US Objectives for Cybersecurity (2015), 41; Wilbur L. Ross Jr, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations (2020), 401; Ron Ross et al., Developing Cyber-Resilient Systems: A Systems Security Engineering Approach (2021), 62.\nChinese JIL (2024)\n36. Despite these challenges, experts and practitioners are increasingly in agreement that existing international law applies to cyberspace. According to the Human Rights Council and GGE, “the same rights that States have offline must also be protected online”[64] and that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the UN, is applicable and is essential for ensuring peace and security in the online environment.”[65]\n37. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that the core concepts of international law, such as State sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention, apply equally to the cyber domain. Therefore, this section discusses three key principles of international law: the principle of State sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, and the principle of prohibition of the use of force.\n## II.B.i. Principle of State sovereignty\n38. Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory.[66] This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace.[67] It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters.[68] Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines.[69] It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders.[70] In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal. Thus, differentiating sovereignty and jurisdiction holds key\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 41\nimportance in discerning cyber sovereignty's extent, given its control over cross-border cyber activities.\n39. There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.\n40. The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n41. First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n42. Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78\n43. Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.\n44. To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 43\n## II.B.ii. Principle of non-intervention\n45. The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law. It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention. It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.\n46. Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives. Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions. Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.\n47. Coercion, however, extends beyond mere pressure by involving threats or forceful actions that limit a State’s choices and significantly reduce its\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nautonomy. $^{85}$ While distinguishing between pressure and coercion can sometimes be subtle, the key factor is the degree to which a State's sovereignty is eroded, and its capacity for independent decision-making is curtailed. Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. $^{86}$ Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. $^{87}$\n48. Intervention in cyberspace is another main priority of the GGE; the State should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. $^{88}$ According to the GGE report, States shall not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including using ICTs, in conformity with the principle of non-intervention. $^{89}$ The following considerations shape the use of the term \"coercion\" in non-intervention principles, and the term can be interpreted to describe a wide range of cyberspace activities.\n49. Furthermore, States must respect the sovereignty of other States by refraining from cyber activities that might violate another State's territorial\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 45\nintegrity, including initiating a cyber-attack against another’s critical infrastructure or military systems or launching a cyber-attack against another’s territory.\n50. In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States.\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n51. The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war. It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations.\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that,\nin their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.\nThus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain as they inherently cause harm in two distinct\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties. It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n52. Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains. For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS). The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges. The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace. It also emphasizes the importance of States developing norms and legislation for responsible State behavior in that realm.\nCommonwealth &amp; Development Office, Application of international law to states’ conduct in cyberspace: UK statement (UK: Policy Paper, 3 June 2021) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement); HM Government, National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021 (2016) (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf).\n Michael N.

Broad, et al., above n.97.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 47\n53. Other scholars argue that the unique characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to apply the use of force principle in the same manner as in other domains. Rather, they claim that cyber operations that do not result in physical harm or loss of life are a type of coercion that falls short of force. A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force. Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.\n54. The use of ICT in the cyber domain, as stated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, arises from the fact that certain cyber activities can cause damage in two distinct ways.\n55. Firstly, traditional exercises of physical force typically involve the direct application of kinetic energy, resulting in visible and tangible destruction. However, cyber operations can also cause significant harm and destruction through non-kinetic means, such as disrupting critical infrastructure, compromising sensitive data, and disabling essential services. In the cyber domain, the use of force is not limited to physical impact but can manifest in various ways that may lead to severe consequences. For instance, cyberattacks targeting vital systems like power grids, financial institutions, or communication networks can disrupt the functioning of an entire nation, resulting in significant casualties and economic losses.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n56. Second, cyber activities may have cascading effects, leading to a domino effect of disruptions and harm that extends far beyond the initial target. For instance, a cyber operation aimed at disabling a country's military communication network could inadvertently impact civilian communication systems, compromising public safety and welfare. The interconnected nature of digital infrastructure amplifies the potential damage and casualties resulting from cyber operations.\n57. The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and play an increasingly crucial role in international affairs, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable behavior and defining the thresholds for the use of force in the cyber domain remains a pressing challenge for the international community.\n58. A new interpretation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force may be needed to account for the features of cyberspace and guarantee the principle's application to this domain. As previously stated, the anonymity of actors and the lack of physical damage in cyberspace make applying the conventional understanding of the use of force difficult. Furthermore, because there is no clear international consensus on how to define the use of force in the cyber domain, States may have differing views of what constitutes a use of force in the cyber domain. A new interpretation of the use of force\nindustry compare when it comes to the financial loss exposure of cyber threats? (World Economic Forum, 7 May 2023) (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/how-does-your-industry-compare-when-it-comes-to-the-financial-impact-of-cyber-threats/).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 49\nprinciple in the Charter might guarantee it is relevance to cyberspace and its consistent and predictable application.\n59. Alternatively, new international rules specific to cyberspace may be required to solve the issues particular to that domain. For example, the Tallinn Manuals, which define new norms and principles of State behavior in cyberspace, might offer clarity on how existing international law relates to online environments. New international treaties or conventions addressing the use of force in cyberspace could offer a more complete and explicit framework to guide State behavior in this domain.\n60. To conclude, while the application of international law to cyberspace is a complicated and dynamic matter, there is growing consensus that existing law is relevant. There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty. Furthermore, the ongoing debate over the use of force in cyberspace highlights the need for additional clarity and legal frameworks to control State behavior in this sphere.\n61. Other international law not addressed in this article includes the principle of State responsibility, international human rights and humanitarian law. For the sake of being concise, this section does not address these in any depth.\n## III. State sovereignty violation and international law\n62. The legal complexities in the cyberspace domain can be examined through diverse lenses, shaped by the application of laws to actions occurring within this digital realm. This section delves into pivotal issues encompassing the modern enforcement of international law in the cyberspace arena, commencing with the breach of State sovereignty and the pertinent questions\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nregarding the applicability of international legal principles to the cyber environment.\n## III.A. State sovereignty violation: the legal issue\n63. While jurisdiction is a vital component of sovereignty, it is not always territorially bound. In the context of cyberspace, where borders become blurred and the virtual world extends beyond physical boundaries, a clear distinction between these two principles becomes crucial. This discussion aims to analyze the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty, emphasizing their distinct scopes and implications, particularly in the context of cyber sovereignty and potential violations of State sovereignty.\n64. Sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international law that requires States to employ and restrict the extent of their activities within their sovereign territory while not infringing on the sovereignty of other States. The notion of “territory” is legal and political and applies to geographical or physical areas. The scope of any State’s sovereignty in respect of its territory may be enlarged to cover regions that, while not geographical or physical, have a legal component.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 51\n65. Given the present international rules applicable to cyberspace, the unlawful use of ICT can infringe on other States' sovereignty. One significant issue for international law's applicability to cyberspace is whether it can be enforced within a State's territory.\n66. The GGE study recognized that international law is applicable, maintaining that the UN Charter and the principle of State sovereignty can be applied in cyberspace. The Group reaffirms that\nState sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by states of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory. Existing obligations under international law are applicable to states' ICT-related activity.^[118]^\nThis demonstrates that ICT-related acts, even when not undertaken on another State's territory, can infringe on another State's sovereignty. States may exercise sovereignty by exerting their authority in cyber structures located in their territory over persons, including citizens of other States, residing in their sovereign area.^[119]^\n67. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State's capacity to govern activities within its cyberspace borders, including the regulation and control of information flow, data privacy, and cybersecurity.^[120]^ As Yochai Benkler notes in the article \"From Consumers to Users\", cyberspace can be divided into three layers—physical infrastructure, logical infrastructure, and content and application layers.^[121]^ Cyber sovereignty involves a State's ability to assert control\n^[118]^ GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n^[119]^ Google Spain SL v.

The scope of cyber sovereignty encompasses not only territorial jurisdiction but also extraterritorial jurisdiction based on the effects principle. States can assert jurisdiction over cyber activities that have direct and substantial effects within their borders, regardless of where the actions originated.\n69. Violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace occur when one State conducts cyber operations or cyber-attacks that undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of another State. Such violations may involve cyber espionage, data breaches, or cyber warfare, targeting a State's critical infrastructure, government systems, or sensitive information.\n70. The legal implications and scope of using sovereignty in cyberspace should be limited. States have sovereignty over information and communications technology infrastructure within their territory, according to the founding concept of sovereignty. An essential consideration is that the use of sovereignty must not infringe on the sovereignty of another State. This means that the use of ICTs must not jeopardize other States' cyberinfrastructure.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 53\nCyber-attacks on its critical infrastructure threaten State sovereignty and may be seen as evidence of intervention in its territorial sovereignty.\n## III.B. State sovereignty violation: applicable law\n71. There is an increasing need for an international legal framework to address these challenges since traditional forms of State sovereignty are no longer adequate to meet the international character of cyberspace. The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States is one of the keyways that international law is applied to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n72. The principle of non-intervention has been applied to address challenges such as cyber espionage and cyber assaults on State-controlled infrastructure. For example, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack has been deemed a violation of US sovereignty, illustrating how State sovereignty can be encroached upon in cyberspace and how international law can be employed to address such infringements. The US government attributed the attack to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), leading to the\n Finland, ibid., 2; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Grounded in the principle of non-intervention, the US government responded by imposing sanctions on the DPRK and taking other measures to hold its government accountable. Hacking identified here as a type of cyber intrusion, was attributed by the US government to the DPRK. The US response, including the imposition of penalties, can be seen as an effort to hold the country accountable for its actions and discourage future cyber intrusions. The actions taken by the US also convey a message to other nations that cross-border intrusions will not be tolerated and will be met with a response.\n73. The principle of jurisdiction is another way in which international law applies to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. The power of a State to exercise control over a certain area or individuals is referred to as jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in cyberspace may be a complicated problem since it is not always apparent where a certain cyber-related action is taking place or who is liable for it.\n74. Several revisions and adaptations may be required for the successful application of international law to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. One possible modification would be to explain the application to cyber activities of existing norms of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention. This modification could include the development of new legal interpretations or more detailed guidance on how these principles should be implemented in the context of cyberspace. Another adaptation would be to create new legal tools or soft instruments that explicitly handle violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. A new legally binding document on State sovereignty in cyberspace could be developed by the relevant UN entities to set out explicit norms and principles for the safeguarding of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n75. International law should address the problem of attribution and responsibility or violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. Attribution,\n Ibid.\n Michael N. Schmitt, above n.74, 173; Michael N.

Creating new legal frameworks or principles to meet this challenge may clarify the duties and responsibility of States for cyber-related activities that breach the sovereignty of others.\n## IV. Extraterritorial effects and international law\n76. Having explored the legal matters and relevant laws concerning violations of State sovereignty, another noteworthy aspect pertains to the impact of cyberspace, where multiple principles may come into play, causing cross-border implications. Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities.\n## IV.A. Extraterritorial effects: the legal issue\n77. The principle of extraterritoriality is addressed in the negative rather than the positive context. Typically, any legal action taken by a State impacts the region under its control. At times, the acts of one State may have an impact on the activities of another or within another territory and beyond its legislative jurisdiction.\n78. The question of jurisdiction is a critical one. One of the interesting types of core principles related to extraterritorial effects is the nationality\nWrongful Acts 2001, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, vol. II (part Two), A/56/49 (Vol. I)/Corr.4.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nprinciple. The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location. It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.\n79. In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities. Cyber operations conducted by individuals or entities who are nationals of a particular State may have effects that extend beyond that State's borders, potentially impacting other States and their interests. This raises questions about the application of international law to such cyber operations and whether they may be considered extraterritorial.\n80. The nationality principle serves as a legal basis for States to assert jurisdiction over cyber activities conducted by their nationals, even if the effects of those activities are felt outside their territory. This principle allows States to exercise their regulatory authority and apply their laws to address the potential harm caused by cyber operations carried out by their citizens abroad. By doing so, the nationality principle helps mitigate the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities and provides a means for States to address cyber threats that originate from their nationals.\n81. In connection with the application of international law to cyberspace, the nationality principle can be relevant in determining which State has jurisdiction over specific cyber incidents and whether a State has the right to\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 57\nrespond to cyber operations that have an impact on its interests. This principle helps establish a link between the State and the conduct of its nationals in cyberspace, enabling the State to assert its rights and responsibilities concerning the activities of its citizens in the digital realm. However, the application of the nationality principle in cyberspace can be complex, particularly when cyber operations involve multiple actors and cross-border effects, leading to debates on the scope and limitations of the jurisdiction in the digital domain.\n82. A State’s jurisdiction is typically established by its territorial boundaries in the physical world. However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace. In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor. Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach, and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law. The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n83. Another facet of international law's extraterritorial effects in cyberspace concerns the issue of State responsibility. States have an obligation under international law to avoid interfering with the rights of other States and to compensate victims for their illegal conduct. Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.\n84. There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^[151]^\n85. The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.\n86. Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^[152]^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.\n87. In conclusion, the extraterritorial impacts of domestic law in cyberspace are increasingly complicated and have grown major implications for jurisdiction, State responsibility, extraterritorial application, and human rights. While legal academics and practitioners continue to argue the optimal\n^[151]^ Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, above n.75, 154-158 and 165-167.\n^[152]^ Mireille Hildebrandt, *Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to Enforce in Cyberspace? Bodin, Schmitt, Grotius in Cyberspace*, 63(2) The University of Toronto LJ (2013), 197.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 59\nsolution to these concerns, it is evident that new techniques are required to ensure that international law can successfully govern the digital domain of cyberspace. Many international and regional legislation, policies, and recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.\n## IV.B. Extraterritorial effects: applicable law\n88. Extraterritorial effects in cyberspace have expanded in recent years, as the internet and other digital technologies have enabled individuals and non-State entities to operate beyond national borders.^[153]^ There is an increasing need for international legal frameworks to handle these challenges, as traditional notions of State sovereignty may no longer be adequate, given the global nature of cyberspace.\n89. There are several examples of international law being used to address extraterritorial effects in cyberspace.\n90. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017 is one example of the use of international law.^[154]^ The attack disrupted hospitals, businesses, and government agencies in over 150 countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers. Many States and cybersecurity experts blamed the hack on the DPRK's government.^[155]^ The UN Security Council (UNSC) has passed several resolutions and issued statements on cyber security and international law, including UNSC Resolution 2341 (2017), which recognizes\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nthe growing use of ICTs and the need for collective action to address the challenges posed by their malicious use. The UNSC has also underscored the need for States to work together to address the extraterritorial implications of cyber operations like the WannaCry attack and to combat cybercrime and the proliferation of malicious cyber tools.\n91. Another example is the Stuxnet worm. As mentioned above, the worm, identified in 2010, was developed to target and disrupt the control systems of industrial facilities, notably nuclear sites in Iran. While the identity of the attacker is not explicitly stated, it is important to note that Iran has its perspective on the origin of the attack. The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities. International law is applicable to this incident, offering a framework for the extraterritorial effects of action in cyberspace. As previously stated, the UN Charter, especially the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality, prohibits States from asserting jurisdiction over another State’s territory without its consent.\n92. The existing international legal system provides a framework for dealing with extraterritoriality in cyberspace, but it is not without constraints. The UN Charter’s principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality offer a basis for doing so, but due to the unique character of cyberspace, such as the difficulties in determining the origin and responsibility of a cyber-related action, applying these principles can be problematic. Uncertainty and the\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 61\nabsence of defined norms and principles for applying international law in cyberspace might make it difficult for States to address extraterritoriality effectively. A State’s reaction to extraterritorial impacts like cyber espionage and cyber-attacks might also be hampered by a lack of agreement on how to interpret and implement international law in cyberspace.\n93. Overcoming these limitations requires that the existing international legal framework for cyberspace be maintained and strengthened. This can be accomplished by negotiating new legally enforceable instruments, such as draft articles on State jurisdiction over cyber activities, or by developing soft law instruments, such as guidelines or recommendations. States should also continue to collaborate to build shared understandings and norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace; this can aid in clarifying the application of international law in this setting.\n## V. Cyberspace sovereignty and international law\n94. This section represents the core legal concern pertaining to the applicability of international law in the realm of cyberspace. It explores the progressive matter of cyberspace sovereignty, a subject that is infrequently examined within a broader framework. Within this section, the notion of cyberspace sovereignty is introduced, along with its associated legal intricacies, while also addressing how international law could potentially be relevant in navigating this novel domain of sovereignty.\n## V.A. Cyberspace sovereignty: the legal issue\n95. Sovereignty is traditionally understood as a territorial concept, entailing a State’s exclusive control over its territory, populace, and domestic affairs. On the other hand, jurisdiction expands beyond territorial borders\n---\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nand encompasses various principles, including the nationality principle, which grants States authority over their citizens regardless of their location. In the digital era, the emergence of cyberspace has introduced new challenges, leading to the notion of cyber sovereignty, where States assert control over the virtual realm.\n96. Sovereignty, rooted in the Westphalian system, is the bedrock of international law, emphasizing a State’s exclusive control within its territorial boundaries. It entails the supreme authority of a State over its domestic affairs, encompassing governance, laws, and enforcement mechanisms. Traditionally, sovereignty was a territorial concept, asserting that a State has the right to govern its territory and protect its national interests.\n97. Yochai Benkler’s Three-Layer Internet Model presents a theoretical framework for understanding the evolving structure of the internet. The model encompasses three distinct layers: the physical infrastructure layer, the logical layer, and the content layer. The physical infrastructure layer involves the tangible hardware and network components that enable data transmission. The logical layer involves the protocols and standards that govern data transmission, while the content layer comprises the information, data, and services accessible to users.\n98. As the internet has become an essential part of modern societies, States have sought to assert control over cyberspace, giving rise to the concept of cyber sovereignty. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State’s desire and efforts to assert control and regulation over the virtual realm, including internet access, content, and data flow within its borders. While cyberspace transcends\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 63\nphysical borders, States increasingly assert control over online activities within their territory, reflecting their quest for digital governance.\n99. The functioning of cyberspace does not rely upon a single ICT infrastructure in one territory; rather, it requires extensive cooperation and interconnection with other ICT infrastructures globally. Cyberspace is a borderless and interconnected domain that operates across multiple jurisdictions, and its seamless functioning depends on the collaboration between different countries and their respective ICT systems. The Internet, as a core component of cyberspace, is a network of networks that spans the globe, and each network’s smooth operation is interdependent on the functioning of others. This interconnection ensures data transfer, communication, and accessibility across borders, facilitating the exchange of information and services on a global scale.\n100. Cooperation among various stakeholders is crucial in maintaining the stability and functionality of cyberspace. Governments, private companies, internet service providers, and technical organisations work together to develop and implement technical standards, policies, and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet and cyberspace. Additionally, international agreements and treaties facilitate cooperation on issues such as cybersecurity, data protection, and intellectual property rights. This collaborative approach fosters an inclusive and interconnected cyberspace, ensuring that it remains a valuable and essential tool for communication, innovation, and economic growth on a global scale.\n(Council on Foreign Relations, 30 October 2019) (https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty); Anqi Wang, Cyber Sovereignty at Its Boldest: A Chinese Perspective, 16(2) The Ohio State Technology Law Journal (2020), 403-417.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n101. In cyberspace, the involvement of non-State actors plays a significant role in shaping its governance and technical aspects. One notable example of a non-State actor in cyberspace governance is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF is a global community of experts, engineers, and researchers who develop and promote voluntary standards and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP). This open and collaborative organization operates independently of any government and allows various stakeholders to contribute to the development and maintenance of internet standards.\n102. The IETF’s role in shaping the technical foundations of cyberspace exemplifies the influence of non-State actors in the functioning of the digital realm. As an inclusive and decentralized organisation, the IETF invites contributions from individuals, academics, private sector entities, and governments, ensuring a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance. While State actors also participate in the IETF’s discussions, its decision-making processes are transparent and open to all, allowing non-State actors to have a meaningful impact on the development and evolution of internet standards. This involvement of non-State actors in shaping cyberspace underscores the dynamic and diverse nature of governance in the digital age.\n103. Beyond the jurisdiction of States, the functioning of the internet is partially controlled by various entities, both governmental and non-governmental, operating in the cyberspace arena. One significant non-governmental entity that exerts influence over internet governance is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is responsible for managing and coordinating the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses. This coordination ensures the stable and secure functioning of the internet, and it is\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 65\nconducted through a multi-stakeholder model involving diverse stakeholders from different countries and sectors.\n104. In addition to ICANN, various private technology corporations, such as major internet service providers and tech giants, hold significant control over the functioning of the internet beyond State jurisdiction. These corporations own and operate vast portions of the internet infrastructure, including data centers, communication networks, and cloud computing services. Their actions and policies can have far-reaching impacts on the accessibility, privacy, and security of cyberspace. Furthermore, some technology companies have been involved in content moderation and censorship decisions, which can influence the free flow of information on the internet. The multi-faceted involvement of both non-governmental organizations like ICANN and private corporations in shaping the functioning of the internet highlights the complex and evolving landscape of cyberspace sovereignty.\n105. Activities in cyberspace might have an impact on sovereignty and have extraterritorial effects. However, some propose separating cyberspace from domestic law, as Chinese President Xi Jinping did when emphasizing the idea of cyber sovereignty. In general discussions of jurisdiction, the\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nterritory is defined as the area in which States can exercise their sovereignty. A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n106. Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).\nCyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.\n107. The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.\n108. Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace. There are a few international agreements and conventions dealing with\nCreemers, China’s Conception of Cyber Sovereignty: Rhetoric and Realization, in: Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg, Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (2020), 107-144; Binxing Fang, above n.73, v.\n Binxing Fang, above n.73, 78.\n Ibid., 84.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 67\ninternet issues, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the UN Cybercrime treaty, but a clear consensus on how these agreements should be universally applied to the unique dynamics of cyberspace is lacking.\n109. It is possible to argue that ICT threats may have consequences ranging from State sovereignty to cyberspace sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty in international law is significant because sovereignty in relation to territories, populations, and regimes inside its territory is relevant to cyberspace.\n110. In the context of cyber operations, the Three-Layer Internet Model aids in understanding the implications of different activities on State sovereignty. Low-level cyber operations, such as passive information gathering, may not necessarily violate sovereignty, as they do not involve significant intrusion or disruption. However, high-level cyber operations, like cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure or disinformation campaigns, can directly challenge a State's sovereignty by jeopardizing its ability to govern and protect its population.\n111. The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations. Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain. For instance, China's Great Firewall exemplifies a cyber sovereignty approach, where the State enforces strict controls over internet access and content to maintain political stability.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n112. The concepts of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and cyber sovereignty represent distinct layers of authority in the digital age. Sovereignty remains anchored in territorial control, jurisdiction extends beyond borders, and cyber sovereignty emerges as States grapple with regulating the virtual realm. Understanding the implications of different cyber operations on State sovereignty is crucial for crafting effective cyber policies and fostering international cooperation in the digital era. By incorporating the Three-Layer Internet Model, policymakers can navigate the complexities of cyberspace and strike a balance between safeguarding sovereignty and fostering an open and secure global Internet environment.\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n113. International law applies to cyberspace sovereignty in several ways, primarily. One of the primary means is through the principle of State sovereignty, which affirms the ability of States to govern and control their territory. This argument is used to explain States' regulation and control of the internet within their borders, which includes the capacity to restrict or prohibit certain websites, manage online material, and respond to cyber threats emanating from within their borders.\n114. Another way international law applies to internet sovereignty is through the principle of non-intervention in other States' internal affairs. This principle is employed to defend governments' capacity to respond to cyber threats that originate beyond their borders, such as through defensive cyber operations or the imposition of penalties against foreign entities.\n115. International treaties and agreements also allow the application of international law to cyberspace sovereignty. The ICCPR, for example,\nterpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways); Jessica Baron, Cyber-Sovereignty and China's Great Firewall: An Interview With James Griffiths (Forbes, 8 April 2019) (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2019/04/08/cyber-sovereignty-and-chinas-great-firewall-an-interview-with-james-griffiths/?sh=2c0c9a43747b).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 69\nrecognizes the right to free expression and the prohibition of arbitrary intervention with privacy, both of which are relevant in cyberspace.\n116. The ICCPR, one of the most important international instruments for protecting human rights online, has direct relevance to the issue of cyberspace sovereignty. Article 19 of the ICCPR preserves the right to free speech and prohibits arbitrary privacy infringements. These rights are directly relevant to cyberspace since they safeguard people’s capacity to access and distribute information online without intervention from authorities. The ICCPR also acknowledges the right to peaceful assembly, which applies to online gatherings such as demonstrations and social media campaigns. Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful intervention with privacy, which is directly relevant to cyberspace. The right to privacy includes the right to have personal data protected and is especially important in the internet environment, where massive amounts of personal data are gathered, kept, and shared.\n117. International treaties like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) establish frameworks for dealing with cybercrime. The BCC is an important international mechanism for the application of\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\ninternational law to the topic of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs. This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n118. The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders. The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software. This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence, allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.\n119. Despite the existence of the BCC, the absence of direct legislation for cyberspace creates challenges. The international legal system, guided by principles such as State sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States, lacks a well-defined framework to handle the complexities of cyberspace. While the UN Charter and other international agreements, which touch upon issues of sovereignty and self-defense, can be invoked to legitimize State actions safeguarding national security interests in cyberspace, they\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71\ndo not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.\n120. Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply.\n## VI. Conclusion\n121. In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.\n122. The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.\n123. The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain. The Tallinn Manual, a legal guide on the\nChinese JIL (2024)\napplication of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.\n124. Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.\n125. While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked.\n Michael N.

Cyber-attacks targeting key infrastructure can undermine sovereignty by aiding another State's territorial control. The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.\n# I. Introduction\n1. In the realm of modern digital interactions, envision yourself sitting at your computer, immersed in your daily routine when an email notification grabs your attention. The sender appears to be your trusted bank, urgently notifying you of an account issue and providing a link to rectify the situation. Intrigued and slightly concerned, you click on the link, inadvertently divulging your sensitive information on what turns out to be a fraudulent website. Unbeknownst to you, you have fallen victim to a shrewd cybercriminal tactic known as email phishing.\n2. This scenario of email phishing serves as a tangible example, one that resonates with countless individuals, of the pervasive nature of information and communication technology (ICT) threats. These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away. Thus, combating these modern perils necessitates a collaborative, global strategy that supersedes conventional territorial limits—a manifestation of how sovereignty has evolved in the digital age.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 27\n3. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a surge in ICT utilization for remote operations, has accentuated the pivotal role of these technologies. While ICT empowers States, businesses, and individuals, its rapid advancement has also brought forth intricacies and concerns that ripple far beyond national frontiers. The interconnectedness facilitated by these technologies underscores the importance of grappling with the evolving concept of sovereignty, as we navigate an increasingly borderless digital landscape.\n4. “ICT threats” are malicious uses of ICTs perpetrated by both State and non-State actors with a significant impact on a variety of factors. ICT threats can be divided into three categories. First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States. It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system, might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited. The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals. The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism. This issue has the potential to threaten international safety and security.\n5. Despite these issues, there is currently no special international legislation dealing with ICT risks, notably State-sponsored cyber threats. Thus far, the only efforts to address such government operations have involved the application of existing international law, including the prohibition on the use of\n1. UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security [GGE 2021 Report] (14 July 2021), UN Doc. A/76/135, paras.6-14.\n2. Ibid., para.8.\n3. Ibid., para.10.\n4. Ibid.\n5. Ibid., para.9.\n6. Ibid., paras.13-14.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nforce under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, the customary international law principles of non-intervention, sovereignty, State responsibility and countermeasures, international human rights law, such as Human Rights Council Resolution 20/8 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). However, some of these laws and regulations do not apply effectively to the State’s conduct in cyberspace. In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security. The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace. Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace. Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n6. Some regional laws address cyber-related issues. For example, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) initiated by the Council of Europe, regulates collaboration among parties in the protection of the community against cybercrime, by harmonizing domestic law, improving investigative procedures, and boosting cooperation among member States. The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection has not yet come into force. It aims to establish a credible framework for cybersecurity in Africa by organizing electronic transactions, protecting personal data, promoting cybersecurity, e-governance and combating cybercrime.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 29\n7. In a narrower context, several international organizations have also come forward to acknowledge the current state of international law as applied to cyberspace. For example, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 73/266 supports the use of ICT for peaceful purposes, calls for the prevention of the conflict caused by ICT usage, and the provision of education on advancements in the field of ICTs in the context of international security. The European Union (EU) has examined and exchanged views on worldwide cyber security challenges; such efforts have expedited collaboration among EU member States, including diplomatic collaboration and the development of cyber diplomacy skills and an EU Cybersecurity Strategy. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also adopted a crucial strategy document on 28 January 2021, the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025), which is intended to protect against cyberspace threats and assist the digital economy and community. This is only a strategy document and is not legally enforceable.\n8. This research article has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the nature of international law in cyberspace and how it impacts State sovereignty, leading to cross-border consequences. The second goal is to examine how the application of international law to cyberspace has contributed to the growth of cyberspace sovereignty. It seeks to address three key questions: First, do non-physical ICT threats violate the sovereignty of other States? If so, to what extent does current international law apply to such threats? Second, can domestic cyberspace laws have cross-border effects, and to what\nPure Sovereignty in Cyberspace, 5 February 2024 (https://opiniojuris.org/2024/02/05/the-african-union-rightly-endorses-pure-sovereignty-in-cyberspace/).\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nextent? And third, does the principle of cyberspace sovereignty exist, and how does it compare to the principle of territorial sovereignty?\n9. This research article is structured into four primary sections. The initial section offers an overview of ICT threats and their interplay with international law, examining the existence of such threats, and their legal implications for States, and providing insights into international law within the cyberspace context. It examines principles such as State sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force within the cyberspace context. Subsequently, the following section highlights a critical concern—State sovereignty violation. It elucidates the key legal issues and relevant applicable laws. Moreover, the subsequent part delves into the intricate matter of extraterritorial effects in cyberspace, exploring the associated legal complexities and applicable legal frameworks. Lastly, the concluding section investigates the emerging realm of cyberspace sovereignty and its interaction with international law. By analyzing these multifaceted dimensions, this research aims to enhance comprehension of the evolving legal landscape within cyberspace and underscore the necessity for comprehensive international regulations.\n## II. Overview of ICT threats in international law\n10. This section presents an overview of the threats posed by ICT from the perspective of international law. The existence of ICT risks is becoming increasingly threatening. This section is divided into two subsections: (1) the existence of ICT risks and the legal effects on States and (2) international law in cyberspace. The first briefly highlights the nature of ICT threats and the risk they pose to international security and stability, economic and social growth, security, and individual well-being. The other subsection presents an overview of existing international law relevant to cyberspace as a foundation for how current international law might be applied to challenges posed by ICT threats.\n## II.A. Existence of ICT threats and legal effects on States\n11. The challenges of addressing ICT threats are not new and have received considerable attention. The GGE on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security was established in 2011 to assess actual and prospective dangers, and to address issues of ICT use impacting the international community and the\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 31\nrisks that it may be used in a manner inconsistent with the preservation of international stability and security. This would gravely jeopardize the integrity of the State and individual infrastructure. Following that, additional meetings were conducted to address the existence of ICT dangers, which may be described as follows.\n12. The malicious use of ICT presents a complex and evolving challenge, encompassing cyberattacks, data breaches and other cyber threats that transcend borders and undermine State sovereignty. Beyond immediate material harm, these activities have far-reaching societal, economic, and geopolitical consequences, necessitating a comprehensive response that combines technical solutions, legal frameworks, and international cooperation. Addressing malicious ICT use requires ongoing innovation and collaboration to ensure a secure digital environment for individuals, businesses, and governments.\n13. ICT threats, broadly defined as the intentional and malicious use of information technology, which can be orchestrated by State or non-State actors. The characterization of activities as ICT threats may vary geographically, yet their consequences have global implications. However, the classification of activities as ICT threats necessitates adherence to specific criteria.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nThese criteria include the potential to pose a significant risk to international security and stability, as well as to economic and social growth, and human safety and well-being. While instances of ICT misuse may not uniformly impact international security and stability, they might be driven by political or other motives.\n14. Characteristics of malicious ICT usage may appear in many circumstances, for example, ICT is used aggressively to achieve military goals. This form of ICT activity has the potential to be utilized as a tool or weapon in future wars between States.\n15. Second, such acts may be used to wage abusive information campaigns to impact the processes, systems, and general stability of other States and may directly or indirectly impact individuals.\n16. Third, ICT activities can cause harm to essential infrastructure supporting services at the national, regional, or international levels. The critical information infrastructure targeted and subject to critical assaults includes essential public services, especially critical technological infrastructure on the internet, and businesses in the health sector. Information concerning a person's health is highly sensitive and vulnerable, as has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n17. Fourth, ICT might be employed for terrorist reasons. Such actions might involve the direct use of ICT for terrorism or troop allocation. The use of ICT to provide financial assistance, training, and promotion and the act of assaulting ICT infrastructure are all examples of unlawful ICT usage.\n18. Misuse of ICT can be classified according to the technique, procedure, and method employed; for example, cyber-attack, cyber espionage, cybercrime, or cyberterrorism all constitute forms of misuse. However, this article does not go into detail regarding each category and only a brief overview of these ICT threats is provided.\n19. In the realm of modern warfare and national security, the terminologies of cyber operations and cyber-attacks have gained prominence in military\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 33\nmanuals of various States, including the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). However, these concepts are not unique to the UK and the US; other nations also define and address them in their military doctrines. For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare. Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.\n20. In the UK military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the planning and synchronization of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of maneuver and to achieve military objectives.” On the other hand, cyber-attacks are considered a subset of cyber operations and are described as “leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defense’s logistic capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life. As such, a cyberattack could have comparable effects to a physical attack.” Similarly, in the US military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace”, whereas cyber-attacks represent “actions taken in cyberspace that create noticeable denial effects (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) in cyberspace or\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nmanipulation that leads to denial that appears in a physical domain, and is considered a form of fires\".36\n21. The distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks is of utmost significance, as it delineates the varying intents and implications associated with these concepts. In the US military manual, cyber-attacks are regarded as akin to the use of force, thereby connecting them to the principle of self-defense under international law.37 This perspective suggests that cyber-attacks can potentially cause significant harm, prompting responses within the framework of traditional armed conflicts.38 However, it is important to note that this viewpoint is specific to the US, and not all States universally agree with this classification. Conversely, cyber operations encompass a broader spectrum of activities in cyberspace, covering not only offensive and defensive actions but also non-kinetic operations.39 These may include intelligence gathering, disruption of enemy communications, or the safeguarding of critical infrastructure. The broader definition of cyber operations underscores that not all activities in cyberspace are tantamount to cyber-attacks.\n22. Given the unique attributes of cyberspace, the distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks becomes even more complex. The fluidity and virtual nature of cyberspace blur traditional boundaries, making it challenging to pinpoint the location or source of certain actions.40 This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors, including State and non-State entities, to perpetrate cyber-attacks while concealing their identity and intent.41 The difficulty in attribution poses a significant challenge in terms of international legal frameworks and responses to cyber incidents.\n23. The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates the development of comprehensive strategies to address the nuances of cyber operations and\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 35\ncyber-attacks effectively. States are increasingly recognizing the importance of bolstering their cyber capabilities and establishing robust cyber defense mechanisms. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation and information-sharing to counter cyber threats collectively. However, divergent national perspectives and varying thresholds for response have led to debates about how to effectively regulate and govern cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n24. Various forms of cyber operations represent distinct levels of intrusion into computer networks and systems, making them essential factors in evaluating violations of State sovereignty. Among these cyber operations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and malware are prominent examples. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Such attacks do not necessarily breach the target’s network but can disrupt critical services and impact a nation’s ability to function effectively in cyberspace. For example, the deployment of DDoS attacks against Estonia in 2007 had a tremendous impact on the country’s internet infrastructure.\n25. A cyber-attack is commonly defined as any activity aimed at degrading the functionality of a computer network for a political or national security objective. This is evident in incidents that is previously mentioned when the Estonia fell victim to DDoS attacks, highlighting how cyber-attacks can intertwine political goal. While the primary focus is on activities with political or national security objectives, it is important to acknowledge that cyber\n William Banks, Cyber Attribution and State Responsibility, 97 International Law Studies (2021), 1065; European Commission, Cyber: towards stronger EU capabilities for effective operational cooperation, solidarity and resilience, Press Release, 18 April 2023 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2243); Matt Kucik, How State and Local Governments Can Bolster their Cyber Defenses, Tenable, 24 May 2022 (https://pt-br.tenable.com/blog/how-state-and-local-governments-can-bolster-their-cyber-defenses).\n U.

The term “cyber operations” could serve as a more encompassing umbrella, covering a range of activities in cyberspace, from intelligence gathering to disruptive operations. The absence of a uniform cluster-definition in international law to differentiate between these activities highlights a challenge, and the regulation of such activities may require a detailed and careful approach, accounting for the diversity of cyber operations.\n26. Malware, on the other hand, refers to malicious software designed to infiltrate and compromise computer systems. It can range from ransomware, which encrypts valuable data until a ransom is paid, to advanced persistent threats (APTs) capable of clandestinely maintaining long-term access to targeted systems. These forms of cyber operations pose significant challenges to the affected States, as they can lead to data breaches, economic losses, and even the manipulation of critical infrastructure.\n27. Recent cyber incidents have demonstrated the varying degrees of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. The 2020 SolarWinds attack, a sophisticated supply-chain compromise, involved the insertion of a backdoor into the software update of SolarWinds, a widely used IT management tool. The attackers targeted various government and private organizations, including sensitive government agencies, marking a high level of intrusion into critical systems.\n What is malware?: Malware or malicious software definition, Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware); What is malware?, CISCO (https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/what-is-malware.html).\n What is an APT, Imperva (https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/apt-advanced-persistent-threat/); Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Attacks’, Cynet (https://www.cynet.com/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-attacks/).\n Saheed Oladimeji and Sean Michael Kerner, SolarWinds hack explained: Everything you need to know, TechTarget, 2023 (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know); Isabella Jibilian and Katie Canales, The US is readying sanctions against Russia over the SolarWinds cyber attack.

Similarly, the interference in the 2016 US presidential election revealed the potential for cyber operations to influence political processes. State-sponsored actors leveraged phishing attacks to gain access to political organizations' networks, stole sensitive data, and conducted disinformation campaigns. This intrusion highlighted the impact of cyber operations on a nation's democratic processes and raised concerns about safeguarding sovereignty and electoral integrity.\n29. These examples underscore the significance of understanding the varying levels of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. Assessing the violation of State sovereignty in cyberspace necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the techniques, tools, and intentions behind cyber operations. Moreover, international cooperation and robust cybersecurity measures are imperative to safeguard States from cyber threats that have the potential to disrupt vital functions, compromise national security, and infringe upon sovereignty.\n30. Cyber espionage may take several forms. It can be physical, for example, where code is placed into hardware to restrict access from a stream, or it might rely on cable channels. It might leverage the spread of malware to control communication flows or take a more sophisticated form, such as phishing, to acquire access and modify data.\n31. Cybercrimes are crimes perpetrated in cyberspace by employing various technological instruments, such as assaults on computer systems to damage\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\ncyberinfrastructure. Cybercrimes are acts that jeopardize the trust, integrity, and availability of computer data or systems, such as unauthorized access, interception, or acquisition of computer data, or illegal intervention. They can constitute fraud, unlawful copyright, or trademark activity, hate speech, or the transmission of illegal or infringing personal information directed at persons or financial information.\n32. Finally, cyberterrorism refers to the utilization of computer network technologies with the intent to disrupt critical national infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and government operations, or to coerce and instill fear in a government or civilian population. The spectrum of cyberterrorism activities encompasses propaganda, financial manipulation, training, planning, or execution of cyber-attacks.\n## II.B. Overview of international law in cyberspace\n33. Misuse of ICT necessarily has consequences for the State, particularly in legal terms. The first and most important legal impact concerns State sovereignty. The action constituting an ICT threat differs in nature from conventional actions or omissions such as the use of the military to violate the territorial integrity of other States by deploying weapons, or interfering with or influencing politics. The nature of harmful applications of ICT is not\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 39\nphysical and may not include the element of physical intrusion on another State’s territory. It might take the shape of internet acts involving acts outside the State.\n34. Despite the absence of physical intrusion, cyber-attacks can influence the State, raising questions about their classification under traditional international law concepts like Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Assessing the effectiveness of a weapon, including cyber-attacks, may involve considering the harm caused. Furthermore, ICT misuse could amount to intervention in the internal affairs of other States, invoking the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, which are foundational in international law.\n35. The complexities surrounding the integration of international law into cyberspace constitute a dynamic challenge that has recently attracted the interest of scholars, policymakers, and practitioners. One of the most challenging aspects of applying international law to cyberspace is that it is a virtual rather than a physical domain. The anonymity and transnational character of cyberspace operations make it difficult to place responsibility for cyber incidents on individual participants.\n Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace: Sovereignty Redux?, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 22-23.\n Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 11; Corfu Channel, Separate Opinion of Judge Alvarez, ICJ Reports 1949, 43; Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970 containing the Declaration of Principles of International Law, Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, UN Doc.

Ross Jr, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations (2020), 401; Ron Ross et al., Developing Cyber-Resilient Systems: A Systems Security Engineering Approach (2021), 62.\nChinese JIL (2024)\n36. Despite these challenges, experts and practitioners are increasingly in agreement that existing international law applies to cyberspace. According to the Human Rights Council and GGE, “the same rights that States have offline must also be protected online”[64] and that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the UN, is applicable and is essential for ensuring peace and security in the online environment.”[65]\n37. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that the core concepts of international law, such as State sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention, apply equally to the cyber domain. Therefore, this section discusses three key principles of international law: the principle of State sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, and the principle of prohibition of the use of force.\n## II.B.i. Principle of State sovereignty\n38. Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory.[66] This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace.[67] It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters.[68] Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines.[69] It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders.[70] In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal. Thus, differentiating sovereignty and jurisdiction holds key\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 41\nimportance in discerning cyber sovereignty's extent, given its control over cross-border cyber activities.\n39. There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.\n40. The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n41. First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n42. Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78\n43. Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.\n44. To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 43\n## II.B.ii. Principle of non-intervention\n45. The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law. It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention. It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.\n46. Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives. Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions. Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.\n47. Coercion, however, extends beyond mere pressure by involving threats or forceful actions that limit a State’s choices and significantly reduce its\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nautonomy. $^{85}$ While distinguishing between pressure and coercion can sometimes be subtle, the key factor is the degree to which a State's sovereignty is eroded, and its capacity for independent decision-making is curtailed. Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. $^{86}$ Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. $^{87}$\n48. Intervention in cyberspace is another main priority of the GGE; the State should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. $^{88}$ According to the GGE report, States shall not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including using ICTs, in conformity with the principle of non-intervention. $^{89}$ The following considerations shape the use of the term \"coercion\" in non-intervention principles, and the term can be interpreted to describe a wide range of cyberspace activities.\n49. Furthermore, States must respect the sovereignty of other States by refraining from cyber activities that might violate another State's territorial\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 45\nintegrity, including initiating a cyber-attack against another’s critical infrastructure or military systems or launching a cyber-attack against another’s territory.\n50. In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States.\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n51. The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war. It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations.\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that,\nin their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.\nThus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain as they inherently cause harm in two distinct\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties. It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n52. Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains. For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS). The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges. The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace. It also emphasizes the importance of States developing norms and legislation for responsible State behavior in that realm.\nCommonwealth &amp; Development Office, Application of international law to states’ conduct in cyberspace: UK statement (UK: Policy Paper, 3 June 2021) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement); HM Government, National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021 (2016) (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf).\n Michael N.

Broad, et al., above n.97.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 47\n53. Other scholars argue that the unique characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to apply the use of force principle in the same manner as in other domains. Rather, they claim that cyber operations that do not result in physical harm or loss of life are a type of coercion that falls short of force. A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force. Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.\n54. The use of ICT in the cyber domain, as stated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, arises from the fact that certain cyber activities can cause damage in two distinct ways.\n55. Firstly, traditional exercises of physical force typically involve the direct application of kinetic energy, resulting in visible and tangible destruction. However, cyber operations can also cause significant harm and destruction through non-kinetic means, such as disrupting critical infrastructure, compromising sensitive data, and disabling essential services. In the cyber domain, the use of force is not limited to physical impact but can manifest in various ways that may lead to severe consequences. For instance, cyberattacks targeting vital systems like power grids, financial institutions, or communication networks can disrupt the functioning of an entire nation, resulting in significant casualties and economic losses.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n56. Second, cyber activities may have cascading effects, leading to a domino effect of disruptions and harm that extends far beyond the initial target. For instance, a cyber operation aimed at disabling a country's military communication network could inadvertently impact civilian communication systems, compromising public safety and welfare. The interconnected nature of digital infrastructure amplifies the potential damage and casualties resulting from cyber operations.\n57. The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and play an increasingly crucial role in international affairs, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable behavior and defining the thresholds for the use of force in the cyber domain remains a pressing challenge for the international community.\n58. A new interpretation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force may be needed to account for the features of cyberspace and guarantee the principle's application to this domain. As previously stated, the anonymity of actors and the lack of physical damage in cyberspace make applying the conventional understanding of the use of force difficult. Furthermore, because there is no clear international consensus on how to define the use of force in the cyber domain, States may have differing views of what constitutes a use of force in the cyber domain. A new interpretation of the use of force\nindustry compare when it comes to the financial loss exposure of cyber threats? (World Economic Forum, 7 May 2023) (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/how-does-your-industry-compare-when-it-comes-to-the-financial-impact-of-cyber-threats/).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 49\nprinciple in the Charter might guarantee it is relevance to cyberspace and its consistent and predictable application.\n59. Alternatively, new international rules specific to cyberspace may be required to solve the issues particular to that domain. For example, the Tallinn Manuals, which define new norms and principles of State behavior in cyberspace, might offer clarity on how existing international law relates to online environments. New international treaties or conventions addressing the use of force in cyberspace could offer a more complete and explicit framework to guide State behavior in this domain.\n60. To conclude, while the application of international law to cyberspace is a complicated and dynamic matter, there is growing consensus that existing law is relevant. There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty. Furthermore, the ongoing debate over the use of force in cyberspace highlights the need for additional clarity and legal frameworks to control State behavior in this sphere.\n61. Other international law not addressed in this article includes the principle of State responsibility, international human rights and humanitarian law. For the sake of being concise, this section does not address these in any depth.\n## III. State sovereignty violation and international law\n62. The legal complexities in the cyberspace domain can be examined through diverse lenses, shaped by the application of laws to actions occurring within this digital realm. This section delves into pivotal issues encompassing the modern enforcement of international law in the cyberspace arena, commencing with the breach of State sovereignty and the pertinent questions\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nregarding the applicability of international legal principles to the cyber environment.\n## III.A. State sovereignty violation: the legal issue\n63. While jurisdiction is a vital component of sovereignty, it is not always territorially bound. In the context of cyberspace, where borders become blurred and the virtual world extends beyond physical boundaries, a clear distinction between these two principles becomes crucial. This discussion aims to analyze the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty, emphasizing their distinct scopes and implications, particularly in the context of cyber sovereignty and potential violations of State sovereignty.\n64. Sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international law that requires States to employ and restrict the extent of their activities within their sovereign territory while not infringing on the sovereignty of other States. The notion of “territory” is legal and political and applies to geographical or physical areas. The scope of any State’s sovereignty in respect of its territory may be enlarged to cover regions that, while not geographical or physical, have a legal component.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 51\n65. Given the present international rules applicable to cyberspace, the unlawful use of ICT can infringe on other States' sovereignty. One significant issue for international law's applicability to cyberspace is whether it can be enforced within a State's territory.\n66. The GGE study recognized that international law is applicable, maintaining that the UN Charter and the principle of State sovereignty can be applied in cyberspace. The Group reaffirms that\nState sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by states of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory. Existing obligations under international law are applicable to states' ICT-related activity.^[118]^\nThis demonstrates that ICT-related acts, even when not undertaken on another State's territory, can infringe on another State's sovereignty. States may exercise sovereignty by exerting their authority in cyber structures located in their territory over persons, including citizens of other States, residing in their sovereign area.^[119]^\n67. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State's capacity to govern activities within its cyberspace borders, including the regulation and control of information flow, data privacy, and cybersecurity.^[120]^ As Yochai Benkler notes in the article \"From Consumers to Users\", cyberspace can be divided into three layers—physical infrastructure, logical infrastructure, and content and application layers.^[121]^ Cyber sovereignty involves a State's ability to assert control\n^[118]^ GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n^[119]^ Google Spain SL v.

The scope of cyber sovereignty encompasses not only territorial jurisdiction but also extraterritorial jurisdiction based on the effects principle. States can assert jurisdiction over cyber activities that have direct and substantial effects within their borders, regardless of where the actions originated.\n69. Violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace occur when one State conducts cyber operations or cyber-attacks that undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of another State. Such violations may involve cyber espionage, data breaches, or cyber warfare, targeting a State's critical infrastructure, government systems, or sensitive information.\n70. The legal implications and scope of using sovereignty in cyberspace should be limited. States have sovereignty over information and communications technology infrastructure within their territory, according to the founding concept of sovereignty. An essential consideration is that the use of sovereignty must not infringe on the sovereignty of another State. This means that the use of ICTs must not jeopardize other States' cyberinfrastructure.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 53\nCyber-attacks on its critical infrastructure threaten State sovereignty and may be seen as evidence of intervention in its territorial sovereignty.\n## III.B. State sovereignty violation: applicable law\n71. There is an increasing need for an international legal framework to address these challenges since traditional forms of State sovereignty are no longer adequate to meet the international character of cyberspace. The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States is one of the keyways that international law is applied to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n72. The principle of non-intervention has been applied to address challenges such as cyber espionage and cyber assaults on State-controlled infrastructure. For example, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack has been deemed a violation of US sovereignty, illustrating how State sovereignty can be encroached upon in cyberspace and how international law can be employed to address such infringements.

Grounded in the principle of non-intervention, the US government responded by imposing sanctions on the DPRK and taking other measures to hold its government accountable. Hacking identified here as a type of cyber intrusion, was attributed by the US government to the DPRK. The US response, including the imposition of penalties, can be seen as an effort to hold the country accountable for its actions and discourage future cyber intrusions. The actions taken by the US also convey a message to other nations that cross-border intrusions will not be tolerated and will be met with a response.\n73. The principle of jurisdiction is another way in which international law applies to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. The power of a State to exercise control over a certain area or individuals is referred to as jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in cyberspace may be a complicated problem since it is not always apparent where a certain cyber-related action is taking place or who is liable for it.\n74. Several revisions and adaptations may be required for the successful application of international law to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. One possible modification would be to explain the application to cyber activities of existing norms of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention. This modification could include the development of new legal interpretations or more detailed guidance on how these principles should be implemented in the context of cyberspace. Another adaptation would be to create new legal tools or soft instruments that explicitly handle violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. A new legally binding document on State sovereignty in cyberspace could be developed by the relevant UN entities to set out explicit norms and principles for the safeguarding of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n75. International law should address the problem of attribution and responsibility or violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. Attribution,\n Ibid.\n Michael N. Schmitt, above n.74, 173; Michael N.

Creating new legal frameworks or principles to meet this challenge may clarify the duties and responsibility of States for cyber-related activities that breach the sovereignty of others.\n## IV. Extraterritorial effects and international law\n76. Having explored the legal matters and relevant laws concerning violations of State sovereignty, another noteworthy aspect pertains to the impact of cyberspace, where multiple principles may come into play, causing cross-border implications. Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities.\n## IV.A. Extraterritorial effects: the legal issue\n77. The principle of extraterritoriality is addressed in the negative rather than the positive context. Typically, any legal action taken by a State impacts the region under its control. At times, the acts of one State may have an impact on the activities of another or within another territory and beyond its legislative jurisdiction.\n78. The question of jurisdiction is a critical one. One of the interesting types of core principles related to extraterritorial effects is the nationality\nWrongful Acts 2001, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, vol. II (part Two), A/56/49 (Vol. I)/Corr.4.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nprinciple. The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location. It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.\n79. In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities. Cyber operations conducted by individuals or entities who are nationals of a particular State may have effects that extend beyond that State's borders, potentially impacting other States and their interests. This raises questions about the application of international law to such cyber operations and whether they may be considered extraterritorial.\n80. The nationality principle serves as a legal basis for States to assert jurisdiction over cyber activities conducted by their nationals, even if the effects of those activities are felt outside their territory. This principle allows States to exercise their regulatory authority and apply their laws to address the potential harm caused by cyber operations carried out by their citizens abroad. By doing so, the nationality principle helps mitigate the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities and provides a means for States to address cyber threats that originate from their nationals.\n81. In connection with the application of international law to cyberspace, the nationality principle can be relevant in determining which State has jurisdiction over specific cyber incidents and whether a State has the right to\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 57\nrespond to cyber operations that have an impact on its interests. This principle helps establish a link between the State and the conduct of its nationals in cyberspace, enabling the State to assert its rights and responsibilities concerning the activities of its citizens in the digital realm. However, the application of the nationality principle in cyberspace can be complex, particularly when cyber operations involve multiple actors and cross-border effects, leading to debates on the scope and limitations of the jurisdiction in the digital domain.\n82. A State’s jurisdiction is typically established by its territorial boundaries in the physical world. However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace. In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor. Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach, and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law. The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n83. Another facet of international law's extraterritorial effects in cyberspace concerns the issue of State responsibility. States have an obligation under international law to avoid interfering with the rights of other States and to compensate victims for their illegal conduct. Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.\n84. There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^[151]^\n85. The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.\n86. Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^[152]^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.\n87. In conclusion, the extraterritorial impacts of domestic law in cyberspace are increasingly complicated and have grown major implications for jurisdiction, State responsibility, extraterritorial application, and human rights. While legal academics and practitioners continue to argue the optimal\n^[151]^ Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, above n.75, 154-158 and 165-167.\n^[152]^ Mireille Hildebrandt, *Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to Enforce in Cyberspace? Bodin, Schmitt, Grotius in Cyberspace*, 63(2) The University of Toronto LJ (2013), 197.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 59\nsolution to these concerns, it is evident that new techniques are required to ensure that international law can successfully govern the digital domain of cyberspace. Many international and regional legislation, policies, and recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.\n## IV.B. Extraterritorial effects: applicable law\n88. Extraterritorial effects in cyberspace have expanded in recent years, as the internet and other digital technologies have enabled individuals and non-State entities to operate beyond national borders.^[153]^ There is an increasing need for international legal frameworks to handle these challenges, as traditional notions of State sovereignty may no longer be adequate, given the global nature of cyberspace.\n89. There are several examples of international law being used to address extraterritorial effects in cyberspace.\n90. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017 is one example of the use of international law.^[154]^ The attack disrupted hospitals, businesses, and government agencies in over 150 countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers. Many States and cybersecurity experts blamed the hack on the DPRK's government.^[155]^ The UN Security Council (UNSC) has passed several resolutions and issued statements on cyber security and international law, including UNSC Resolution 2341 (2017), which recognizes\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nthe growing use of ICTs and the need for collective action to address the challenges posed by their malicious use. The UNSC has also underscored the need for States to work together to address the extraterritorial implications of cyber operations like the WannaCry attack and to combat cybercrime and the proliferation of malicious cyber tools.\n91. Another example is the Stuxnet worm. As mentioned above, the worm, identified in 2010, was developed to target and disrupt the control systems of industrial facilities, notably nuclear sites in Iran. While the identity of the attacker is not explicitly stated, it is important to note that Iran has its perspective on the origin of the attack. The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities. International law is applicable to this incident, offering a framework for the extraterritorial effects of action in cyberspace. As previously stated, the UN Charter, especially the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality, prohibits States from asserting jurisdiction over another State’s territory without its consent.\n92. The existing international legal system provides a framework for dealing with extraterritoriality in cyberspace, but it is not without constraints. The UN Charter’s principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality offer a basis for doing so, but due to the unique character of cyberspace, such as the difficulties in determining the origin and responsibility of a cyber-related action, applying these principles can be problematic. Uncertainty and the\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 61\nabsence of defined norms and principles for applying international law in cyberspace might make it difficult for States to address extraterritoriality effectively. A State’s reaction to extraterritorial impacts like cyber espionage and cyber-attacks might also be hampered by a lack of agreement on how to interpret and implement international law in cyberspace.\n93. Overcoming these limitations requires that the existing international legal framework for cyberspace be maintained and strengthened. This can be accomplished by negotiating new legally enforceable instruments, such as draft articles on State jurisdiction over cyber activities, or by developing soft law instruments, such as guidelines or recommendations. States should also continue to collaborate to build shared understandings and norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace; this can aid in clarifying the application of international law in this setting.\n## V. Cyberspace sovereignty and international law\n94. This section represents the core legal concern pertaining to the applicability of international law in the realm of cyberspace. It explores the progressive matter of cyberspace sovereignty, a subject that is infrequently examined within a broader framework. Within this section, the notion of cyberspace sovereignty is introduced, along with its associated legal intricacies, while also addressing how international law could potentially be relevant in navigating this novel domain of sovereignty.\n## V.A. Cyberspace sovereignty: the legal issue\n95. Sovereignty is traditionally understood as a territorial concept, entailing a State’s exclusive control over its territory, populace, and domestic affairs. On the other hand, jurisdiction expands beyond territorial borders\n---\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nand encompasses various principles, including the nationality principle, which grants States authority over their citizens regardless of their location. In the digital era, the emergence of cyberspace has introduced new challenges, leading to the notion of cyber sovereignty, where States assert control over the virtual realm.\n96. Sovereignty, rooted in the Westphalian system, is the bedrock of international law, emphasizing a State’s exclusive control within its territorial boundaries. It entails the supreme authority of a State over its domestic affairs, encompassing governance, laws, and enforcement mechanisms. Traditionally, sovereignty was a territorial concept, asserting that a State has the right to govern its territory and protect its national interests.\n97. Yochai Benkler’s Three-Layer Internet Model presents a theoretical framework for understanding the evolving structure of the internet. The model encompasses three distinct layers: the physical infrastructure layer, the logical layer, and the content layer. The physical infrastructure layer involves the tangible hardware and network components that enable data transmission. The logical layer involves the protocols and standards that govern data transmission, while the content layer comprises the information, data, and services accessible to users.\n98. As the internet has become an essential part of modern societies, States have sought to assert control over cyberspace, giving rise to the concept of cyber sovereignty. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State’s desire and efforts to assert control and regulation over the virtual realm, including internet access, content, and data flow within its borders. While cyberspace transcends\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 63\nphysical borders, States increasingly assert control over online activities within their territory, reflecting their quest for digital governance.\n99. The functioning of cyberspace does not rely upon a single ICT infrastructure in one territory; rather, it requires extensive cooperation and interconnection with other ICT infrastructures globally. Cyberspace is a borderless and interconnected domain that operates across multiple jurisdictions, and its seamless functioning depends on the collaboration between different countries and their respective ICT systems. The Internet, as a core component of cyberspace, is a network of networks that spans the globe, and each network’s smooth operation is interdependent on the functioning of others. This interconnection ensures data transfer, communication, and accessibility across borders, facilitating the exchange of information and services on a global scale.\n100. Cooperation among various stakeholders is crucial in maintaining the stability and functionality of cyberspace. Governments, private companies, internet service providers, and technical organisations work together to develop and implement technical standards, policies, and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet and cyberspace. Additionally, international agreements and treaties facilitate cooperation on issues such as cybersecurity, data protection, and intellectual property rights. This collaborative approach fosters an inclusive and interconnected cyberspace, ensuring that it remains a valuable and essential tool for communication, innovation, and economic growth on a global scale.\n(Council on Foreign Relations, 30 October 2019) (https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty); Anqi Wang, Cyber Sovereignty at Its Boldest: A Chinese Perspective, 16(2) The Ohio State Technology Law Journal (2020), 403-417.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n101. In cyberspace, the involvement of non-State actors plays a significant role in shaping its governance and technical aspects. One notable example of a non-State actor in cyberspace governance is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF is a global community of experts, engineers, and researchers who develop and promote voluntary standards and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP). This open and collaborative organization operates independently of any government and allows various stakeholders to contribute to the development and maintenance of internet standards.\n102. The IETF’s role in shaping the technical foundations of cyberspace exemplifies the influence of non-State actors in the functioning of the digital realm. As an inclusive and decentralized organisation, the IETF invites contributions from individuals, academics, private sector entities, and governments, ensuring a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance. While State actors also participate in the IETF’s discussions, its decision-making processes are transparent and open to all, allowing non-State actors to have a meaningful impact on the development and evolution of internet standards. This involvement of non-State actors in shaping cyberspace underscores the dynamic and diverse nature of governance in the digital age.\n103. Beyond the jurisdiction of States, the functioning of the internet is partially controlled by various entities, both governmental and non-governmental, operating in the cyberspace arena. One significant non-governmental entity that exerts influence over internet governance is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is responsible for managing and coordinating the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses. This coordination ensures the stable and secure functioning of the internet, and it is\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 65\nconducted through a multi-stakeholder model involving diverse stakeholders from different countries and sectors.\n104. In addition to ICANN, various private technology corporations, such as major internet service providers and tech giants, hold significant control over the functioning of the internet beyond State jurisdiction. These corporations own and operate vast portions of the internet infrastructure, including data centers, communication networks, and cloud computing services. Their actions and policies can have far-reaching impacts on the accessibility, privacy, and security of cyberspace. Furthermore, some technology companies have been involved in content moderation and censorship decisions, which can influence the free flow of information on the internet. The multi-faceted involvement of both non-governmental organizations like ICANN and private corporations in shaping the functioning of the internet highlights the complex and evolving landscape of cyberspace sovereignty.\n105. Activities in cyberspace might have an impact on sovereignty and have extraterritorial effects. However, some propose separating cyberspace from domestic law, as Chinese President Xi Jinping did when emphasizing the idea of cyber sovereignty. In general discussions of jurisdiction, the\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nterritory is defined as the area in which States can exercise their sovereignty. A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n106. Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).\nCyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.\n107. The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.\n108. Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace. There are a few international agreements and conventions dealing with\nCreemers, China’s Conception of Cyber Sovereignty: Rhetoric and Realization, in: Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg, Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (2020), 107-144; Binxing Fang, above n.73, v.\n Binxing Fang, above n.73, 78.\n Ibid., 84.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 67\ninternet issues, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the UN Cybercrime treaty, but a clear consensus on how these agreements should be universally applied to the unique dynamics of cyberspace is lacking.\n109. It is possible to argue that ICT threats may have consequences ranging from State sovereignty to cyberspace sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty in international law is significant because sovereignty in relation to territories, populations, and regimes inside its territory is relevant to cyberspace.\n110. In the context of cyber operations, the Three-Layer Internet Model aids in understanding the implications of different activities on State sovereignty. Low-level cyber operations, such as passive information gathering, may not necessarily violate sovereignty, as they do not involve significant intrusion or disruption. However, high-level cyber operations, like cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure or disinformation campaigns, can directly challenge a State's sovereignty by jeopardizing its ability to govern and protect its population.\n111. The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations. Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain. For instance, China's Great Firewall exemplifies a cyber sovereignty approach, where the State enforces strict controls over internet access and content to maintain political stability.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n112. The concepts of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and cyber sovereignty represent distinct layers of authority in the digital age. Sovereignty remains anchored in territorial control, jurisdiction extends beyond borders, and cyber sovereignty emerges as States grapple with regulating the virtual realm. Understanding the implications of different cyber operations on State sovereignty is crucial for crafting effective cyber policies and fostering international cooperation in the digital era. By incorporating the Three-Layer Internet Model, policymakers can navigate the complexities of cyberspace and strike a balance between safeguarding sovereignty and fostering an open and secure global Internet environment.\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n113. International law applies to cyberspace sovereignty in several ways, primarily. One of the primary means is through the principle of State sovereignty, which affirms the ability of States to govern and control their territory. This argument is used to explain States' regulation and control of the internet within their borders, which includes the capacity to restrict or prohibit certain websites, manage online material, and respond to cyber threats emanating from within their borders.\n114. Another way international law applies to internet sovereignty is through the principle of non-intervention in other States' internal affairs. This principle is employed to defend governments' capacity to respond to cyber threats that originate beyond their borders, such as through defensive cyber operations or the imposition of penalties against foreign entities.\n115. International treaties and agreements also allow the application of international law to cyberspace sovereignty. The ICCPR, for example,\nterpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways); Jessica Baron, Cyber-Sovereignty and China's Great Firewall: An Interview With James Griffiths (Forbes, 8 April 2019) (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2019/04/08/cyber-sovereignty-and-chinas-great-firewall-an-interview-with-james-griffiths/?sh=2c0c9a43747b).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 69\nrecognizes the right to free expression and the prohibition of arbitrary intervention with privacy, both of which are relevant in cyberspace.\n116. The ICCPR, one of the most important international instruments for protecting human rights online, has direct relevance to the issue of cyberspace sovereignty. Article 19 of the ICCPR preserves the right to free speech and prohibits arbitrary privacy infringements. These rights are directly relevant to cyberspace since they safeguard people’s capacity to access and distribute information online without intervention from authorities. The ICCPR also acknowledges the right to peaceful assembly, which applies to online gatherings such as demonstrations and social media campaigns. Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful intervention with privacy, which is directly relevant to cyberspace. The right to privacy includes the right to have personal data protected and is especially important in the internet environment, where massive amounts of personal data are gathered, kept, and shared.\n117. International treaties like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) establish frameworks for dealing with cybercrime. The BCC is an important international mechanism for the application of\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\ninternational law to the topic of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs. This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n118. The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders. The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software. This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence, allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.\n119. Despite the existence of the BCC, the absence of direct legislation for cyberspace creates challenges. The international legal system, guided by principles such as State sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States, lacks a well-defined framework to handle the complexities of cyberspace. While the UN Charter and other international agreements, which touch upon issues of sovereignty and self-defense, can be invoked to legitimize State actions safeguarding national security interests in cyberspace, they\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71\ndo not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.\n120. Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply.\n## VI. Conclusion\n121. In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.\n122. The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.\n123. The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain. The Tallinn Manual, a legal guide on the\nChinese JIL (2024)\napplication of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.\n124. Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.\n125. While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked.\n Michael N.

These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away.

First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States.² It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system,³ might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited.⁴ The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals.⁵ The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism.

Principle of State sovereignty",
        "38": "Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory.[66] This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace.[67] It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters.[68] Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines.[69] It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders.[70] In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal. Thus, differentiating sovereignty and jurisdiction holds key 64 UN General Assembly, above n.8, 2; UN HRC, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (Human Rights Council, 14 July 2014), UN Doc.

        "39": "There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.",
        "40": "The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means. 71 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b). 72 Ibid.; Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, Application of International Law to Cyberspace: Summary of Israel's Approach (25 October 2021) (https://embassies.gov.il/UnGeneva/prioritiesstatements/ScienceTechnologyDevelopment/Pages/Israel-approach-on-the-Application-of-International-Law-to-Cyberspace.aspx). 73 Binxing Fang, Cyberspace Sovereignty: Reflections on Building a Community of Common Future in Cyberspace (2018), 78; UN Charter, art. 2, para.1; The German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, On the Application of International Law in Cyberspace (2021), 2-3; Michael N.

        "41": "First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.",
        "42": "Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78",
        "43": "Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.",
        "44": "To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported. 75 Michael N.

        "45": "The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law.⁸⁰ It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention.⁸¹ It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.",
        "46": "Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives.⁸² Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions.⁸³ Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.⁸⁴",

Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. $^{86}$ Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. $^{87}$",

        "50": "In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States. ## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force",
        "51": "The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war.⁹¹ It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,⁹² it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations. The GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that, in their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.⁹³ Thus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain⁹⁴ as they inherently cause harm in two distinct 90 Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations as a Use of Force, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 297, 538. 91 UN Charter, art. 2(4). 92 Ibid. 93 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(d). 94 Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, above n.72; the German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, above n.73, 6; Foreign, Chinese JIL (2024) ways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties.⁹⁵ It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.",
        "52": "Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains.⁹⁶ For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus⁹⁷ to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS).⁹⁸ The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges.⁹⁹ The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace.

A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force.¹⁰⁰ Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.¹⁰¹",

        "57": "The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain.

There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty.

Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities. ## IV.A.

The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location.¹⁴⁰ It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.¹⁴¹",
        "79": "In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities.

However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace.¹⁴⁷ In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor.¹⁴⁸ Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach,¹⁴⁹ and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law.¹⁵⁰ The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects. 145 Darrel C Menthe, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace: A Theory of International Spaces, 1 Michigan Telecommunications and Technology LR (1998), 71-73, 97-100. 146 Ibid.; Maxron Holder, Cyberspace in a State of Flux: Regulating Cyberspace through International Law, 9(2) Groningen JIL (2022), 266, 273-274, 277. 147 Michael N.

Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.",
        "84": "There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^[151]^",
        "85": "The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.",
        "86": "Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^[152]^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.",

The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities.

A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.",
        "106": "Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as a natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).¹⁸⁷ Cyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.¹⁸⁸",
        "107": "The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.",
        "108": "Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace.

        "111": "The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations.¹⁹⁴ Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain.

Chinese JIL (2024) international law to the topic of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs.²⁰⁶ This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.",
        "118": "The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime.²⁰⁷ Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders.²⁰⁸ The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software.²⁰⁹ This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence,²¹⁰ allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.",
        "119": "Despite the existence of the BCC, the absence of direct legislation for cyberspace creates challenges. The international legal system, guided by principles such as State sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States, lacks a well-defined framework to handle the complexities of cyberspace. While the UN Charter and other international agreements, which touch upon issues of sovereignty and self-defense,²¹¹ can be invoked to legitimize State actions safeguarding national security interests in cyberspace, they 206 Ibid., art. 22. 207 Ibid., arts. 23-27. 208 Ibid. 209 Ibid., arts. 7-8. 210 Ibid., arts. 20-21. 211 UN Charter, art. 51. Chatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71 do not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.",
        "120": "Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply. ## VI. Conclusion",
        "121": "In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.",
        "122": "The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.",
        "123": "The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain. The Tallinn Manual, a legal guide on the Chinese JIL (2024) application of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.²¹²",
        "124": "Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.",
        "125": "While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked. ²¹² Michael N.

Cyber-attacks targeting key infrastructure can undermine sovereignty by aiding another State's territorial control. The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.\n# I. Introduction\n1. In the realm of modern digital interactions, envision yourself sitting at your computer, immersed in your daily routine when an email notification grabs your attention. The sender appears to be your trusted bank, urgently notifying you of an account issue and providing a link to rectify the situation. Intrigued and slightly concerned, you click on the link, inadvertently divulging your sensitive information on what turns out to be a fraudulent website. Unbeknownst to you, you have fallen victim to a shrewd cybercriminal tactic known as email phishing.\n2. This scenario of email phishing serves as a tangible example, one that resonates with countless individuals, of the pervasive nature of information and communication technology (ICT) threats. These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away. Thus, combating these modern perils necessitates a collaborative, global strategy that supersedes conventional territorial limits—a manifestation of how sovereignty has evolved in the digital age.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 27\n3. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a surge in ICT utilization for remote operations, has accentuated the pivotal role of these technologies. While ICT empowers States, businesses, and individuals, its rapid advancement has also brought forth intricacies and concerns that ripple far beyond national frontiers. The interconnectedness facilitated by these technologies underscores the importance of grappling with the evolving concept of sovereignty, as we navigate an increasingly borderless digital landscape.\n4. “ICT threats” are malicious uses of ICTs perpetrated by both State and non-State actors with a significant impact on a variety of factors. ICT threats can be divided into three categories. First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States. It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system, might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited. The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals. The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism. This issue has the potential to threaten international safety and security.\n5. Despite these issues, there is currently no special international legislation dealing with ICT risks, notably State-sponsored cyber threats. Thus far, the only efforts to address such government operations have involved the application of existing international law, including the prohibition on the use of\n1. UN General Assembly, Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security [GGE 2021 Report] (14 July 2021), UN Doc. A/76/135, paras.6-14.\n2. Ibid., para.8.\n3. Ibid., para.10.\n4. Ibid.\n5. Ibid., para.9.\n6. Ibid., paras.13-14.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nforce under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, the customary international law principles of non-intervention, sovereignty, State responsibility and countermeasures, international human rights law, such as Human Rights Council Resolution 20/8 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). However, some of these laws and regulations do not apply effectively to the State’s conduct in cyberspace. In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security. The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace. Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace. Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n6. Some regional laws address cyber-related issues. For example, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) initiated by the Council of Europe, regulates collaboration among parties in the protection of the community against cybercrime, by harmonizing domestic law, improving investigative procedures, and boosting cooperation among member States. The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection has not yet come into force. It aims to establish a credible framework for cybersecurity in Africa by organizing electronic transactions, protecting personal data, promoting cybersecurity, e-governance and combating cybercrime.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 29\n7. In a narrower context, several international organizations have also come forward to acknowledge the current state of international law as applied to cyberspace. For example, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 73/266 supports the use of ICT for peaceful purposes, calls for the prevention of the conflict caused by ICT usage, and the provision of education on advancements in the field of ICTs in the context of international security. The European Union (EU) has examined and exchanged views on worldwide cyber security challenges; such efforts have expedited collaboration among EU member States, including diplomatic collaboration and the development of cyber diplomacy skills and an EU Cybersecurity Strategy. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also adopted a crucial strategy document on 28 January 2021, the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025), which is intended to protect against cyberspace threats and assist the digital economy and community. This is only a strategy document and is not legally enforceable.\n8. This research article has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the nature of international law in cyberspace and how it impacts State sovereignty, leading to cross-border consequences. The second goal is to examine how the application of international law to cyberspace has contributed to the growth of cyberspace sovereignty. It seeks to address three key questions: First, do non-physical ICT threats violate the sovereignty of other States? If so, to what extent does current international law apply to such threats? Second, can domestic cyberspace laws have cross-border effects, and to what\nPure Sovereignty in Cyberspace, 5 February 2024 (https://opiniojuris.org/2024/02/05/the-african-union-rightly-endorses-pure-sovereignty-in-cyberspace/).\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nextent? And third, does the principle of cyberspace sovereignty exist, and how does it compare to the principle of territorial sovereignty?\n9. This research article is structured into four primary sections. The initial section offers an overview of ICT threats and their interplay with international law, examining the existence of such threats, and their legal implications for States, and providing insights into international law within the cyberspace context. It examines principles such as State sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force within the cyberspace context. Subsequently, the following section highlights a critical concern—State sovereignty violation. It elucidates the key legal issues and relevant applicable laws. Moreover, the subsequent part delves into the intricate matter of extraterritorial effects in cyberspace, exploring the associated legal complexities and applicable legal frameworks. Lastly, the concluding section investigates the emerging realm of cyberspace sovereignty and its interaction with international law. By analyzing these multifaceted dimensions, this research aims to enhance comprehension of the evolving legal landscape within cyberspace and underscore the necessity for comprehensive international regulations.\n## II. Overview of ICT threats in international law\n10. This section presents an overview of the threats posed by ICT from the perspective of international law. The existence of ICT risks is becoming increasingly threatening. This section is divided into two subsections: (1) the existence of ICT risks and the legal effects on States and (2) international law in cyberspace. The first briefly highlights the nature of ICT threats and the risk they pose to international security and stability, economic and social growth, security, and individual well-being. The other subsection presents an overview of existing international law relevant to cyberspace as a foundation for how current international law might be applied to challenges posed by ICT threats.\n## II.A. Existence of ICT threats and legal effects on States\n11. The challenges of addressing ICT threats are not new and have received considerable attention. The GGE on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security was established in 2011 to assess actual and prospective dangers, and to address issues of ICT use impacting the international community and the\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 31\nrisks that it may be used in a manner inconsistent with the preservation of international stability and security. This would gravely jeopardize the integrity of the State and individual infrastructure. Following that, additional meetings were conducted to address the existence of ICT dangers, which may be described as follows.\n12. The malicious use of ICT presents a complex and evolving challenge, encompassing cyberattacks, data breaches and other cyber threats that transcend borders and undermine State sovereignty. Beyond immediate material harm, these activities have far-reaching societal, economic, and geopolitical consequences, necessitating a comprehensive response that combines technical solutions, legal frameworks, and international cooperation. Addressing malicious ICT use requires ongoing innovation and collaboration to ensure a secure digital environment for individuals, businesses, and governments.\n13. ICT threats, broadly defined as the intentional and malicious use of information technology, which can be orchestrated by State or non-State actors. The characterization of activities as ICT threats may vary geographically, yet their consequences have global implications. However, the classification of activities as ICT threats necessitates adherence to specific criteria.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nThese criteria include the potential to pose a significant risk to international security and stability, as well as to economic and social growth, and human safety and well-being. While instances of ICT misuse may not uniformly impact international security and stability, they might be driven by political or other motives.\n14. Characteristics of malicious ICT usage may appear in many circumstances, for example, ICT is used aggressively to achieve military goals. This form of ICT activity has the potential to be utilized as a tool or weapon in future wars between States.\n15. Second, such acts may be used to wage abusive information campaigns to impact the processes, systems, and general stability of other States and may directly or indirectly impact individuals.\n16. Third, ICT activities can cause harm to essential infrastructure supporting services at the national, regional, or international levels. The critical information infrastructure targeted and subject to critical assaults includes essential public services, especially critical technological infrastructure on the internet, and businesses in the health sector. Information concerning a person's health is highly sensitive and vulnerable, as has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n17. Fourth, ICT might be employed for terrorist reasons. Such actions might involve the direct use of ICT for terrorism or troop allocation. The use of ICT to provide financial assistance, training, and promotion and the act of assaulting ICT infrastructure are all examples of unlawful ICT usage.\n18. Misuse of ICT can be classified according to the technique, procedure, and method employed; for example, cyber-attack, cyber espionage, cybercrime, or cyberterrorism all constitute forms of misuse. However, this article does not go into detail regarding each category and only a brief overview of these ICT threats is provided.\n19. In the realm of modern warfare and national security, the terminologies of cyber operations and cyber-attacks have gained prominence in military\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 33\nmanuals of various States, including the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). However, these concepts are not unique to the UK and the US; other nations also define and address them in their military doctrines. For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare. Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.\n20. In the UK military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the planning and synchronization of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of maneuver and to achieve military objectives.” On the other hand, cyber-attacks are considered a subset of cyber operations and are described as “leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defense’s logistic capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life. As such, a cyberattack could have comparable effects to a physical attack.” Similarly, in the US military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace”, whereas cyber-attacks represent “actions taken in cyberspace that create noticeable denial effects (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) in cyberspace or\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nmanipulation that leads to denial that appears in a physical domain, and is considered a form of fires\".36\n21. The distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks is of utmost significance, as it delineates the varying intents and implications associated with these concepts. In the US military manual, cyber-attacks are regarded as akin to the use of force, thereby connecting them to the principle of self-defense under international law.37 This perspective suggests that cyber-attacks can potentially cause significant harm, prompting responses within the framework of traditional armed conflicts.38 However, it is important to note that this viewpoint is specific to the US, and not all States universally agree with this classification. Conversely, cyber operations encompass a broader spectrum of activities in cyberspace, covering not only offensive and defensive actions but also non-kinetic operations.39 These may include intelligence gathering, disruption of enemy communications, or the safeguarding of critical infrastructure. The broader definition of cyber operations underscores that not all activities in cyberspace are tantamount to cyber-attacks.\n22. Given the unique attributes of cyberspace, the distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks becomes even more complex. The fluidity and virtual nature of cyberspace blur traditional boundaries, making it challenging to pinpoint the location or source of certain actions.40 This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors, including State and non-State entities, to perpetrate cyber-attacks while concealing their identity and intent.41 The difficulty in attribution poses a significant challenge in terms of international legal frameworks and responses to cyber incidents.\n23. The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates the development of comprehensive strategies to address the nuances of cyber operations and\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 35\ncyber-attacks effectively. States are increasingly recognizing the importance of bolstering their cyber capabilities and establishing robust cyber defense mechanisms. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation and information-sharing to counter cyber threats collectively. However, divergent national perspectives and varying thresholds for response have led to debates about how to effectively regulate and govern cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n24. Various forms of cyber operations represent distinct levels of intrusion into computer networks and systems, making them essential factors in evaluating violations of State sovereignty. Among these cyber operations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and malware are prominent examples. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Such attacks do not necessarily breach the target’s network but can disrupt critical services and impact a nation’s ability to function effectively in cyberspace. For example, the deployment of DDoS attacks against Estonia in 2007 had a tremendous impact on the country’s internet infrastructure.\n25. A cyber-attack is commonly defined as any activity aimed at degrading the functionality of a computer network for a political or national security objective. This is evident in incidents that is previously mentioned when the Estonia fell victim to DDoS attacks, highlighting how cyber-attacks can intertwine political goal. While the primary focus is on activities with political or national security objectives, it is important to acknowledge that cyber\n William Banks, Cyber Attribution and State Responsibility, 97 International Law Studies (2021), 1065; European Commission, Cyber: towards stronger EU capabilities for effective operational cooperation, solidarity and resilience, Press Release, 18 April 2023 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2243); Matt Kucik, How State and Local Governments Can Bolster their Cyber Defenses, Tenable, 24 May 2022 (https://pt-br.tenable.com/blog/how-state-and-local-governments-can-bolster-their-cyber-defenses).\n U.

Singer and Allan Friedman, ibid., 125.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nactivities may serve various purposes, extending beyond political motivations. The term “cyber operations” could serve as a more encompassing umbrella, covering a range of activities in cyberspace, from intelligence gathering to disruptive operations. The absence of a uniform cluster-definition in international law to differentiate between these activities highlights a challenge, and the regulation of such activities may require a detailed and careful approach, accounting for the diversity of cyber operations.\n26. Malware, on the other hand, refers to malicious software designed to infiltrate and compromise computer systems. It can range from ransomware, which encrypts valuable data until a ransom is paid, to advanced persistent threats (APTs) capable of clandestinely maintaining long-term access to targeted systems. These forms of cyber operations pose significant challenges to the affected States, as they can lead to data breaches, economic losses, and even the manipulation of critical infrastructure.\n27. Recent cyber incidents have demonstrated the varying degrees of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. The 2020 SolarWinds attack, a sophisticated supply-chain compromise, involved the insertion of a backdoor into the software update of SolarWinds, a widely used IT management tool. The attackers targeted various government and private organizations, including sensitive government agencies, marking a high level of intrusion into critical systems.\n What is malware?: Malware or malicious software definition, Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware); What is malware?, CISCO (https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/what-is-malware.html).\n What is an APT, Imperva (https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/apt-advanced-persistent-threat/); Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Attacks’, Cynet (https://www.cynet.com/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-attacks/).\n Saheed Oladimeji and Sean Michael Kerner, SolarWinds hack explained: Everything you need to know, TechTarget, 2023 (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know); Isabella Jibilian and Katie Canales, The US is readying sanctions against Russia over the SolarWinds cyber attack.

Similarly, the interference in the 2016 US presidential election revealed the potential for cyber operations to influence political processes. State-sponsored actors leveraged phishing attacks to gain access to political organizations' networks, stole sensitive data, and conducted disinformation campaigns. This intrusion highlighted the impact of cyber operations on a nation's democratic processes and raised concerns about safeguarding sovereignty and electoral integrity.\n29. These examples underscore the significance of understanding the varying levels of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. Assessing the violation of State sovereignty in cyberspace necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the techniques, tools, and intentions behind cyber operations. Moreover, international cooperation and robust cybersecurity measures are imperative to safeguard States from cyber threats that have the potential to disrupt vital functions, compromise national security, and infringe upon sovereignty.\n30. Cyber espionage may take several forms. It can be physical, for example, where code is placed into hardware to restrict access from a stream, or it might rely on cable channels. It might leverage the spread of malware to control communication flows or take a more sophisticated form, such as phishing, to acquire access and modify data.\n31. Cybercrimes are crimes perpetrated in cyberspace by employing various technological instruments, such as assaults on computer systems to damage\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\ncyberinfrastructure. Cybercrimes are acts that jeopardize the trust, integrity, and availability of computer data or systems, such as unauthorized access, interception, or acquisition of computer data, or illegal intervention. They can constitute fraud, unlawful copyright, or trademark activity, hate speech, or the transmission of illegal or infringing personal information directed at persons or financial information.\n32. Finally, cyberterrorism refers to the utilization of computer network technologies with the intent to disrupt critical national infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and government operations, or to coerce and instill fear in a government or civilian population. The spectrum of cyberterrorism activities encompasses propaganda, financial manipulation, training, planning, or execution of cyber-attacks.\n## II.B. Overview of international law in cyberspace\n33. Misuse of ICT necessarily has consequences for the State, particularly in legal terms. The first and most important legal impact concerns State sovereignty. The action constituting an ICT threat differs in nature from conventional actions or omissions such as the use of the military to violate the territorial integrity of other States by deploying weapons, or interfering with or influencing politics. The nature of harmful applications of ICT is not\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 39\nphysical and may not include the element of physical intrusion on another State’s territory. It might take the shape of internet acts involving acts outside the State.\n34. Despite the absence of physical intrusion, cyber-attacks can influence the State, raising questions about their classification under traditional international law concepts like Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Assessing the effectiveness of a weapon, including cyber-attacks, may involve considering the harm caused. Furthermore, ICT misuse could amount to intervention in the internal affairs of other States, invoking the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, which are foundational in international law.\n35. The complexities surrounding the integration of international law into cyberspace constitute a dynamic challenge that has recently attracted the interest of scholars, policymakers, and practitioners. One of the most challenging aspects of applying international law to cyberspace is that it is a virtual rather than a physical domain. The anonymity and transnational character of cyberspace operations make it difficult to place responsibility for cyber incidents on individual participants.\n Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace: Sovereignty Redux?, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 22-23.\n Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 11; Corfu Channel, Separate Opinion of Judge Alvarez, ICJ Reports 1949, 43; Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970 containing the Declaration of Principles of International Law, Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, UN Doc.

Blank and Patrick D.

Ross Jr, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations (2020), 401; Ron Ross et al., Developing Cyber-Resilient Systems: A Systems Security Engineering Approach (2021), 62.\nChinese JIL (2024)\n36. Despite these challenges, experts and practitioners are increasingly in agreement that existing international law applies to cyberspace. According to the Human Rights Council and GGE, “the same rights that States have offline must also be protected online”[64] and that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the UN, is applicable and is essential for ensuring peace and security in the online environment.”[65]\n37. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that the core concepts of international law, such as State sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention, apply equally to the cyber domain. Therefore, this section discusses three key principles of international law: the principle of State sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, and the principle of prohibition of the use of force.\n## II.B.i. Principle of State sovereignty\n38. Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory.[66] This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace.[67] It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters.[68] Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines.[69] It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders.[70] In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal. Thus, differentiating sovereignty and jurisdiction holds key\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 41\nimportance in discerning cyber sovereignty's extent, given its control over cross-border cyber activities.\n39. There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.\n40. The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n41. First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n42. Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78\n43. Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.\n44. To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 43\n## II.B.ii. Principle of non-intervention\n45. The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law. It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention. It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.\n46. Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives. Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions. Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.\n47. Coercion, however, extends beyond mere pressure by involving threats or forceful actions that limit a State’s choices and significantly reduce its\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nautonomy. $^{85}$ While distinguishing between pressure and coercion can sometimes be subtle, the key factor is the degree to which a State's sovereignty is eroded, and its capacity for independent decision-making is curtailed. Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. $^{86}$ Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. $^{87}$\n48. Intervention in cyberspace is another main priority of the GGE; the State should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. $^{88}$ According to the GGE report, States shall not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including using ICTs, in conformity with the principle of non-intervention. $^{89}$ The following considerations shape the use of the term \"coercion\" in non-intervention principles, and the term can be interpreted to describe a wide range of cyberspace activities.\n49. Furthermore, States must respect the sovereignty of other States by refraining from cyber activities that might violate another State's territorial\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 45\nintegrity, including initiating a cyber-attack against another’s critical infrastructure or military systems or launching a cyber-attack against another’s territory.\n50. In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States.\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n51. The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war. It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations, it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations.\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that,\nin their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.\nThus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain as they inherently cause harm in two distinct\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties. It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n52. Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains. For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS). The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges. The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace. It also emphasizes the importance of States developing norms and legislation for responsible State behavior in that realm.\nCommonwealth &amp; Development Office, Application of international law to states’ conduct in cyberspace: UK statement (UK: Policy Paper, 3 June 2021) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement); HM Government, National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021 (2016) (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf).\n Michael N.

Broad, et al., above n.97.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 47\n53. Other scholars argue that the unique characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to apply the use of force principle in the same manner as in other domains. Rather, they claim that cyber operations that do not result in physical harm or loss of life are a type of coercion that falls short of force. A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force. Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.\n54. The use of ICT in the cyber domain, as stated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, arises from the fact that certain cyber activities can cause damage in two distinct ways.\n55. Firstly, traditional exercises of physical force typically involve the direct application of kinetic energy, resulting in visible and tangible destruction. However, cyber operations can also cause significant harm and destruction through non-kinetic means, such as disrupting critical infrastructure, compromising sensitive data, and disabling essential services. In the cyber domain, the use of force is not limited to physical impact but can manifest in various ways that may lead to severe consequences. For instance, cyberattacks targeting vital systems like power grids, financial institutions, or communication networks can disrupt the functioning of an entire nation, resulting in significant casualties and economic losses.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n56. Second, cyber activities may have cascading effects, leading to a domino effect of disruptions and harm that extends far beyond the initial target. For instance, a cyber operation aimed at disabling a country's military communication network could inadvertently impact civilian communication systems, compromising public safety and welfare. The interconnected nature of digital infrastructure amplifies the potential damage and casualties resulting from cyber operations.\n57. The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and play an increasingly crucial role in international affairs, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable behavior and defining the thresholds for the use of force in the cyber domain remains a pressing challenge for the international community.\n58. A new interpretation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force may be needed to account for the features of cyberspace and guarantee the principle's application to this domain. As previously stated, the anonymity of actors and the lack of physical damage in cyberspace make applying the conventional understanding of the use of force difficult. Furthermore, because there is no clear international consensus on how to define the use of force in the cyber domain, States may have differing views of what constitutes a use of force in the cyber domain. A new interpretation of the use of force\nindustry compare when it comes to the financial loss exposure of cyber threats? (World Economic Forum, 7 May 2023) (https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/how-does-your-industry-compare-when-it-comes-to-the-financial-impact-of-cyber-threats/).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 49\nprinciple in the Charter might guarantee it is relevance to cyberspace and its consistent and predictable application.\n59. Alternatively, new international rules specific to cyberspace may be required to solve the issues particular to that domain. For example, the Tallinn Manuals, which define new norms and principles of State behavior in cyberspace, might offer clarity on how existing international law relates to online environments. New international treaties or conventions addressing the use of force in cyberspace could offer a more complete and explicit framework to guide State behavior in this domain.\n60. To conclude, while the application of international law to cyberspace is a complicated and dynamic matter, there is growing consensus that existing law is relevant. There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty. Furthermore, the ongoing debate over the use of force in cyberspace highlights the need for additional clarity and legal frameworks to control State behavior in this sphere.\n61. Other international law not addressed in this article includes the principle of State responsibility, international human rights and humanitarian law. For the sake of being concise, this section does not address these in any depth.\n## III. State sovereignty violation and international law\n62. The legal complexities in the cyberspace domain can be examined through diverse lenses, shaped by the application of laws to actions occurring within this digital realm. This section delves into pivotal issues encompassing the modern enforcement of international law in the cyberspace arena, commencing with the breach of State sovereignty and the pertinent questions\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nregarding the applicability of international legal principles to the cyber environment.\n## III.A. State sovereignty violation: the legal issue\n63. While jurisdiction is a vital component of sovereignty, it is not always territorially bound. In the context of cyberspace, where borders become blurred and the virtual world extends beyond physical boundaries, a clear distinction between these two principles becomes crucial. This discussion aims to analyze the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty, emphasizing their distinct scopes and implications, particularly in the context of cyber sovereignty and potential violations of State sovereignty.\n64. Sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international law that requires States to employ and restrict the extent of their activities within their sovereign territory while not infringing on the sovereignty of other States. The notion of “territory” is legal and political and applies to geographical or physical areas. The scope of any State’s sovereignty in respect of its territory may be enlarged to cover regions that, while not geographical or physical, have a legal component.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 51\n65. Given the present international rules applicable to cyberspace, the unlawful use of ICT can infringe on other States' sovereignty. One significant issue for international law's applicability to cyberspace is whether it can be enforced within a State's territory.\n66. The GGE study recognized that international law is applicable, maintaining that the UN Charter and the principle of State sovereignty can be applied in cyberspace. The Group reaffirms that\nState sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by states of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory. Existing obligations under international law are applicable to states' ICT-related activity.^[118]^\nThis demonstrates that ICT-related acts, even when not undertaken on another State's territory, can infringe on another State's sovereignty. States may exercise sovereignty by exerting their authority in cyber structures located in their territory over persons, including citizens of other States, residing in their sovereign area.^[119]^\n67. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State's capacity to govern activities within its cyberspace borders, including the regulation and control of information flow, data privacy, and cybersecurity.^[120]^ As Yochai Benkler notes in the article \"From Consumers to Users\", cyberspace can be divided into three layers—physical infrastructure, logical infrastructure, and content and application layers.^[121]^ Cyber sovereignty involves a State's ability to assert control\n^[118]^ GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n^[119]^ Google Spain SL v.

The scope of cyber sovereignty encompasses not only territorial jurisdiction but also extraterritorial jurisdiction based on the effects principle. States can assert jurisdiction over cyber activities that have direct and substantial effects within their borders, regardless of where the actions originated.\n69. Violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace occur when one State conducts cyber operations or cyber-attacks that undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of another State. Such violations may involve cyber espionage, data breaches, or cyber warfare, targeting a State's critical infrastructure, government systems, or sensitive information.\n70. The legal implications and scope of using sovereignty in cyberspace should be limited. States have sovereignty over information and communications technology infrastructure within their territory, according to the founding concept of sovereignty. An essential consideration is that the use of sovereignty must not infringe on the sovereignty of another State. This means that the use of ICTs must not jeopardize other States' cyberinfrastructure.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 53\nCyber-attacks on its critical infrastructure threaten State sovereignty and may be seen as evidence of intervention in its territorial sovereignty.\n## III.B. State sovereignty violation: applicable law\n71. There is an increasing need for an international legal framework to address these challenges since traditional forms of State sovereignty are no longer adequate to meet the international character of cyberspace. The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States is one of the keyways that international law is applied to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n72. The principle of non-intervention has been applied to address challenges such as cyber espionage and cyber assaults on State-controlled infrastructure. For example, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack has been deemed a violation of US sovereignty, illustrating how State sovereignty can be encroached upon in cyberspace and how international law can be employed to address such infringements. The US government attributed the attack to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), leading to the\n Finland, ibid., 2; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Grounded in the principle of non-intervention, the US government responded by imposing sanctions on the DPRK and taking other measures to hold its government accountable. Hacking identified here as a type of cyber intrusion, was attributed by the US government to the DPRK. The US response, including the imposition of penalties, can be seen as an effort to hold the country accountable for its actions and discourage future cyber intrusions. The actions taken by the US also convey a message to other nations that cross-border intrusions will not be tolerated and will be met with a response.\n73. The principle of jurisdiction is another way in which international law applies to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. The power of a State to exercise control over a certain area or individuals is referred to as jurisdiction. Jurisdiction in cyberspace may be a complicated problem since it is not always apparent where a certain cyber-related action is taking place or who is liable for it.\n74. Several revisions and adaptations may be required for the successful application of international law to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. One possible modification would be to explain the application to cyber activities of existing norms of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention. This modification could include the development of new legal interpretations or more detailed guidance on how these principles should be implemented in the context of cyberspace. Another adaptation would be to create new legal tools or soft instruments that explicitly handle violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. A new legally binding document on State sovereignty in cyberspace could be developed by the relevant UN entities to set out explicit norms and principles for the safeguarding of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n75. International law should address the problem of attribution and responsibility or violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. Attribution,\n Ibid.\n Michael N. Schmitt, above n.74, 173; Michael N.

Creating new legal frameworks or principles to meet this challenge may clarify the duties and responsibility of States for cyber-related activities that breach the sovereignty of others.\n## IV. Extraterritorial effects and international law\n76. Having explored the legal matters and relevant laws concerning violations of State sovereignty, another noteworthy aspect pertains to the impact of cyberspace, where multiple principles may come into play, causing cross-border implications. Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities.\n## IV.A. Extraterritorial effects: the legal issue\n77. The principle of extraterritoriality is addressed in the negative rather than the positive context. Typically, any legal action taken by a State impacts the region under its control. At times, the acts of one State may have an impact on the activities of another or within another territory and beyond its legislative jurisdiction.\n78. The question of jurisdiction is a critical one. One of the interesting types of core principles related to extraterritorial effects is the nationality\nWrongful Acts 2001, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, vol. II (part Two), A/56/49 (Vol. I)/Corr.4.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nprinciple. The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location. It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.\n79. In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities. Cyber operations conducted by individuals or entities who are nationals of a particular State may have effects that extend beyond that State's borders, potentially impacting other States and their interests. This raises questions about the application of international law to such cyber operations and whether they may be considered extraterritorial.\n80. The nationality principle serves as a legal basis for States to assert jurisdiction over cyber activities conducted by their nationals, even if the effects of those activities are felt outside their territory. This principle allows States to exercise their regulatory authority and apply their laws to address the potential harm caused by cyber operations carried out by their citizens abroad. By doing so, the nationality principle helps mitigate the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities and provides a means for States to address cyber threats that originate from their nationals.\n81. In connection with the application of international law to cyberspace, the nationality principle can be relevant in determining which State has jurisdiction over specific cyber incidents and whether a State has the right to\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 57\nrespond to cyber operations that have an impact on its interests. This principle helps establish a link between the State and the conduct of its nationals in cyberspace, enabling the State to assert its rights and responsibilities concerning the activities of its citizens in the digital realm. However, the application of the nationality principle in cyberspace can be complex, particularly when cyber operations involve multiple actors and cross-border effects, leading to debates on the scope and limitations of the jurisdiction in the digital domain.\n82. A State’s jurisdiction is typically established by its territorial boundaries in the physical world. However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace. In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor. Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach, and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law. The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n83. Another facet of international law's extraterritorial effects in cyberspace concerns the issue of State responsibility. States have an obligation under international law to avoid interfering with the rights of other States and to compensate victims for their illegal conduct. Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.\n84. There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^[151]^\n85. The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.\n86. Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^[152]^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.\n87. In conclusion, the extraterritorial impacts of domestic law in cyberspace are increasingly complicated and have grown major implications for jurisdiction, State responsibility, extraterritorial application, and human rights. While legal academics and practitioners continue to argue the optimal\n^[151]^ Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, above n.75, 154-158 and 165-167.\n^[152]^ Mireille Hildebrandt, *Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to Enforce in Cyberspace? Bodin, Schmitt, Grotius in Cyberspace*, 63(2) The University of Toronto LJ (2013), 197.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 59\nsolution to these concerns, it is evident that new techniques are required to ensure that international law can successfully govern the digital domain of cyberspace. Many international and regional legislation, policies, and recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.\n## IV.B. Extraterritorial effects: applicable law\n88. Extraterritorial effects in cyberspace have expanded in recent years, as the internet and other digital technologies have enabled individuals and non-State entities to operate beyond national borders.^[153]^ There is an increasing need for international legal frameworks to handle these challenges, as traditional notions of State sovereignty may no longer be adequate, given the global nature of cyberspace.\n89. There are several examples of international law being used to address extraterritorial effects in cyberspace.\n90. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017 is one example of the use of international law.^[154]^ The attack disrupted hospitals, businesses, and government agencies in over 150 countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers. Many States and cybersecurity experts blamed the hack on the DPRK's government.^[155]^ The UN Security Council (UNSC) has passed several resolutions and issued statements on cyber security and international law, including UNSC Resolution 2341 (2017), which recognizes\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nthe growing use of ICTs and the need for collective action to address the challenges posed by their malicious use. The UNSC has also underscored the need for States to work together to address the extraterritorial implications of cyber operations like the WannaCry attack and to combat cybercrime and the proliferation of malicious cyber tools.\n91. Another example is the Stuxnet worm. As mentioned above, the worm, identified in 2010, was developed to target and disrupt the control systems of industrial facilities, notably nuclear sites in Iran. While the identity of the attacker is not explicitly stated, it is important to note that Iran has its perspective on the origin of the attack. The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities. International law is applicable to this incident, offering a framework for the extraterritorial effects of action in cyberspace. As previously stated, the UN Charter, especially the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality, prohibits States from asserting jurisdiction over another State’s territory without its consent.\n92. The existing international legal system provides a framework for dealing with extraterritoriality in cyberspace, but it is not without constraints. The UN Charter’s principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality offer a basis for doing so, but due to the unique character of cyberspace, such as the difficulties in determining the origin and responsibility of a cyber-related action, applying these principles can be problematic. Uncertainty and the\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 61\nabsence of defined norms and principles for applying international law in cyberspace might make it difficult for States to address extraterritoriality effectively. A State’s reaction to extraterritorial impacts like cyber espionage and cyber-attacks might also be hampered by a lack of agreement on how to interpret and implement international law in cyberspace.\n93. Overcoming these limitations requires that the existing international legal framework for cyberspace be maintained and strengthened. This can be accomplished by negotiating new legally enforceable instruments, such as draft articles on State jurisdiction over cyber activities, or by developing soft law instruments, such as guidelines or recommendations. States should also continue to collaborate to build shared understandings and norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace; this can aid in clarifying the application of international law in this setting.\n## V. Cyberspace sovereignty and international law\n94. This section represents the core legal concern pertaining to the applicability of international law in the realm of cyberspace. It explores the progressive matter of cyberspace sovereignty, a subject that is infrequently examined within a broader framework. Within this section, the notion of cyberspace sovereignty is introduced, along with its associated legal intricacies, while also addressing how international law could potentially be relevant in navigating this novel domain of sovereignty.\n## V.A. Cyberspace sovereignty: the legal issue\n95. Sovereignty is traditionally understood as a territorial concept, entailing a State’s exclusive control over its territory, populace, and domestic affairs. On the other hand, jurisdiction expands beyond territorial borders\n---\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nand encompasses various principles, including the nationality principle, which grants States authority over their citizens regardless of their location. In the digital era, the emergence of cyberspace has introduced new challenges, leading to the notion of cyber sovereignty, where States assert control over the virtual realm.\n96. Sovereignty, rooted in the Westphalian system, is the bedrock of international law, emphasizing a State’s exclusive control within its territorial boundaries. It entails the supreme authority of a State over its domestic affairs, encompassing governance, laws, and enforcement mechanisms. Traditionally, sovereignty was a territorial concept, asserting that a State has the right to govern its territory and protect its national interests.\n97. Yochai Benkler’s Three-Layer Internet Model presents a theoretical framework for understanding the evolving structure of the internet. The model encompasses three distinct layers: the physical infrastructure layer, the logical layer, and the content layer. The physical infrastructure layer involves the tangible hardware and network components that enable data transmission. The logical layer involves the protocols and standards that govern data transmission, while the content layer comprises the information, data, and services accessible to users.\n98. As the internet has become an essential part of modern societies, States have sought to assert control over cyberspace, giving rise to the concept of cyber sovereignty. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State’s desire and efforts to assert control and regulation over the virtual realm, including internet access, content, and data flow within its borders. While cyberspace transcends\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 63\nphysical borders, States increasingly assert control over online activities within their territory, reflecting their quest for digital governance.\n99. The functioning of cyberspace does not rely upon a single ICT infrastructure in one territory; rather, it requires extensive cooperation and interconnection with other ICT infrastructures globally. Cyberspace is a borderless and interconnected domain that operates across multiple jurisdictions, and its seamless functioning depends on the collaboration between different countries and their respective ICT systems. The Internet, as a core component of cyberspace, is a network of networks that spans the globe, and each network’s smooth operation is interdependent on the functioning of others. This interconnection ensures data transfer, communication, and accessibility across borders, facilitating the exchange of information and services on a global scale.\n100. Cooperation among various stakeholders is crucial in maintaining the stability and functionality of cyberspace. Governments, private companies, internet service providers, and technical organisations work together to develop and implement technical standards, policies, and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet and cyberspace. Additionally, international agreements and treaties facilitate cooperation on issues such as cybersecurity, data protection, and intellectual property rights. This collaborative approach fosters an inclusive and interconnected cyberspace, ensuring that it remains a valuable and essential tool for communication, innovation, and economic growth on a global scale.\n(Council on Foreign Relations, 30 October 2019) (https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty); Anqi Wang, Cyber Sovereignty at Its Boldest: A Chinese Perspective, 16(2) The Ohio State Technology Law Journal (2020), 403-417.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n101. In cyberspace, the involvement of non-State actors plays a significant role in shaping its governance and technical aspects. One notable example of a non-State actor in cyberspace governance is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF is a global community of experts, engineers, and researchers who develop and promote voluntary standards and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP). This open and collaborative organization operates independently of any government and allows various stakeholders to contribute to the development and maintenance of internet standards.\n102. The IETF’s role in shaping the technical foundations of cyberspace exemplifies the influence of non-State actors in the functioning of the digital realm. As an inclusive and decentralized organisation, the IETF invites contributions from individuals, academics, private sector entities, and governments, ensuring a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance. While State actors also participate in the IETF’s discussions, its decision-making processes are transparent and open to all, allowing non-State actors to have a meaningful impact on the development and evolution of internet standards. This involvement of non-State actors in shaping cyberspace underscores the dynamic and diverse nature of governance in the digital age.\n103. Beyond the jurisdiction of States, the functioning of the internet is partially controlled by various entities, both governmental and non-governmental, operating in the cyberspace arena. One significant non-governmental entity that exerts influence over internet governance is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is responsible for managing and coordinating the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses. This coordination ensures the stable and secure functioning of the internet, and it is\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 65\nconducted through a multi-stakeholder model involving diverse stakeholders from different countries and sectors.\n104. In addition to ICANN, various private technology corporations, such as major internet service providers and tech giants, hold significant control over the functioning of the internet beyond State jurisdiction. These corporations own and operate vast portions of the internet infrastructure, including data centers, communication networks, and cloud computing services. Their actions and policies can have far-reaching impacts on the accessibility, privacy, and security of cyberspace. Furthermore, some technology companies have been involved in content moderation and censorship decisions, which can influence the free flow of information on the internet. The multi-faceted involvement of both non-governmental organizations like ICANN and private corporations in shaping the functioning of the internet highlights the complex and evolving landscape of cyberspace sovereignty.\n105. Activities in cyberspace might have an impact on sovereignty and have extraterritorial effects. However, some propose separating cyberspace from domestic law, as Chinese President Xi Jinping did when emphasizing the idea of cyber sovereignty. In general discussions of jurisdiction, the\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\nterritory is defined as the area in which States can exercise their sovereignty. A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n106. Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).\nCyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.\n107. The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.\n108. Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace. There are a few international agreements and conventions dealing with\nCreemers, China’s Conception of Cyber Sovereignty: Rhetoric and Realization, in: Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg, Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (2020), 107-144; Binxing Fang, above n.73, v.\n Binxing Fang, above n.73, 78.\n Ibid., 84.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 67\ninternet issues, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and the UN Cybercrime treaty, but a clear consensus on how these agreements should be universally applied to the unique dynamics of cyberspace is lacking.\n109. It is possible to argue that ICT threats may have consequences ranging from State sovereignty to cyberspace sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty in international law is significant because sovereignty in relation to territories, populations, and regimes inside its territory is relevant to cyberspace.\n110. In the context of cyber operations, the Three-Layer Internet Model aids in understanding the implications of different activities on State sovereignty. Low-level cyber operations, such as passive information gathering, may not necessarily violate sovereignty, as they do not involve significant intrusion or disruption. However, high-level cyber operations, like cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure or disinformation campaigns, can directly challenge a State's sovereignty by jeopardizing its ability to govern and protect its population.\n111. The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations. Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain. For instance, China's Great Firewall exemplifies a cyber sovereignty approach, where the State enforces strict controls over internet access and content to maintain political stability.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n112. The concepts of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and cyber sovereignty represent distinct layers of authority in the digital age. Sovereignty remains anchored in territorial control, jurisdiction extends beyond borders, and cyber sovereignty emerges as States grapple with regulating the virtual realm. Understanding the implications of different cyber operations on State sovereignty is crucial for crafting effective cyber policies and fostering international cooperation in the digital era. By incorporating the Three-Layer Internet Model, policymakers can navigate the complexities of cyberspace and strike a balance between safeguarding sovereignty and fostering an open and secure global Internet environment.\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n113. International law applies to cyberspace sovereignty in several ways, primarily. One of the primary means is through the principle of State sovereignty, which affirms the ability of States to govern and control their territory. This argument is used to explain States' regulation and control of the internet within their borders, which includes the capacity to restrict or prohibit certain websites, manage online material, and respond to cyber threats emanating from within their borders.\n114. Another way international law applies to internet sovereignty is through the principle of non-intervention in other States' internal affairs. This principle is employed to defend governments' capacity to respond to cyber threats that originate beyond their borders, such as through defensive cyber operations or the imposition of penalties against foreign entities.\n115. International treaties and agreements also allow the application of international law to cyberspace sovereignty. The ICCPR, for example,\nterpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways); Jessica Baron, Cyber-Sovereignty and China's Great Firewall: An Interview With James Griffiths (Forbes, 8 April 2019) (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2019/04/08/cyber-sovereignty-and-chinas-great-firewall-an-interview-with-james-griffiths/?sh=2c0c9a43747b).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 69\nrecognizes the right to free expression and the prohibition of arbitrary intervention with privacy, both of which are relevant in cyberspace.\n116. The ICCPR, one of the most important international instruments for protecting human rights online, has direct relevance to the issue of cyberspace sovereignty. Article 19 of the ICCPR preserves the right to free speech and prohibits arbitrary privacy infringements. These rights are directly relevant to cyberspace since they safeguard people’s capacity to access and distribute information online without intervention from authorities. The ICCPR also acknowledges the right to peaceful assembly, which applies to online gatherings such as demonstrations and social media campaigns. Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful intervention with privacy, which is directly relevant to cyberspace. The right to privacy includes the right to have personal data protected and is especially important in the internet environment, where massive amounts of personal data are gathered, kept, and shared.\n117. International treaties like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) establish frameworks for dealing with cybercrime. The BCC is an important international mechanism for the application of\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\ninternational law to the topic of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs. This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n118. The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime. Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders. The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software. This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence, allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.\n119. Despite the existence of the BCC, the absence of direct legislation for cyberspace creates challenges. The international legal system, guided by principles such as State sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States, lacks a well-defined framework to handle the complexities of cyberspace. While the UN Charter and other international agreements, which touch upon issues of sovereignty and self-defense, can be invoked to legitimize State actions safeguarding national security interests in cyberspace, they\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71\ndo not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.\n120. Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply.\n## VI. Conclusion\n121. In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.\n122. The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.\n123. The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain. The Tallinn Manual, a legal guide on the\nChinese JIL (2024)\napplication of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.\n124. Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.\n125. While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked.\n Michael N.

In the realm of modern digital interactions, envision yourself sitting at your computer, immersed in your daily routine when an email notification grabs your attention. The sender appears to be your trusted bank, urgently notifying you of an account issue and providing a link to rectify the situation. Intrigued and slightly concerned, you click on the link, inadvertently divulging your sensitive information on what turns out to be a fraudulent website. Unbeknownst to you, you have fallen victim to a shrewd cybercriminal tactic known as email phishing.\n2. This scenario of email phishing serves as a tangible example, one that resonates with countless individuals, of the pervasive nature of information and communication technology (ICT) threats. These threats transcend geographical confines, breaching the virtual boundaries we might perceive as secure. In a world where criminal actors can operate from different corners of the globe, targeting unsuspecting victims, the conventional notion of sovereignty finds itself challenged. The intangible nature of ICT threats means they can originate within one country, traverse servers scattered across multiple jurisdictions, and inflict damage on victims situated far away. Thus, combating these modern perils necessitates a collaborative, global strategy that supersedes conventional territorial limits—a manifestation of how sovereignty has evolved in the digital age.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 27\n3. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a surge in ICT utilization for remote operations, has accentuated the pivotal role of these technologies. While ICT empowers States, businesses, and individuals, its rapid advancement has also brought forth intricacies and concerns that ripple far beyond national frontiers. The interconnectedness facilitated by these technologies underscores the importance of grappling with the evolving concept of sovereignty, as we navigate an increasingly borderless digital landscape.\n4. “ICT threats” are malicious uses of ICTs perpetrated by both State and non-State actors with a significant impact on a variety of factors.¹ ICT threats can be divided into three categories. First, ICT threats are a form of cybercrime that jeopardizes international security and stability. This activity affects societal and economic growth, as well as military security of States.² It also has the potential to disrupt critical information infrastructure; for example, infrastructure associated with essential public services, such as the internet or the public health system,³ might be attacked or vulnerabilities in the system exploited.⁴ The second category includes the malicious use by States of ICT-enabled covert information campaigns to impact another State’s processes, systems, and total stability. This might put international peace and security at risk, as well as inflict direct or indirect harm to individuals.⁵ The use of ICTs for terrorist goals, the third category, includes terrorist acts against ICTs or ICT-dependent infrastructure perpetrated by harmful non-State actors, in addition to their activities related to recruitment, financing, training and incitement of terrorism. This issue has the potential to threaten international safety and security.⁶\n5. Despite these issues, there is currently no special international legislation dealing with ICT risks, notably State-sponsored cyber threats. Thus far, the only efforts to address such government operations have involved the application of existing international law, including the prohibition on the use of\n1.

In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security.¹⁰ The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace.¹¹ Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace.¹² Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n6. Some regional laws address cyber-related issues. For example, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (BCC) initiated by the Council of Europe, regulates collaboration among parties in the protection of the community against cybercrime, by harmonizing domestic law, improving investigative procedures, and boosting cooperation among member States.¹³ The African Union Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection has not yet come into force. It aims to establish a credible framework for cybersecurity in Africa by organizing electronic transactions, protecting personal data, promoting cybersecurity, e-governance and combating cybercrime.¹⁴\n7 UN Charter, art. 2(4).\n8 UN HRC, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (16 July 2012), UN Doc.

In a narrower context, several international organizations have also come forward to acknowledge the current state of international law as applied to cyberspace. For example, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolution 73/266 supports the use of ICT for peaceful purposes, calls for the prevention of the conflict caused by ICT usage, and the provision of education on advancements in the field of ICTs in the context of international security.¹⁵ The European Union (EU) has examined and exchanged views on worldwide cyber security challenges; such efforts have expedited collaboration among EU member States, including diplomatic collaboration and the development of cyber diplomacy skills and an EU Cybersecurity Strategy.¹⁶ The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also adopted a crucial strategy document on 28 January 2021, the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025), which is intended to protect against cyberspace threats and assist the digital economy and community.¹⁷ This is only a strategy document and is not legally enforceable.\n8. This research article has two primary goals. The first goal is to identify the nature of international law in cyberspace and how it impacts State sovereignty, leading to cross-border consequences. The second goal is to examine how the application of international law to cyberspace has contributed to the growth of cyberspace sovereignty. It seeks to address three key questions: First, do non-physical ICT threats violate the sovereignty of other States? If so, to what extent does current international law apply to such threats? Second, can domestic cyberspace laws have cross-border effects, and to what\nPure Sovereignty in Cyberspace, 5 February 2024 (https://opiniojuris.org/2024/02/05/the-african-union-rightly-endorses-pure-sovereignty-in-cyberspace/).\n15 UN General Assembly, Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 22 December 2018: Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (2 January 2019), UN Doc.

And third, does the principle of cyberspace sovereignty exist, and how does it compare to the principle of territorial sovereignty?\n9. This research article is structured into four primary sections. The initial section offers an overview of ICT threats and their interplay with international law, examining the existence of such threats, and their legal implications for States, and providing insights into international law within the cyberspace context. It examines principles such as State sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition of the use of force within the cyberspace context. Subsequently, the following section highlights a critical concern—State sovereignty violation. It elucidates the key legal issues and relevant applicable laws. Moreover, the subsequent part delves into the intricate matter of extraterritorial effects in cyberspace, exploring the associated legal complexities and applicable legal frameworks. Lastly, the concluding section investigates the emerging realm of cyberspace sovereignty and its interaction with international law. By analyzing these multifaceted dimensions, this research aims to enhance comprehension of the evolving legal landscape within cyberspace and underscore the necessity for comprehensive international regulations.\n## II. Overview of ICT threats in international law\n10. This section presents an overview of the threats posed by ICT from the perspective of international law. The existence of ICT risks is becoming increasingly threatening. This section is divided into two subsections: (1) the existence of ICT risks and the legal effects on States and (2) international law in cyberspace. The first briefly highlights the nature of ICT threats and the risk they pose to international security and stability, economic and social growth, security, and individual well-being. The other subsection presents an overview of existing international law relevant to cyberspace as a foundation for how current international law might be applied to challenges posed by ICT threats.\n## II.A. Existence of ICT threats and legal effects on States\n11. The challenges of addressing ICT threats are not new and have received considerable attention. The GGE on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security was established in 2011 to assess actual and prospective dangers, and to address issues of ICT use impacting the international community and the\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 31\nrisks that it may be used in a manner inconsistent with the preservation of international stability and security.¹⁸ This would gravely jeopardize the integrity of the State and individual infrastructure. Following that, additional meetings were conducted to address the existence of ICT dangers,¹⁹ which may be described as follows.\n12. The malicious use of ICT presents a complex and evolving challenge, encompassing cyberattacks, data breaches and other cyber threats that transcend borders and undermine State sovereignty.²⁰ Beyond immediate material harm, these activities have far-reaching societal, economic, and geopolitical consequences, necessitating a comprehensive response that combines technical solutions, legal frameworks, and international cooperation.²¹ Addressing malicious ICT use requires ongoing innovation and collaboration to ensure a secure digital environment for individuals, businesses, and governments.\n13. ICT threats, broadly defined as the intentional and malicious use of information technology, which can be orchestrated by State or non-State actors. The characterization of activities as ICT threats may vary geographically, yet their consequences have global implications.²² However, the classification of activities as ICT threats necessitates adherence to specific criteria.\n18 UNGA Res 66/24 (2 December 2011) Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security, UN Doc.

Characteristics of malicious ICT usage may appear in many circumstances, for example, ICT is used aggressively to achieve military goals.²⁵ This form of ICT activity has the potential to be utilized as a tool or weapon in future wars between States.\n15. Second, such acts may be used to wage abusive information campaigns²⁶ to impact the processes, systems, and general stability of other States and may directly or indirectly impact individuals.\n16. Third, ICT activities can cause harm to essential infrastructure supporting services at the national, regional, or international levels.²⁷ The critical information infrastructure targeted and subject to critical assaults includes essential public services, especially critical technological infrastructure on the internet, and businesses in the health sector. Information concerning a person's health is highly sensitive and vulnerable, as has become apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.²⁸\n17. Fourth, ICT might be employed for terrorist reasons.²⁹ Such actions might involve the direct use of ICT for terrorism or troop allocation. The use of ICT to provide financial assistance, training, and promotion and the act of assaulting ICT infrastructure are all examples of unlawful ICT usage.\n18. Misuse of ICT can be classified according to the technique, procedure, and method employed; for example, cyber-attack, cyber espionage, cybercrime, or cyberterrorism all constitute forms of misuse. However, this article does not go into detail regarding each category and only a brief overview of these ICT threats is provided.\n19. In the realm of modern warfare and national security, the terminologies of cyber operations and cyber-attacks have gained prominence in military\n23 Ibid., para.8.\n24 Ibid., para.9.\n25 GGE 2015 Report, above n.19, para.4.\n26 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.9.\n27 Ibid., para.10.\n28 Ibid.\n29 Ibid., para.13.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 33\nmanuals of various States,³⁰ including the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). However, these concepts are not unique to the UK and the US; other nations also define and address them in their military doctrines. For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare.³¹ Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.³²\n20. In the UK military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the planning and synchronization of activities in and through cyberspace to enable freedom of maneuver and to achieve military objectives.”³³ On the other hand, cyber-attacks are considered a subset of cyber operations and are described as “leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defense’s logistic capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life. As such, a cyberattack could have comparable effects to a physical attack.”³⁴ Similarly, in the US military manual, cyber operations are defined as “the employment of cyberspace capabilities where the primary purpose is to achieve objectives in or through cyberspace”,³⁵ whereas cyber-attacks represent “actions taken in cyberspace that create noticeable denial effects (i.e., degradation, disruption, or destruction) in cyberspace or\n30 Oona A.

The distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks is of utmost significance, as it delineates the varying intents and implications associated with these concepts. In the US military manual, cyber-attacks are regarded as akin to the use of force, thereby connecting them to the principle of self-defense under international law.37 This perspective suggests that cyber-attacks can potentially cause significant harm, prompting responses within the framework of traditional armed conflicts.38 However, it is important to note that this viewpoint is specific to the US, and not all States universally agree with this classification. Conversely, cyber operations encompass a broader spectrum of activities in cyberspace, covering not only offensive and defensive actions but also non-kinetic operations.39 These may include intelligence gathering, disruption of enemy communications, or the safeguarding of critical infrastructure. The broader definition of cyber operations underscores that not all activities in cyberspace are tantamount to cyber-attacks.\n22. Given the unique attributes of cyberspace, the distinction between cyber operations and cyber-attacks becomes even more complex. The fluidity and virtual nature of cyberspace blur traditional boundaries, making it challenging to pinpoint the location or source of certain actions.40 This ambiguity can be exploited by malicious actors, including State and non-State entities, to perpetrate cyber-attacks while concealing their identity and intent.41 The difficulty in attribution poses a significant challenge in terms of international legal frameworks and responses to cyber incidents.\n23. The proliferation of cyber threats necessitates the development of comprehensive strategies to address the nuances of cyber operations and\n36 Ibid.\n37 Ibid., 2-15; James E McGhee, Cyber Redux: The Schmitt Analysis, Tallinn Manual and US Cyber Policy, 2(1) Journal of Law &amp; Cyber Warfare (2013), 64-70; Miranda Grange, Cyber Warfare and the Law of Armed Conflict (2014), 9-10.\n38 Neil S.

States are increasingly recognizing the importance of bolstering their cyber capabilities and establishing robust cyber defense mechanisms.⁴² Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on international cooperation and information-sharing to counter cyber threats collectively. However, divergent national perspectives and varying thresholds for response have led to debates about how to effectively regulate and govern cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n24. Various forms of cyber operations represent distinct levels of intrusion into computer networks and systems, making them essential factors in evaluating violations of State sovereignty. Among these cyber operations, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and malware are prominent examples. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a flood of traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. Such attacks do not necessarily breach the target’s network but can disrupt critical services and impact a nation’s ability to function effectively in cyberspace.⁴³ For example, the deployment of DDoS attacks against Estonia in 2007 had a tremendous impact on the country’s internet infrastructure.⁴⁴\n25. A cyber-attack is commonly defined as any activity aimed at degrading the functionality of a computer network for a political or national security objective.⁴⁵ This is evident in incidents that is previously mentioned when the Estonia fell victim to DDoS attacks, highlighting how cyber-attacks can intertwine political goal.⁴⁶ While the primary focus is on activities with political or national security objectives, it is important to acknowledge that cyber\n⁴² William Banks, Cyber Attribution and State Responsibility, 97 International Law Studies (2021), 1065; European Commission, Cyber: towards stronger EU capabilities for effective operational cooperation, solidarity and resilience, Press Release, 18 April 2023 (https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_2243); Matt Kucik, How State and Local Governments Can Bolster their Cyber Defenses, Tenable, 24 May 2022 (https://pt-br.tenable.com/blog/how-state-and-local-governments-can-bolster-their-cyber-defenses).\n⁴³ U.

The term “cyber operations” could serve as a more encompassing umbrella, covering a range of activities in cyberspace, from intelligence gathering to disruptive operations. The absence of a uniform cluster-definition in international law to differentiate between these activities highlights a challenge, and the regulation of such activities may require a detailed and careful approach, accounting for the diversity of cyber operations.\n26. Malware, on the other hand, refers to malicious software designed to infiltrate and compromise computer systems.⁴⁷ It can range from ransomware, which encrypts valuable data until a ransom is paid, to advanced persistent threats (APTs) capable of clandestinely maintaining long-term access to targeted systems.⁴⁸ These forms of cyber operations pose significant challenges to the affected States, as they can lead to data breaches, economic losses, and even the manipulation of critical infrastructure.\n27. Recent cyber incidents have demonstrated the varying degrees of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. The 2020 SolarWinds attack, a sophisticated supply-chain compromise, involved the insertion of a backdoor into the software update of SolarWinds, a widely used IT management tool. The attackers targeted various government and private organizations, including sensitive government agencies, marking a high level of intrusion into critical systems.⁴⁹\n⁴⁷ What is malware?: Malware or malicious software definition, Malwarebytes (https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware); What is malware?, CISCO (https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/products/security/what-is-malware.html).\n⁴⁸ What is an APT, Imperva (https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/apt-advanced-persistent-threat/); Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Attacks’, Cynet (https://www.cynet.com/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-attacks/).\n⁴⁹ Saheed Oladimeji and Sean Michael Kerner, SolarWinds hack explained: Everything you need to know, TechTarget, 2023 (https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/SolarWinds-hack-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know); Isabella Jibilian and Katie Canales, The US is readying sanctions against Russia over the SolarWinds cyber attack.

Similarly, the interference in the 2016 US presidential election revealed the potential for cyber operations to influence political processes.⁵⁰ State-sponsored actors leveraged phishing attacks to gain access to political organizations' networks, stole sensitive data, and conducted disinformation campaigns.⁵¹ This intrusion highlighted the impact of cyber operations on a nation's democratic processes and raised concerns about safeguarding sovereignty and electoral integrity.⁵²\n29. These examples underscore the significance of understanding the varying levels of intrusion that different cyber operations can achieve. Assessing the violation of State sovereignty in cyberspace necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the techniques, tools, and intentions behind cyber operations. Moreover, international cooperation and robust cybersecurity measures are imperative to safeguard States from cyber threats that have the potential to disrupt vital functions, compromise national security, and infringe upon sovereignty.\n30. Cyber espionage may take several forms. It can be physical, for example, where code is placed into hardware to restrict access from a stream, or it might rely on cable channels. It might leverage the spread of malware to control communication flows or take a more sophisticated form, such as phishing, to acquire access and modify data.⁵³\n31.

They can constitute fraud, unlawful copyright, or trademark activity, hate speech, or the transmission of illegal or infringing personal information directed at persons or financial information.⁵⁵\n32. Finally, cyberterrorism refers to the utilization of computer network technologies with the intent to disrupt critical national infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and government operations, or to coerce and instill fear in a government or civilian population.⁵⁶ The spectrum of cyberterrorism activities encompasses propaganda, financial manipulation, training, planning, or execution of cyber-attacks.⁵⁷\n## II.B. Overview of international law in cyberspace\n33. Misuse of ICT necessarily has consequences for the State, particularly in legal terms. The first and most important legal impact concerns State sovereignty.⁵⁸ The action constituting an ICT threat differs in nature from conventional actions or omissions such as the use of the military to violate the territorial integrity of other States by deploying weapons, or interfering with or influencing politics.

It might take the shape of internet acts involving acts outside the State.\n34. Despite the absence of physical intrusion, cyber-attacks can influence the State,⁵⁹ raising questions about their classification under traditional international law concepts like Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. Assessing the effectiveness of a weapon, including cyber-attacks, may involve considering the harm caused.⁶⁰ Furthermore, ICT misuse could amount to intervention in the internal affairs of other States,⁶¹ invoking the principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, which are foundational in international law.\n35. The complexities surrounding the integration of international law into cyberspace constitute a dynamic challenge that has recently attracted the interest of scholars, policymakers, and practitioners.⁶² One of the most challenging aspects of applying international law to cyberspace is that it is a virtual rather than a physical domain.⁶³ The anonymity and transnational character of cyberspace operations make it difficult to place responsibility for cyber incidents on individual participants.\n⁵⁹ Nicholas Tsagourias, The Legal Status of Cyberspace: Sovereignty Redux?, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 22-23.\n⁶⁰ Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 11; Corfu Channel, Separate Opinion of Judge Alvarez, ICJ Reports 1949, 43; Resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970 containing the Declaration of Principles of International Law, Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, UN Doc.

Despite these challenges, experts and practitioners are increasingly in agreement that existing international law applies to cyberspace. According to the Human Rights Council and GGE, “the same rights that States have offline must also be protected online” and that “international law, and in particular, the Charter of the UN, is applicable and is essential for ensuring peace and security in the online environment.”\n37. This viewpoint is supported by the fact that the core concepts of international law, such as State sovereignty and the principle of non-intervention, apply equally to the cyber domain. Therefore, this section discusses three key principles of international law: the principle of State sovereignty, the principle of non-intervention, and the principle of prohibition of the use of force.\n## II.B.i. Principle of State sovereignty\n38. Sovereignty, a core tenet of international law, entails the recognition and respect of States for each other’s autonomy. It finds expression in the jurisdiction principle, governing a State’s legal authority to impact entities under its control. While sovereignty is bound by a State’s borders, exceptions arise, such as nationality, where power extends beyond territory. This principle, essential to international law, embodies a State’s paramount authority over territory, governance, and populace. It underscores Statehood, denoting independence in domestic and global matters. Jurisdiction, integral to sovereignty, extends beyond territorial confines. It grants a State the legal power to enforce laws both domestically and, in specific cases, abroad. Unlike sovereignty, jurisdiction’s reach is not confined to borders. In the realm of cyberspace, where physical limits dissolve, jurisdiction’s extraterritorial application is pivotal. Thus, differentiating sovereignty and jurisdiction holds key\n64 UN General Assembly, above n.8, 2; UN HRC, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet (Human Rights Council, 14 July 2014), UN Doc.

There are two approaches to the question of sovereignty in cyberspace: respecting State sovereignty in cyberspace and expanding sovereignty to include cyberspace. First, the approach of the GGE is that the principle of State sovereignty applies to State action in ICT-related activities and includes the right to control ICT infrastructure within its territory.71 The international legal duties associated with sovereignty are thus extensive and applicable to State ICT activity. States may exercise jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure on their territory by enacting policies and legislation and developing procedures to safeguard that infrastructure from ICT-related risks.72 The emerging ICT threat may contribute to the development of the notion of cyberspace sovereignty. Sovereign equality is the primary principle in the UN Charter.73 The territorial jurisdiction of a State is its authority to undertake numerous activities inside its territory, including the execution of ICT-related activities. States should, therefore, also have control over cyberspace.\n40. The application of international law to cyberspace has not gone undisputed. One important issue is determining how the principle of State sovereignty should be applied in the cyber domain. Sovereignty in cyberspace should be construed as control.74 This suggests that governments have the right to exert control over their cyber territory and activities, but this authority does not extend to the cyber activities of other States. The principle of State sovereignty, which is fundamental in international law, finds application in cyberspace in various means.\n71 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n72 Ibid.; Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, Application of International Law to Cyberspace: Summary of Israel's Approach (25 October 2021) (https://embassies.gov.il/UnGeneva/prioritiesstatements/ScienceTechnologyDevelopment/Pages/Israel-approach-on-the-Application-of-International-Law-to-Cyberspace.aspx).\n73 Binxing Fang, Cyberspace Sovereignty: Reflections on Building a Community of Common Future in Cyberspace (2018), 78; UN Charter, art. 2, para.1; The German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, On the Application of International Law in Cyberspace (2021), 2-3; Michael N.

First, according to the principle, States have the legitimate right to control their territory and activities, encompassing those in cyberspace.75 This entails the right to defend their cyber infrastructure and networks from unauthorized access or assault, taking necessary steps to ensure the security and integrity of their cyber systems. The unique nature of cyberspace as a discrete area is acknowledged, where an attack on State computer facilities can have repercussions on targets situated on land, sea, airspace, or outer space. This complexity prompts a careful consideration of the distinctive meaning of sovereignty in cyberspace within the framework of international law.\n42. Second, State sovereignty implies that States have a responsibility to prevent transborder cyber incidents that originate within their territory and harm other States.76 This means that States have a duty to prevent the launch from their territory of malicious cyber activities including hacking, malware, and DDoS assaults77 and to cooperate with other States to investigate and prosecute cybercrime.78\n43. Finally, the principle gives States the power to regulate their cyberspace activities, including freedom of expression, personal data protection, and critical infrastructure protection.79 This means that States have the authority to enact rules and regulations to control internet use inside their territory and to take steps to defend their citizens' rights and interests online.\n44. To summarize, the principle of State sovereignty can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing States' rights to exercise control over their cyber territory and activities, to prevent transborder cyber incidents, to regulate their cyberspace activities, and to defend against cyber-attacks, if the principles of international law are supported.\n75 Michael N.

The long-standing principle of non-intervention is an essential concept that, like State sovereignty, is part of international customary law.⁸⁰ It upholds the prohibition of intervention, asserting the autonomy of States to make choices and conduct activities within their borders. Economic, social, or political pressure, including economic sanctions, does not amount to intervention.⁸¹ It is important to consider additional arguments that underpin this notion. One such argument is rooted in the recognition of the diverse means through which States engage diplomatically, allowing for a spectrum of actions that fall within the purview of foreign policy implementation rather than intervention.\n46. Distinguishing between economic, social, or political pressure and coercion lies in the degree of force or manipulation exerted to achieve a particular outcome. Economic pressure involves using economic incentives or disincentives to influence a State’s behavior, such as trade sanctions or financial incentives.⁸² Social pressure relies on diplomatic efforts, public opinion, or cultural ties to sway a State’s actions.⁸³ Political pressure, on the other hand, employs diplomatic negotiations, alliances, or international norms to encourage compliance.⁸⁴\n47. Coercion, however, extends beyond mere pressure by involving threats or forceful actions that limit a State’s choices and significantly reduce its\n80 Malcolm N.

Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. $^{86}$ Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. $^{87}$\n48. Intervention in cyberspace is another main priority of the GGE; the State should not interfere in the domestic affairs of other States. $^{88}$ According to the GGE report, States shall not intervene directly or indirectly in the internal affairs of another State, including using ICTs, in conformity with the principle of non-intervention. $^{89}$ The following considerations shape the use of the term \"coercion\" in non-intervention principles, and the term can be interpreted to describe a wide range of cyberspace activities.\n49. Furthermore, States must respect the sovereignty of other States by refraining from cyber activities that might violate another State's territorial\n85 William Michael Reisman, Criteria for the Lawful Use of Force in International Law, 10 Yale JIL (1985), 279-285; Tom J.

In summary, the principle of non-intervention can be applied to cyberspace by recognizing State sovereignty over cyber territory and activities and by establishing that States should not engage in cyber operations that would constitute an intervention in the internal affairs of other States or a violation of other States’ territorial integrity of other States.\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n51. The non-use of force principle, as stated implicitly in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, requires States to refrain from using force or violence, including war.⁹¹ It is unclear whether the use of force must be a physical armed force and whether there must be a kind of physical infringement on the sovereignty of another State. Because the illicit use of ICTs is frequent, there may be a recognition of non-physical force; this will be investigated below using case examples. While the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against a State’s territorial integrity or political independence or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,⁹² it is unclear how this prohibition applies to cyber operations.\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that,\nin their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.⁹³\nThus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain⁹⁴ as they inherently cause harm in two distinct\n90 Marco Roscini, Cyber Operations as a Use of Force, in: Nicholas Tsagourias and Russell Buchan (eds.), Research Handbook on International Law and Cyberspace (2021), 297, 538.\n91 UN Charter, art. 2(4).\n92 Ibid.\n93 GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(d).\n94 Mission of Israel to the UN in Geneva, above n.72; the German Federal Foreign Office and the German Federal Ministry of Defense, above n.73, 6; Foreign,\nChinese JIL (2024)\nways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties.⁹⁵ It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n52. Some scholars believe that the prohibition on the use of force should apply equally to cyberspace and other domains.⁹⁶ For example, in 2010, Iran’s nuclear programme was targeted using the sophisticated Stuxnet virus⁹⁷ to precisely target and impair the operation of the facility’s industrial control systems (ICS).⁹⁸ The malware was spread through USB devices and eventually infected the ICS systems, leading them to fail and ultimately destroying nuclear enrichment centrifuges.⁹⁹ The incident raises serious legal and ethical problems concerning the use of cyber operations in statecraft, the application of international law, and the meaning of the “use of force” in cyberspace. It also emphasizes the importance of States developing norms and legislation for responsible State behavior in that realm.\nCommonwealth &amp; Development Office, Application of international law to states’ conduct in cyberspace: UK statement (UK: Policy Paper, 3 June 2021) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement); HM Government, National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021 (2016) (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf).\n⁹⁵ Michael N.

Other scholars argue that the unique characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to apply the use of force principle in the same manner as in other domains. Rather, they claim that cyber operations that do not result in physical harm or loss of life are a type of coercion that falls short of force. A cyber-attack that disrupts a country's economy, for example, or a cyber-attack aimed at swaying an election, might be regarded as coercion but not a prohibited use of force.¹⁰⁰ Some academics have claimed that the use of force principle does not apply to cyber operations in any way since they do not entail the physical deployment of military personnel and therefore do not fit within the traditional definition of the use of force.¹⁰¹\n54. The use of ICT in the cyber domain, as stated in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, arises from the fact that certain cyber activities can cause damage¹⁰² in two distinct ways.\n55. Firstly, traditional exercises of physical force typically involve the direct application of kinetic energy, resulting in visible and tangible destruction.¹⁰³ However, cyber operations can also cause significant harm and destruction through non-kinetic means, such as disrupting critical infrastructure, compromising sensitive data, and disabling essential services.¹⁰⁴ In the cyber domain, the use of force is not limited to physical impact but can manifest in various ways that may lead to severe consequences. For instance, cyberattacks targeting vital systems like power grids, financial institutions, or communication networks can disrupt the functioning of an entire nation, resulting in significant casualties and economic losses.¹⁰⁵\n100 Marco Roscini, above n.90, 299-301; Oliver Dörr, Use of Force, Prohibition of, in: Rüdiger Wolfrum (ed.), Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (2012), vol.

Second, cyber activities may have cascading effects, leading to a domino effect of disruptions and harm that extends far beyond the initial target.¹⁰⁶ For instance, a cyber operation aimed at disabling a country's military communication network could inadvertently impact civilian communication systems, compromising public safety and welfare.¹⁰⁷ The interconnected nature of digital infrastructure amplifies the potential damage and casualties resulting from cyber operations.¹⁰⁸\n57. The nature of cyber activities, with their ability to inflict harm through both kinetic and non-kinetic means, raises significant concerns regarding their potential to be considered a use of force in the cyber domain. As cyberspace continues to evolve and play an increasingly crucial role in international affairs, clarifying the boundaries of acceptable behavior and defining the thresholds for the use of force in the cyber domain remains a pressing challenge for the international community.\n58. A new interpretation of the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force may be needed to account for the features of cyberspace and guarantee the principle's application to this domain.¹⁰⁹ As previously stated, the anonymity of actors and the lack of physical damage in cyberspace make applying the conventional understanding of the use of force difficult. Furthermore, because there is no clear international consensus on how to define the use of force in the cyber domain, States may have differing views of what constitutes a use of force in the cyber domain. A new interpretation of the use of force\nindustry compare when it comes to the financial loss exposure of cyber threats?

Alternatively, new international rules specific to cyberspace may be required to solve the issues particular to that domain. For example, the Tallinn Manuals,¹¹⁰ which define new norms and principles of State behavior in cyberspace, might offer clarity on how existing international law relates to online environments. New international treaties or conventions addressing the use of force in cyberspace could offer a more complete and explicit framework to guide State behavior in this domain.\n60. To conclude, while the application of international law to cyberspace is a complicated and dynamic matter, there is growing consensus that existing law is relevant. There is no direct international law specifying the regulation and control of cyberspace, especially in the context of violations of traditional concepts of international law, such as cyber-attacks, cybercrime, and other related cyber activities. However, the unique characteristics of cyberspace, such as its virtual nature and the anonymity of actors, present substantial obstacles to the application of traditional concepts of jurisdiction and sovereignty. Furthermore, the ongoing debate over the use of force in cyberspace highlights the need for additional clarity and legal frameworks to control State behavior in this sphere.\n61. Other international law not addressed in this article includes the principle of State responsibility,¹¹¹ international human rights¹¹² and humanitarian law.¹¹³ For the sake of being concise, this section does not address these in any depth.\n## III. State sovereignty violation and international law\n62. The legal complexities in the cyberspace domain can be examined through diverse lenses, shaped by the application of laws to actions occurring within this digital realm. This section delves into pivotal issues encompassing the modern enforcement of international law in the cyberspace arena, commencing with the breach of State sovereignty and the pertinent questions\n110 Michael N.

State sovereignty violation: the legal issue\n63. While jurisdiction is a vital component of sovereignty, it is not always territorially bound.¹¹⁴ In the context of cyberspace, where borders become blurred and the virtual world extends beyond physical boundaries, a clear distinction between these two principles becomes crucial. This discussion aims to analyze the difference between jurisdiction and sovereignty, emphasizing their distinct scopes and implications, particularly in the context of cyber sovereignty and potential violations of State sovereignty.\n64. Sovereignty is a fundamental concept in international law that requires States to employ and restrict the extent of their activities within their sovereign territory while not infringing on the sovereignty of other States.¹¹⁵ The notion of “territory” is legal and political and applies to geographical or physical areas.¹¹⁶ The scope of any State’s sovereignty in respect of its territory may be enlarged to cover regions that, while not geographical or physical, have a legal component.¹¹⁷\n114 Joseph H.

Given the present international rules applicable to cyberspace, the unlawful use of ICT can infringe on other States' sovereignty. One significant issue for international law's applicability to cyberspace is whether it can be enforced within a State's territory.\n66. The GGE study recognized that international law is applicable, maintaining that the UN Charter and the principle of State sovereignty can be applied in cyberspace. The Group reaffirms that\nState sovereignty and international norms and principles that flow from sovereignty apply to the conduct by states of ICT-related activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure within their territory. Existing obligations under international law are applicable to states' ICT-related activity.^^\nThis demonstrates that ICT-related acts, even when not undertaken on another State's territory, can infringe on another State's sovereignty. States may exercise sovereignty by exerting their authority in cyber structures located in their territory over persons, including citizens of other States, residing in their sovereign area.^^\n67. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State's capacity to govern activities within its cyberspace borders, including the regulation and control of information flow, data privacy, and cybersecurity.^^ As Yochai Benkler notes in the article \"From Consumers to Users\", cyberspace can be divided into three layers—physical infrastructure, logical infrastructure, and content and application layers.^^ Cyber sovereignty involves a State's ability to assert control\n^^ GGE 2021 Report, above n.1, para.71(b).\n^^ Google Spain SL v.

The scope of cyber sovereignty encompasses not only territorial jurisdiction but also extraterritorial jurisdiction based on the effects principle.¹²³ States can assert jurisdiction over cyber activities that have direct and substantial effects within their borders, regardless of where the actions originated.¹²⁴\n69. Violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace occur when one State conducts cyber operations or cyber-attacks that undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of another State.¹²⁵ Such violations may involve cyber espionage, data breaches, or cyber warfare, targeting a State's critical infrastructure, government systems, or sensitive information.¹²⁶\n70. The legal implications and scope of using sovereignty in cyberspace should be limited. States have sovereignty over information and communications technology infrastructure within their territory, according to the founding concept of sovereignty.¹²⁷ An essential consideration is that the use of sovereignty must not infringe on the sovereignty of another State. This means that the use of ICTs must not jeopardize other States' cyberinfrastructure.¹²⁸\n122 Ibid.\n123 Harriet Moynihan, above n.58, 17-18; Hao Yeli, A Three-Perspective Theory of Cyber Sovereignty, 7 (2) PRISM (2017), 109-115; Florian Kriener, Cyber Space, Sovereignty and the Intricacies of International Law-Making: Reflections on Germany's Position Paper on International Law in Cyberspace (Völkerrechtsblog, 16 April 2021) (https://voelkerrechtsblog.org/cyber-space-sovereignty-and-the-intricacies-of-international-law-making/).\n124 Harriet Moynihan, ibid., 21-24.\n125 Ibid., 4-5, 15-24; A.

State sovereignty violation: applicable law\n71. There is an increasing need for an international legal framework to address these challenges since traditional forms of State sovereignty are no longer adequate to meet the international character of cyberspace. The principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States is one of the keyways that international law is applied to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.¹³⁰\n72. The principle of non-intervention has been applied to address challenges such as cyber espionage and cyber assaults on State-controlled infrastructure.¹³¹ For example, the 2014 Sony Pictures hack has been deemed a violation of US sovereignty,¹³² illustrating how State sovereignty can be encroached upon in cyberspace and how international law can be employed to address such infringements. The US government attributed the attack to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), leading to the\n¹²⁹ Finland, ibid., 2; Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Grounded in the principle of non-intervention, the US government responded by imposing sanctions on the DPRK and taking other measures to hold its government accountable.¹³³ Hacking identified here as a type of cyber intrusion, was attributed by the US government to the DPRK. The US response, including the imposition of penalties, can be seen as an effort to hold the country accountable for its actions and discourage future cyber intrusions. The actions taken by the US also convey a message to other nations that cross-border intrusions will not be tolerated and will be met with a response.\n73. The principle of jurisdiction is another way in which international law applies to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. The power of a State to exercise control over a certain area or individuals is referred to as jurisdiction.¹³⁴ Jurisdiction in cyberspace may be a complicated problem since it is not always apparent where a certain cyber-related action is taking place or who is liable for it.\n74. Several revisions and adaptations may be required for the successful application of international law to violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace. One possible modification would be to explain the application to cyber activities of existing norms of international law, such as the principle of non-intervention. This modification could include the development of new legal interpretations or more detailed guidance on how these principles should be implemented in the context of cyberspace.¹³⁵ Another adaptation would be to create new legal tools or soft instruments that explicitly handle violations of State sovereignty in cyberspace.¹³⁶ A new legally binding document on State sovereignty in cyberspace could be developed by the relevant UN entities to set out explicit norms and principles for the safeguarding of State sovereignty in cyberspace.\n75.

Extraterritorial effects and international law\n76. Having explored the legal matters and relevant laws concerning violations of State sovereignty, another noteworthy aspect pertains to the impact of cyberspace, where multiple principles may come into play, causing cross-border implications. Consequently, this section delves into crucial facets surrounding the contemporary enforcement of international law within the cyberspace domain. It not only explores the legal complexities of extraterritorial effects but also examines how international law could potentially be employed to address this legal challenge. However, applying traditional principles such as territorial jurisdiction proves challenging in a borderless cyberspace. The nationality principle, often invoked in cases involving the citizenship of the perpetrator, is complex in the context of the digital realm. Additionally, issues of State responsibility and human rights further complicate the jurisdictional landscape, requiring a careful approach to navigate the complexities of governing cyber activities.\n## IV.A. Extraterritorial effects: the legal issue\n77. The principle of extraterritoriality is addressed in the negative rather than the positive context. Typically, any legal action taken by a State impacts the region under its control. At times, the acts of one State may have an impact on the activities of another or within another territory and beyond its legislative jurisdiction.¹³⁹\n78. The question of jurisdiction is a critical one. One of the interesting types of core principles related to extraterritorial effects is the nationality\nWrongful Acts 2001, Yearbook of the International Law Commission 2001, vol. II (part Two), A/56/49 (Vol. I)/Corr.4.\n138 Constantine Antonopoulos, ibid., 115-119; André Nollkaemper and Dov Jacobs, Shared Responsibility in International law: A Conceptual Framework, 34 Michigan JIL (2013), 359; Nicholas Tsagourias and Michael Farrell, Cyber Attribution: Legal and Technical Approaches and Challenges, 31 EJIL (2020), 953-955.\n139 Hannah L. Buxbaum, The Practice(s) of Extraterritoriality, in: Hannah L. Buxbaum and Thibaut Fleury Graff (eds.), Extraterritoriality (2022), 3.\nChinese JIL (2024)\nprinciple. The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location.¹⁴⁰ It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.¹⁴¹\n79. In the context of cyberspace, the nationality principle plays a significant role in addressing the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities. Cyber operations conducted by individuals or entities who are nationals of a particular State may have effects that extend beyond that State's borders, potentially impacting other States and their interests.¹⁴² This raises questions about the application of international law to such cyber operations and whether they may be considered extraterritorial.\n80. The nationality principle serves as a legal basis for States to assert jurisdiction over cyber activities conducted by their nationals, even if the effects of those activities are felt outside their territory.¹⁴³ This principle allows States to exercise their regulatory authority and apply their laws to address the potential harm caused by cyber operations carried out by their citizens abroad.¹⁴⁴ By doing so, the nationality principle helps mitigate the extraterritorial effects of cyber activities and provides a means for States to address cyber threats that originate from their nationals.\n81. In connection with the application of international law to cyberspace, the nationality principle can be relevant in determining which State has jurisdiction over specific cyber incidents and whether a State has the right to\n140 Kenneth S.

A State’s jurisdiction is typically established by its territorial boundaries in the physical world. However, because data and communications can be carried and stored across borders, determining the location of a specific action or participant in cyberspace can be challenging. This has led some to argue that traditional ideas of jurisdiction are unsuitable for the digital environment and that new approaches are required to ensure that international law successfully governs cyberspace.¹⁴⁷ In other words, one of the primary causes for extraterritorial spread is the advancement of cyber technology in activities where physical location is not the key jurisdictional factor.¹⁴⁸ Many cyber acts, such as internet-based defamation, are difficult to pinpoint geographically, or they may occur in many places. As a result, regardless of the physical location of the acts or effects, States may enact laws that assert jurisdiction with global reach,¹⁴⁹ and its consequences may be deemed as serious crimes under international law.¹⁵⁰ The focus may shift to the impact of the act, implying that domestic legislation within the country may have cross-border effects.\n145 Darrel C Menthe, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace: A Theory of International Spaces, 1 Michigan Telecommunications and Technology LR (1998), 71-73, 97-100.\n146 Ibid.; Maxron Holder, Cyberspace in a State of Flux: Regulating Cyberspace through International Law, 9(2) Groningen JIL (2022), 266, 273-274, 277.\n147 Michael N.

Belgium), ICJ Reports 2002, 10-11.\nChinese JIL (2024)\n83. Another facet of international law's extraterritorial effects in cyberspace concerns the issue of State responsibility. States have an obligation under international law to avoid interfering with the rights of other States and to compensate victims for their illegal conduct. Activities may be carried out by non-State actors, require the use of intermediaries, or involve routing through multiple States.\n84. There are several concerns about the extraterritorial applicability of domestic laws in cyberspace. Although domestic laws typically apply solely inside the borders of a single State, in the context of cyberspace, data and communications can be sent and stored across multiple countries, making it difficult to decide which laws should apply to conduct. This has prompted requests for more international collaboration to guarantee that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws does not result in disputes or violations of international law.^^\n85. The problem of extraterritoriality of domestic law in cyberspace is closely linked to the subject of human rights in cyberspace. The internet and other digital technologies have considerably increased individuals' capacity to interact and receive information but have also generated concerns about privacy, free speech, and other fundamental rights.\n86. Extraterritoriality is not addressed in the GGE report, even though it is a problem with serious consequences, specifically in respect of ICT-related activities. There may be active hacking of a computer system that is physically hosted on a server located beyond the territorial limits of one State,^^ and that would harm a computer system located on the territory of another. Alternatively, States may create domestic legislation to cope with cyber concerns that develop within their borders. This gives rise to obligations, such as creating procedures for operating in cyberspace that may influence other States even without accessing their territory. This would result in a State being subject to the domestic law restrictions of other States otherwise limited to the territory of those other States.\n87. In conclusion, the extraterritorial impacts of domestic law in cyberspace are increasingly complicated and have grown major implications for jurisdiction, State responsibility, extraterritorial application, and human rights. While legal academics and practitioners continue to argue the optimal\n^^ Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, above n.75, 154-158 and 165-167.\n^^ Mireille Hildebrandt, *Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to Enforce in Cyberspace?

Many international and regional legislation, policies, and recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.\n## IV.B. Extraterritorial effects: applicable law\n88. Extraterritorial effects in cyberspace have expanded in recent years, as the internet and other digital technologies have enabled individuals and non-State entities to operate beyond national borders.^^ There is an increasing need for international legal frameworks to handle these challenges, as traditional notions of State sovereignty may no longer be adequate, given the global nature of cyberspace.\n89. There are several examples of international law being used to address extraterritorial effects in cyberspace.\n90. The WannaCry ransomware outbreak in May 2017 is one example of the use of international law.^^ The attack disrupted hospitals, businesses, and government agencies in over 150 countries, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers. Many States and cybersecurity experts blamed the hack on the DPRK's government.^^ The UN Security Council (UNSC) has passed several resolutions and issued statements on cyber security and international law, including UNSC Resolution 2341 (2017), which recognizes\n153 Hannah L.

Another example is the Stuxnet worm.¹⁵⁸ As mentioned above, the worm, identified in 2010, was developed to target and disrupt the control systems of industrial facilities, notably nuclear sites in Iran.¹⁵⁹ While the identity of the attacker is not explicitly stated, it is important to note that Iran has its perspective on the origin of the attack. The Stuxnet worm is thought to have had extraterritorial effects since it damaged the control systems of industrial facilities in Iran from outside that State’s borders. This was considered a violation of Iranian sovereignty since the worm was allowed to function on Iranian territory without the consent of authorities. International law is applicable to this incident, offering a framework for the extraterritorial effects of action in cyberspace. As previously stated, the UN Charter, especially the principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality, prohibits States from asserting jurisdiction over another State’s territory without its consent.¹⁶⁰\n92. The existing international legal system provides a framework for dealing with extraterritoriality in cyberspace, but it is not without constraints. The UN Charter’s principles of non-intervention and sovereign equality offer a basis for doing so,¹⁶¹ but due to the unique character of cyberspace, such as the difficulties in determining the origin and responsibility of a cyber-related action, applying these principles can be problematic.

A State’s reaction to extraterritorial impacts like cyber espionage and cyber-attacks might also be hampered by a lack of agreement on how to interpret and implement international law in cyberspace.\n93. Overcoming these limitations requires that the existing international legal framework for cyberspace be maintained and strengthened. This can be accomplished by negotiating new legally enforceable instruments, such as draft articles on State jurisdiction over cyber activities, or by developing soft law instruments, such as guidelines or recommendations.¹⁶² States should also continue to collaborate to build shared understandings and norms of responsible State behavior in cyberspace; this can aid in clarifying the application of international law in this setting.\n## V. Cyberspace sovereignty and international law\n94. This section represents the core legal concern pertaining to the applicability of international law in the realm of cyberspace. It explores the progressive matter of cyberspace sovereignty, a subject that is infrequently examined within a broader framework. Within this section, the notion of cyberspace sovereignty is introduced, along with its associated legal intricacies, while also addressing how international law could potentially be relevant in navigating this novel domain of sovereignty.\n## V.A. Cyberspace sovereignty: the legal issue\n95. Sovereignty is traditionally understood as a territorial concept,¹⁶³ entailing a State’s exclusive control over its territory, populace, and domestic affairs.¹⁶⁴ On the other hand, jurisdiction expands beyond territorial borders\n---\n162 Marco Roscini, above n.90, 307-308; Katharina Ziolkowski, above n.109, 135, 174; Michael N.

Sovereignty, rooted in the Westphalian system, is the bedrock of international law, emphasizing a State’s exclusive control within its territorial boundaries.¹⁶⁶ It entails the supreme authority of a State over its domestic affairs, encompassing governance, laws, and enforcement mechanisms. Traditionally, sovereignty was a territorial concept, asserting that a State has the right to govern its territory and protect its national interests.¹⁶⁷\n97. Yochai Benkler’s Three-Layer Internet Model presents a theoretical framework for understanding the evolving structure of the internet. The model encompasses three distinct layers: the physical infrastructure layer, the logical layer, and the content layer.¹⁶⁸ The physical infrastructure layer involves the tangible hardware and network components that enable data transmission.¹⁶⁹ The logical layer involves the protocols and standards that govern data transmission, while the content layer comprises the information, data, and services accessible to users.¹⁷⁰\n98. As the internet has become an essential part of modern societies, States have sought to assert control over cyberspace, giving rise to the concept of cyber sovereignty. Cyber sovereignty refers to a State’s desire and efforts to assert control and regulation over the virtual realm, including internet access, content, and data flow within its borders.¹⁷¹ While cyberspace transcends\n165 John M.

The functioning of cyberspace does not rely upon a single ICT infrastructure in one territory; rather, it requires extensive cooperation and interconnection with other ICT infrastructures globally.¹⁷³ Cyberspace is a borderless and interconnected domain that operates across multiple jurisdictions, and its seamless functioning depends on the collaboration between different countries and their respective ICT systems. The Internet, as a core component of cyberspace, is a network of networks that spans the globe, and each network’s smooth operation is interdependent on the functioning of others.¹⁷⁴ This interconnection ensures data transfer, communication, and accessibility across borders, facilitating the exchange of information and services on a global scale.\n100. Cooperation among various stakeholders is crucial in maintaining the stability and functionality of cyberspace. Governments, private companies, internet service providers, and technical organisations work together to develop and implement technical standards, policies, and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet and cyberspace.¹⁷⁵ Additionally, international agreements and treaties facilitate cooperation on issues such as cybersecurity, data protection, and intellectual property rights. This collaborative approach fosters an inclusive and interconnected cyberspace, ensuring that it remains a valuable and essential tool for communication, innovation, and economic growth on a global scale.\n(Council on Foreign Relations, 30 October 2019) (https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty); Anqi Wang, Cyber Sovereignty at Its Boldest: A Chinese Perspective, 16(2) The Ohio State Technology Law Journal (2020), 403-417.\n172 Milton Mueller, Sovereignty and Cyberspace: Institutions and Internet Governance (Regulation and Governance, 2018) (https://www.intgovforum.org/sites/default/files/webform/week13-cyberspace-sovereignty.pdf); Ali Shoker, Digital Sovereignty Strategies for Every Nation, 1(1) Applied Cybersecurity &amp; Internet Governance (2022), 6-9; Sam Wood et al., Digital Sovereignty: the Overlap and Conflict between States, Enterprises and Citizens (2020), 5-7.\n173 Tomasz Zdikot, Cyberspace and Cybersecurity, in: Katarzyna Chałubińska-Jentkiewicz et al.

In cyberspace, the involvement of non-State actors plays a significant role in shaping its governance and technical aspects. One notable example of a non-State actor in cyberspace governance is the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).¹⁷⁶ The IETF is a global community of experts, engineers, and researchers who develop and promote voluntary standards and protocols that govern the operation of the Internet, including the Internet Protocol (IP).¹⁷⁷ This open and collaborative organization operates independently of any government and allows various stakeholders to contribute to the development and maintenance of internet standards.\n102. The IETF’s role in shaping the technical foundations of cyberspace exemplifies the influence of non-State actors in the functioning of the digital realm.¹⁷⁸ As an inclusive and decentralized organisation, the IETF invites contributions from individuals, academics, private sector entities, and governments, ensuring a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance.¹⁷⁹ While State actors also participate in the IETF’s discussions, its decision-making processes are transparent and open to all, allowing non-State actors to have a meaningful impact on the development and evolution of internet standards.¹⁸⁰ This involvement of non-State actors in shaping cyberspace underscores the dynamic and diverse nature of governance in the digital age.\n103. Beyond the jurisdiction of States, the functioning of the internet is partially controlled by various entities, both governmental and non-governmental, operating in the cyberspace arena. One significant non-governmental entity that exerts influence over internet governance is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).¹⁸¹ ICANN is responsible for managing and coordinating the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates domain names into numerical IP addresses.¹⁸² This coordination ensures the stable and secure functioning of the internet, and it is\n176 Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Introduction to the IETF (https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/).\n177 Ibid.\n178 Ibid.\n179 Ibid., Group (https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/).\n180 Jacqueline Eggenschwiler, Non-State Actors and Norms of Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace (2020), 236, 315.\n181 Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), ICANN for Beginners (https://www.icann.org/en/beginners).\n182 Ibid.; Jacqueline Eggenschwiler, above n.180, 236, 238, 315.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 65\nconducted through a multi-stakeholder model involving diverse stakeholders from different countries and sectors.\n104. In addition to ICANN, various private technology corporations, such as major internet service providers and tech giants, hold significant control over the functioning of the internet beyond State jurisdiction.¹⁸³ These corporations own and operate vast portions of the internet infrastructure, including data centers, communication networks, and cloud computing services. Their actions and policies can have far-reaching impacts on the accessibility, privacy, and security of cyberspace.¹⁸⁴ Furthermore, some technology companies have been involved in content moderation and censorship decisions, which can influence the free flow of information on the internet.¹⁸⁵ The multi-faceted involvement of both non-governmental organizations like ICANN and private corporations in shaping the functioning of the internet highlights the complex and evolving landscape of cyberspace sovereignty.\n105. Activities in cyberspace might have an impact on sovereignty and have extraterritorial effects. However, some propose separating cyberspace from domestic law, as Chinese President Xi Jinping did when emphasizing the idea of cyber sovereignty.¹⁸⁶ In general discussions of jurisdiction, the\n183 Hongfei Gu, Data, Big Tech, and the New Concept of Sovereignty, Journal of Chinese Political Science (2023), 1-22.\n184 Ibid.\n185 See for example, Maxwell Timothy, Big Tech Censorship: What Is It and Why Should You Be Concerned?

A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n106. Cyberspace sovereignty is defined as\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).¹⁸⁷\nCyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.¹⁸⁸\n107. The unique character of cyberspace is one of the major obstacles in resolving the question of cyberspace sovereignty. Cyberspace is a virtual world with no physical boundaries that is continually expanding and changing. There is no obvious method to define or delimit cyberspace, and authorities thus find it difficult to impose control over the internet within their borders. Furthermore, because the Internet is a global network, no single State can establish authority over the whole.\n108. Another challenge to addressing cyberspace sovereignty is the lack of established international legal rules and principles that apply to cyberspace. There are a few international agreements and conventions dealing with\nCreemers, China’s Conception of Cyber Sovereignty: Rhetoric and Realization, in: Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg, Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (2020), 107-144; Binxing Fang, above n.73, v.\n¹⁸⁷ Binxing Fang, above n.73, 78.\n¹⁸⁸ Ibid., 84.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 67\ninternet issues, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁸⁹ and the UN Cybercrime treaty,¹⁹⁰ but a clear consensus on how these agreements should be universally applied to the unique dynamics of cyberspace is lacking.\n109. It is possible to argue that ICT threats may have consequences ranging from State sovereignty to cyberspace sovereignty. The concept of State sovereignty in international law is significant because sovereignty in relation to territories, populations, and regimes inside its territory is relevant to cyberspace.\n110. In the context of cyber operations, the Three-Layer Internet Model aids in understanding the implications of different activities on State sovereignty.¹⁹¹ Low-level cyber operations, such as passive information gathering, may not necessarily violate sovereignty, as they do not involve significant intrusion or disruption.¹⁹² However, high-level cyber operations, like cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure or disinformation campaigns, can directly challenge a State's sovereignty by jeopardizing its ability to govern and protect its population.¹⁹³\n111. The distinction between cyber sovereignty and traditional sovereignty has led States to adopt different approaches to addressing cyber operations.¹⁹⁴ Some States prioritize cyber controls and restrictions to safeguard their interests within the virtual domain. For instance, China's Great Firewall exemplifies a cyber sovereignty approach, where the State enforces strict controls over internet access and content to maintain political stability.¹⁹⁵\n189 Convention on Cybercrime (adopted 23 November 2001, entered into force 1 July 2004) ETS 185 (Budapest Convention).\n190 United Nations General Assembly, 74/247 Countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes (20 January 2020), UN Doc.

The concepts of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and cyber sovereignty represent distinct layers of authority in the digital age. Sovereignty remains anchored in territorial control, jurisdiction extends beyond borders, and cyber sovereignty emerges as States grapple with regulating the virtual realm. Understanding the implications of different cyber operations on State sovereignty is crucial for crafting effective cyber policies and fostering international cooperation in the digital era. By incorporating the Three-Layer Internet Model, policymakers can navigate the complexities of cyberspace and strike a balance between safeguarding sovereignty and fostering an open and secure global Internet environment.\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n113. International law applies to cyberspace sovereignty in several ways, primarily. One of the primary means is through the principle of State sovereignty, which affirms the ability of States to govern and control their territory. This argument is used to explain States' regulation and control of the internet within their borders,¹⁹⁶ which includes the capacity to restrict or prohibit certain websites, manage online material, and respond to cyber threats emanating from within their borders.\n114. Another way international law applies to internet sovereignty is through the principle of non-intervention in other States' internal affairs.¹⁹⁷ This principle is employed to defend governments' capacity to respond to cyber threats that originate beyond their borders, such as through defensive cyber operations or the imposition of penalties against foreign entities.\n115. International treaties and agreements also allow the application of international law to cyberspace sovereignty. The ICCPR, for example,\nterpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways); Jessica Baron, Cyber-Sovereignty and China's Great Firewall: An Interview With James Griffiths (Forbes, 8 April 2019) (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2019/04/08/cyber-sovereignty-and-chinas-great-firewall-an-interview-with-james-griffiths/?sh=2c0c9a43747b).\n196 Michael N.

The ICCPR, one of the most important international instruments for protecting human rights online, has direct relevance to the issue of cyberspace sovereignty. Article 19 of the ICCPR preserves the right to free speech and prohibits arbitrary privacy infringements.²⁰⁰ These rights are directly relevant to cyberspace since they safeguard people’s capacity to access and distribute information online without intervention from authorities.²⁰¹ The ICCPR also acknowledges the right to peaceful assembly, which applies to online gatherings such as demonstrations and social media campaigns.²⁰² Article 17 of the ICCPR prohibits arbitrary or unlawful intervention with privacy, which is directly relevant to cyberspace.²⁰³ The right to privacy includes the right to have personal data protected and is especially important in the internet environment, where massive amounts of personal data are gathered, kept, and shared.²⁰⁴\n117. International treaties like the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime²⁰⁵ (BCC) establish frameworks for dealing with cybercrime. The BCC is an important international mechanism for the application of\n198 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, art.19.\n199 United Nations Human Rights Council, The promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the internet (27 June 2016), A/HRC/32/L.20, para.1; NATO, Warsaw Summit Communiqué (Press Release, 9 July 2016) (https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_133169.htm), para.70; G8, G8 Summit of Deauville, Declaration: Renewed Commitment for Freedom and Democracy (26-27 May 2021) (https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2011_05/20110926_110526-G8-Summit-Deauville.pdf), para.II/11; Case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs.²⁰⁶ This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n118. The BCC also addresses the topic of cyberspace sovereignty through its rules and framework for international collaboration among governments in the investigation and prosecution of cybercrime.²⁰⁷ Such collaboration involves information exchange, mutual assistance in investigations, and extradition of suspects to guarantee that States can address cybercrime effectively, especially when it crosses national borders.²⁰⁸ The BCC also establishes a framework for criminalizing a wide range of cybercrimes, including unauthorized access, computer-related fraud, and the creation and distribution of harmful software.²⁰⁹ This criminalization allows States to prosecute cybercriminals and safeguard their populations from cybercrime. The BCC also specifies that State parties have the authority to collect electronic evidence,²¹⁰ allowing them to ensure that evidence is lawfully collected and acceptable in court, thereby ensuring that cybercriminals are brought to justice.\n119. Despite the existence of the BCC, the absence of direct legislation for cyberspace creates challenges. The international legal system, guided by principles such as State sovereignty and non-intervention in the affairs of other States, lacks a well-defined framework to handle the complexities of cyberspace. While the UN Charter and other international agreements, which touch upon issues of sovereignty and self-defense,²¹¹ can be invoked to legitimize State actions safeguarding national security interests in cyberspace, they\n206 Ibid., art. 22.\n207 Ibid., arts. 23-27.\n208 Ibid.\n209 Ibid., arts. 7-8.\n210 Ibid., arts. 20-21.\n211 UN Charter, art. 51.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71\ndo not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.\n120. Consequently, the issue of cyberspace sovereignty is complicated, necessitating a diversified approach. While existing international law can be utilized to address some of the challenges, new norms and principles are required to accommodate the unique qualities of cyberspace. Soft law can also help promote collaboration and shape State conduct in cyberspace. However, a key difficulty that must be addressed is the lack of clear and uniform international legal standards and principles that apply.\n## VI. Conclusion\n121. In an era of widespread technological proliferation and evolution, the imperative to establish comprehensive international laws for the digital realm, known as cyberspace, has become increasingly pronounced. The crux of this argument rests upon the recognition that the challenges posed by this intricate landscape demand tailored legal frameworks. Central to these challenges are matters of State sovereignty, extraterritoriality, and the notion of cyberspace sovereignty.\n122. The limitations of current international legal structures become glaringly apparent in the context of cyberspace. State sovereignty violations, a prevalent concern in this realm, materialize when one State's actions infringe upon the sovereign rights of another. These violations can encompass a range of activities, from infiltrating a nation's digital infrastructure to orchestrating cyber-attacks that disrupt vital services. These actions can yield extraterritorial effects, impinging on the affairs of States far beyond the originating entity's physical boundaries. The transnational nature of cyberspace also facilitates the spread of threats, such as virus dissemination and personal data theft, across international borders. This underscores the necessity of asserting control over the virtual territories, paving the way for the concept of cyberspace sovereignty—the ability of governments to manage information flow within their digital borders and safeguard their cyber assets.\n123. The inadequacies of current international law in addressing cyberspace complexities are evident. While some existing laws, such as the UN Charter governing the use of force between States, can be construed to encompass certain cyber activities, they often fall short of capturing the full scope of this digital domain. The Tallinn Manual, a legal guide on the\nChinese JIL (2024)\napplication of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.²¹²\n124. Further interpreting existing laws, though a plausible endeavor, proves insufficient when confronting the intricacies of cyberspace. The fluidity of digital operations and the evolving nature of cyber threats demand a bespoke legal framework. Attempting to graft these new complexities onto preexisting legal structures risks dilution and inconsistency. Therefore, the development of dedicated international laws tailored to cyberspace is imperative to effectively address contemporary State behaviors and resolve disputes in this novel realm.\n125. While the creation of a new international legal framework for cyberspace presents a daunting task, its necessity is undeniable. Emerging technologies and expanding internet access increase the potential for conflicts and disruptions. The absence of unified regulations fosters an environment in which States operate without constraints, potentially undermining mutual respect and global stability. Although the path to crafting and adopting such laws may be arduous, the urgency of these challenges compels the international community to collaboratively establish robust and effective regulations that will shape the future landscape of responsible State behavior in cyberspace. It is essential to note that while this article focuses on the involvement of States, the role of non-State actors in cyberspace should not be overlooked.\n²¹² Michael N.

Cyber-attacks targeting key infrastructure can undermine sovereignty by aiding another State's territorial control. The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.\n# I.

In this regard, the Group of Governmental Experts (GGEs) on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace is a United Nations body comprising experts from member States, tasked with studying the responsible use of ICTs within international security.¹⁰ The GGEs analyze cyberspace challenges, contribute to norms development, and provide guidance on State behavior, thus shaping global efforts to establish a rules-based framework for responsible conduct in the digital realm. Their work influences international discourse on cyber norms and law, fostering stability and cooperation in cyberspace.¹¹ Even though the report of the GGEs is not a legally enforceable document, it is directly relevant to State behavior in cyberspace.¹² Its positions are recommendations only, with efforts undertaken to make these voluntary, non-binding norms.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 29\n\nPure Sovereignty in Cyberspace, 5 February 2024 (https://opiniojuris.org/2024/02/05/the-african-union-rightly-endorses-pure-sovereignty-in-cyberspace/).\n\nChinese JIL (2024) extent?

For instance, from the Russian military's perspective, cyber operations encompass a broad range of activities aimed at achieving military, political, or economic objectives through cyberspace. These actions may include intelligence gathering, influence campaigns, and electronic warfare.³¹ Similarly, China's military doctrine recognizes the significance of information operations, with a focus on strategic deception, psychological warfare, and gaining information dominance through cyberspace.³² Chinese JIL (2024) manipulation that leads to denial that appears in a physical domain, and is considered a form of fires\".36 Chatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 35 cyber-attacks effectively.

Principle of non-intervention Chinese JIL (2024) autonomy. While distinguishing between pressure and coercion can sometimes be subtle, the key factor is the degree to which a State's sovereignty is eroded, and its capacity for independent decision-making is curtailed. Under international law, no State is permitted to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another. The strength of the non-intervention principle lies in its adaptability to technological processes, encompassing not only territorial integrity but also the development, application, and interpretation of the principle across a wide range of actions. Applying the principle of non-intervention to cyberspace involves recognizing States' sovereignty over their cyber territory and activities, prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of other States, and demanding respect for their sovereignty. \n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 45 integrity,⁹⁰ including initiating a cyber-attack against another’s critical infrastructure or military systems or launching a cyber-attack against another’s territory.\n\n## II.B.iii. Principle of prohibition of the use of force\n\nThe GGE report, however, stated unequivocally that, in their use of ICTs, and as per the Charter of the United Nations, States shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the purpose of the United Nations.⁹³ Thus, the application of ICT can lead to a violation of the use of force outlined in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter; cyber activities may be deemed a use of force in the cyber domain⁹⁴ as they inherently cause harm in two distinct Chinese JIL (2024) ways. While the application of physical force inflicts damage through kinetic means, cyber operations may also result in harm and casualties.⁹⁵ It is essential to note that the term “kinetic force” is not synonymous with “armed force”; the former refers to the physical motion of objects, while the latter involves the application of weapons or military means. Drawing a parallel, actions such as diverting water to another State’s territory or neglecting to prevent its flow does not inherently involve kinetic force but may have comparable consequences. If such actions were considered a use of force, the victim State would likely be entitled to respond in accordance with the established principles of self-defense.\n\nCommonwealth &amp; Development Office, Application of international law to states’ conduct in cyberspace: UK statement (UK: Policy Paper, 3 June 2021) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement/application-of-international-law-to-states-conduct-in-cyberspace-uk-statement); HM Government, National Cyber Security Strategy 2016-2021 (2016) (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf).\n⁹⁵ Michael N.

The nationality principle, also known as the principle of nationality, is a fundamental concept in international law that pertains to the jurisdictional reach of a State over its nationals, regardless of their location.¹⁴⁰ It is based on the notion that a State has the authority to apply its laws and regulations to its citizens, irrespective of whether they are within its territory or abroad. The nationality principle is commonly applied in various legal contexts, including criminal law, taxation, and diplomatic protection.¹⁴¹ Chatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 57 respond to cyber operations that have an impact on its interests.¹⁴⁵ This principle helps establish a link between the State and the conduct of its nationals in cyberspace, enabling the State to assert its rights and responsibilities concerning the activities of its citizens in the digital realm.¹⁴⁶ However, the application of the nationality principle in cyberspace can be complex, particularly when cyber operations involve multiple actors and cross-border effects, leading to debates on the scope and limitations of the jurisdiction in the digital domain.\n\nChinese JIL (2024) ^[151]^ Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, above n.75, 154-158 and 165-167.\n^[152]^ Mireille Hildebrandt, *Extraterritorial Jurisdiction to Enforce in Cyberspace?

A State’s reaction to extraterritorial impacts like cyber espionage and cyber-attacks might also be hampered by a lack of agreement on how to interpret and implement international law in cyberspace.\n\n## V. Cyberspace sovereignty and international law\n\n## V.A. Cyberspace sovereignty: the legal issue\n\n--- Chinese JIL (2024) and encompasses various principles, including the nationality principle, which grants States authority over their citizens regardless of their location.¹⁶⁵ In the digital era, the emergence of cyberspace has introduced new challenges, leading to the notion of cyber sovereignty, where States assert control over the virtual realm.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 63 physical borders, States increasingly assert control over online activities within their territory, reflecting their quest for digital governance.¹⁷² (Council on Foreign Relations, 30 October 2019) (https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-much-cyber-sovereignty-too-much-cyber-sovereignty); Anqi Wang, Cyber Sovereignty at Its Boldest: A Chinese Perspective, 16(2) The Ohio State Technology Law Journal (2020), 403-417.\n\nChinese JIL (2024) Chatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 65 conducted through a multi-stakeholder model involving diverse stakeholders from different countries and sectors.\n\nChinese JIL (2024) territory is defined as the area in which States can exercise their sovereignty. A State's network is the ICT infrastructure comprised of ICT systems constructed on its territory.\n\na natural extension of state sovereignty in the cyberspace hosted by the ICT infrastructure located in the territory of a state; namely, a state has jurisdiction (right to interfere in data operation) over ICT activities (in respect of cyber roles and operations) present in cyberspace, ICT systems per se (in respect of facilities), and data carried by the ICT systems (virtual assets).¹⁸⁷ Cyberspace sovereignty is described as an extension of a State's sovereignty into the digital realm, encompassing the ICT infrastructure situated within its borders. This suggests that a State has the authority to intervene in data operations over activities specific to cyberspace. Examples of such activities include vital cyber functions, the operation of ICT systems, and the transmission of data, which are unique to the digital domain. Furthermore, the State's sovereignty extends to ICT systems themselves in terms of facilities and the data transmitted by these systems as virtual assets. This definition implies the existence of sovereignty in cyberspace, giving rise to corresponding rights and responsibilities. When cyberspace is considered a territory, the State holds fundamental rights in this domain, encompassing cyberspace independence, equality, self-defense, and jurisdiction.¹⁸⁸ Creemers, China’s Conception of Cyber Sovereignty: Rhetoric and Realization, in: Dennis Broeders and Bibi van den Berg, Governing Cyberspace: Behavior, Power, and Diplomacy (2020), 107-144; Binxing Fang, above n.73, v.\n¹⁸⁷ Binxing Fang, above n.73, 78.\n¹⁸⁸ Ibid., 84.\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 67 internet issues, such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹⁸⁹ and the UN Cybercrime treaty,¹⁹⁰ but a clear consensus on how these agreements should be universally applied to the unique dynamics of cyberspace is lacking.\n\nChinese JIL (2024)\n\n## V.B. Cyberspace sovereignty: applicable law\n\nterpreter/cyber-sovereignty-cuts-both-ways); Jessica Baron, Cyber-Sovereignty and China's Great Firewall: An Interview With James Griffiths (Forbes, 8 April 2019) (https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessicabaron/2019/04/08/cyber-sovereignty-and-chinas-great-firewall-an-interview-with-james-griffiths/?sh=2c0c9a43747b).\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 69 recognizes the right to free expression and the prohibition of arbitrary intervention with privacy,¹⁹⁸ both of which are relevant in cyberspace.¹⁹⁹ Chinese JIL (2024) international law to the topic of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC is the first legally enforceable instrument that expressly addresses cybercrime, establishing a framework for State collaboration in the fight against cybercrime. The BCC's rules on jurisdiction are one of the primary ways by which it addresses the problem of cyberspace sovereignty. The BCC empowers governments to exert jurisdiction over cybercrimes committed within their borders as well as those committed by their citizens, regardless of where the crime occurs.²⁰⁶ This enables States to prosecute cybercriminals operating within their borders, even if the crimes are committed outside their jurisdiction, thereby helping ensure that States can exercise their sovereignty in cyberspace and take measures to safeguard their citizens from cybercrime.\n\nChatinakrob, Interplay of International Law and Cyberspace 71 do not offer a clearly defined structure for dealing with matters related to cyberspace sovereignty.\n\n## VI. Conclusion\n\nChinese JIL (2024) application of international law to cyber warfare, offers valuable insights but does not encompass the broad spectrum of cyberspace challenges.²¹² ²¹² Michael N.

These threats, emanating from State and non-State actors, endanger economic growth, societal well-being, and human safety. The existing international legal framework struggles to adequately confront these challenges, resulting in issues concerning State sovereignty, cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure, and the Assistant Professor of International Law, Assistant Dean for Education and Director of LLB (Evening Degree Program), Tha Phrachan, the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University, Thailand; email: thanapatch@tu.ac.th.

Cyber-attacks targeting key infrastructure can undermine sovereignty by aiding another State's territorial control. The enforcement of cyberspace legislation, whether regional or intra-State, can infringe upon other States' sovereignty due to cross-border repercussions. Despite the presence of numerous international and regional regulations, enforcement remains lacking. The concept of cyberspace sovereignty has arisen with technological advancements, signifying a need for digital realm sovereignty. Yet, this form of sovereignty is narrower compared to territorial sovereignty. This article delves into the nexus between international law, State sovereignty, and ICT threats, along with the progression of cyberspace sovereignty. Through qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources, it examines the application of existing international law in the digital landscape. By scrutinizing these intricacies, the paper endeavors to comprehend the contemporary challenges posed to international law and explore potential resolutions.",
