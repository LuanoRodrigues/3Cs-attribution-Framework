In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement\n1. Introduction\nThe beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict\n¹ Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.\ncritical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries.² This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony,³ seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n² See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n³ See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021.⁴ The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”.⁵ These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.⁶\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability.⁷ Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security.⁸ The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace.⁹ If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n⁴ See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n⁵ See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n⁶ See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n⁷ See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n⁸ See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n⁹ See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.¹⁰\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor.¹¹ Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process.¹² In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.¹³\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack.¹⁴ In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.¹⁵\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n¹⁰ The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

[creating] potential to misread the intentions of other states that could unnecessarily lead to escalation\".16\nIn addition, the absence of a clear regulation of the limits of operations that can be conducted peacetime and wartime leads states to explore \"gray zones\" between these two stages.[17] By definition, gray zone operations take advantage of loopholes and ambiguities in international law and principles.[18] This strategy is present in all five strategic domains, but the fundamental characteristics of cyberspace - mentioned above - enhance its use.[19]\nWhen it comes to combating cybercrime, it is possible to notice a clear effort of international cooperation and the creation of norms and institutions. One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001.[20] Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years.[21] Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse.[22] The main criticism involving the publication of\n[16] See supra note 14.\n[17] See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[18] See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n[19] See supra note 14, at 76.\n[20] See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n[21] See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[22] The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n5\nthe manual was the low variety of the group of approximately twenty specialists responsible for the work - which was mainly composed by American, Canadian and Western European experts.\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict.²³ Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”.²⁴ Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.²⁵\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.²⁶\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n²³ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n²⁴ See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n27 See United Nations, Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/RES/73/266, p. 6 (2021).\n28 See Paul Meyer, Incremental Progress or Circular Motion? – The UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) Report 2021, https://ict4peace.org/activities/ict4peace-commentary-on-final-un-gge-2021-report/ (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n7\nof an institution capable of regulating cyber operations, but as noted, they are still very incipient. It is argued here that the difficulty in creating an institution with international credibility to regulate cyberspace, as well as the lack of consensus and the creation of accountability mechanisms, which mark the criticisms of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the UN GGE Report, are direct reflections of the status quo of the international system, which will be better addressed in the next section.\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests.²⁹ However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt.³⁰ Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions.³¹ Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis.³² In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.³³\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”.³⁴ This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n²⁹ See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n³⁰ See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n³¹ See supra note 3.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system.³⁵ As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy,³⁶ accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China.³⁷ As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century.³⁸ From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization.³⁹ Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union.⁴⁰ The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively.⁴¹ In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.⁴²\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.⁴³ In\n³⁵ See Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *Caos Sistêmico: A Crise da Hegemonia Norte-Americana e a Ascensão da China*, Unpublished Bachelor’s Thesis, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, p. 87 (2021).\n³⁶ See Oliver Stuenkel, *O mundo pós-Ocidental: Potências Emergentes e a Nova Ordem Global*, Zahar, p. 118 (2018).\n³⁷ See Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.⁴⁵\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century.⁴⁶ The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.⁴⁷\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.⁴⁸\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.⁴⁹\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n⁴⁴ See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n⁴⁵ See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n⁴⁶ See supra note 35.\n⁴⁷ See supra note 36.\n⁴⁸ Ibid.\n⁴⁹ See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n10\nchanges in its institutional structure. Therefore, in 2015, the Chinese Armed Forces created two new branches: the PLA Rocket Force, which is responsible for controlling China’s conventional and nuclear missiles, and the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (hereinafter referred to as PLASSF), which is responsible for space warfare, electronic warfare and cyber warfare. The PLASSF would, consequently, play the role of spearhead of the People’s Liberation Army with regard to the new battlefields of the 21st century,⁵⁰ materializing the Chinese commitment to developing its cyber capabilities, understanding them as important asymmetric weapons in the dispute for global power. Since the 1990s, China’s cyber warfare program has been developed and modernized so that Beijing can utilize cyber operations to achieve its long-term global goals,⁵¹ making China one of the world’s leading cyber powers.\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region.⁵² It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea.⁵³ Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades.⁵⁴ One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law.⁵⁵ Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n⁵⁰ See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² See Michael O.

In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)”⁵⁷ which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018.⁵⁸ Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.⁵⁹\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n⁵⁶ See supra note 22.\n⁵⁷ See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n⁵⁸ See K.

AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia.⁶¹ Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law\nThe process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.⁶²\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n⁶⁰ See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n⁶¹ See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n⁶² See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.⁶³\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State.⁶⁴ Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior,⁶⁵ since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc.⁶⁶ Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty.⁶⁷ The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities.⁶⁸ These behaviors have a negative impact on\n⁶³ See supra note 26.\n⁶⁴ See supra note 13.\n⁶⁵ See supra note 2.\n⁶⁶ See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁶⁷ See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n⁶⁸ See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n14\ninternational cooperation, intensifying “the nuclear security dilemma, which accelerates the arms race, resulting in the end of stability-enhancing arms control”⁶⁹\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense,⁷⁰ meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace,⁷¹ which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.⁷²\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.⁷³\n⁶⁹ See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n⁷⁰ See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁷¹ See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n⁷² See supra note 14.\n⁷³ See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n15\nSince the crisis that led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia, Moscow has been systematically accused of conducting of gray zone operations in Ukrainian territory, in order to achieve its political objectives without starting a conventional conflict. This strategy was changed in 2022, when Russia decided to militarily invade Ukrainian territory.⁷⁴ In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO officially announced that cyberattacks on a member country of the organization would trigger Article 5⁷⁵ of its treaty.⁷⁶\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico.⁷⁷ Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war.⁷⁸ China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.⁷⁹\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.⁸⁰\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n⁷⁴ See supra note 52.\n⁷⁵ Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”.

Therefore, based on the elements addressed throughout this research, it was possible to draw some conclusions about the relationship between the status quo of the international system and the creation of a cyberspace regulation process.\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17",

In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement\n1. Introduction\nThe beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict\n Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.\ncritical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries. This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony, seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021. The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”. These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability. Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security. The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace. If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor. Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process. In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack. In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001.[20] Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years.[21] Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse.[22] The main criticism involving the publication of\n[16] See supra note 14.\n[17] See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[18] See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n[19] See supra note 14, at 76.\n[20] See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n[21] See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[22] The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict. Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”. Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n Ibid.\n See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests. However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt. Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions. Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis. In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”. This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n See supra note 3.\n Ibid.\n See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system. As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy, accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China. As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century. From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization. Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union. The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively. In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century. The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n See supra note 35.\n See supra note 36.\n Ibid.\n See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region. It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea. Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades. One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law. Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n Ibid.\n See Michael O.

In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)” which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018. Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n See supra note 22.\n See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n See K. Zeng &amp; R. Wells et al., Bilateral Tensions, the Trade War, and US-China Trade Relations, 24(4) Business and Politics 399, 399-429 (2022).\n See Jeff Pao, New US Chip Ban Takes Tech War to Dire Next Level, https://asiatimes.com/2022/10/new-us-chip-ban-takes-tech-war-to-dire-next-level/ (accessed on November 8, 2022).\n\nThe trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (hereinafter referred to as the AUKUS) was established in 2021 with the aim of increasing security and development cooperation between the three countries. AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia. Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law\nThe process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State. Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior, since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc. Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty. The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities. These behaviors have a negative impact on\n See supra note 26.\n See supra note 13.\n See supra note 2.\n See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense, meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace, which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.\n See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n See supra note 14.\n See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico. Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war. China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n See supra note 52.\n Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”. See NATO, The North Atlantic Treaty, p. 1 (1949).\n See James Pearson &amp; Jonathan Landay, *Cyberattack on NATO Could Trigger Collective Defence Clause—official*, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/ (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Heather Saul, *US Pushed to Explain Allegations of NSA Spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff*, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-pushed-to-explain-allegations-of-nsa-spying-on-brazilian-president-dilma-rousseff-8795711.html (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Andy Greenberg, *How Not To Prevent a Cyberwar With Russia*, https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cyberwar-escalation-power-grid/ (accessed on November 19, 2022).\n See supra note 12.\n See supra note 26.\n\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17",

    "## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation": "In the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n² See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n³ See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021.⁴ The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”.⁵ These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.⁶\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability.⁷ Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security.⁸ The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace.⁹ If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n⁴ See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n⁵ See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n⁶ See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n⁷ See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n⁸ See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n⁹ See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.¹⁰\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor.¹¹ Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process.¹² In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.¹³\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack.¹⁴ In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.¹⁵\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n¹⁰ The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

[creating] potential to misread the intentions of other states that could unnecessarily lead to escalation\".16\nIn addition, the absence of a clear regulation of the limits of operations that can be conducted peacetime and wartime leads states to explore \"gray zones\" between these two stages. By definition, gray zone operations take advantage of loopholes and ambiguities in international law and principles. This strategy is present in all five strategic domains, but the fundamental characteristics of cyberspace - mentioned above - enhance its use.\nWhen it comes to combating cybercrime, it is possible to notice a clear effort of international cooperation and the creation of norms and institutions. One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001. Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years. Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse. The main criticism involving the publication of\n See supra note 14.\n See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n See supra note 14, at 76.\n See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n5\nthe manual was the low variety of the group of approximately twenty specialists responsible for the work - which was mainly composed by American, Canadian and Western European experts.\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict.²³ Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”.²⁴ Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.²⁵\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.²⁶\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n²³ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n²⁴ See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n27 See United Nations, Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/RES/73/266, p. 6 (2021).\n28 See Paul Meyer, Incremental Progress or Circular Motion? – The UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) Report 2021, https://ict4peace.org/activities/ict4peace-commentary-on-final-un-gge-2021-report/ (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n7\nof an institution capable of regulating cyber operations, but as noted, they are still very incipient. It is argued here that the difficulty in creating an institution with international credibility to regulate cyberspace, as well as the lack of consensus and the creation of accountability mechanisms, which mark the criticisms of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the UN GGE Report, are direct reflections of the status quo of the international system, which will be better addressed in the next section.",
    "## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute": "Parallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests.²⁹ However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt.³⁰ Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions.³¹ Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis.³² In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.³³\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”.³⁴ This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n²⁹ See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n³⁰ See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n³¹ See supra note 3.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system.³⁵ As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy,³⁶ accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China.³⁷ As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century.³⁸ From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization.³⁹ Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union.⁴⁰ The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively.⁴¹ In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.⁴²\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples.

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.⁴⁵\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century.⁴⁶ The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.⁴⁷\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.⁴⁸\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.⁴⁹\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n⁴⁴ See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n⁴⁵ See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n⁴⁶ See supra note 35.\n⁴⁷ See supra note 36.\n⁴⁸ Ibid.\n⁴⁹ See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n10\nchanges in its institutional structure. Therefore, in 2015, the Chinese Armed Forces created two new branches: the PLA Rocket Force, which is responsible for controlling China’s conventional and nuclear missiles, and the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (hereinafter referred to as PLASSF), which is responsible for space warfare, electronic warfare and cyber warfare. The PLASSF would, consequently, play the role of spearhead of the People’s Liberation Army with regard to the new battlefields of the 21st century,⁵⁰ materializing the Chinese commitment to developing its cyber capabilities, understanding them as important asymmetric weapons in the dispute for global power. Since the 1990s, China’s cyber warfare program has been developed and modernized so that Beijing can utilize cyber operations to achieve its long-term global goals,⁵¹ making China one of the world’s leading cyber powers.\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region.⁵² It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea.⁵³ Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades.⁵⁴ One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law.⁵⁵ Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n⁵⁰ See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² See Michael O.

In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)”⁵⁷ which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018.⁵⁸ Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.⁵⁹\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n⁵⁶ See supra note 22.\n⁵⁷ See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n⁵⁸ See K.

AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia.⁶¹ Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.",
    "## 4. Main Challenges for International Law": "The process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.⁶²\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n⁶⁰ See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n⁶¹ See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n⁶² See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.⁶³\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State.⁶⁴ Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior,⁶⁵ since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc.⁶⁶ Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty.⁶⁷ The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities.⁶⁸ These behaviors have a negative impact on\n⁶³ See supra note 26.\n⁶⁴ See supra note 13.\n⁶⁵ See supra note 2.\n⁶⁶ See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁶⁷ See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n⁶⁸ See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n14\ninternational cooperation, intensifying “the nuclear security dilemma, which accelerates the arms race, resulting in the end of stability-enhancing arms control”⁶⁹\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense,⁷⁰ meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace,⁷¹ which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.⁷²\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.⁷³\n⁶⁹ See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n⁷⁰ See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁷¹ See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n⁷² See supra note 14.\n⁷³ See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n15\nSince the crisis that led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia, Moscow has been systematically accused of conducting of gray zone operations in Ukrainian territory, in order to achieve its political objectives without starting a conventional conflict. This strategy was changed in 2022, when Russia decided to militarily invade Ukrainian territory.⁷⁴ In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO officially announced that cyberattacks on a member country of the organization would trigger Article 5⁷⁵ of its treaty.⁷⁶\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico.⁷⁷ Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war.⁷⁸ China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.⁷⁹\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.⁸⁰",
    "## 5. Conclusion": "The rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n⁷⁴ See supra note 52.\n⁷⁵ Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”.

Therefore, based on the elements addressed throughout this research, it was possible to draw some conclusions about the relationship between the status quo of the international system and the creation of a cyberspace regulation process.\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17"

In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement\n1. Introduction\nThe beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict\n Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.\ncritical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries. This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony, seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021. The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”. These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability. Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security. The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace. If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor. Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process. In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack. In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001.[20] Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years.[21] Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse.[22] The main criticism involving the publication of\n[16] See supra note 14.\n[17] See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[18] See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n[19] See supra note 14, at 76.\n[20] See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n[21] See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[22] The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict. Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”. Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n Ibid.\n See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests. However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt. Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions. Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis. In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”. This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n See supra note 3.\n Ibid.\n See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system. As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy, accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China. As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century. From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization. Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union. The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively. In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century. The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n See supra note 35.\n See supra note 36.\n Ibid.\n See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region. It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea. Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades. One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law. Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n Ibid.\n See Michael O.

In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)” which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018. Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n See supra note 22.\n See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n See K. Zeng &amp; R. Wells et al., Bilateral Tensions, the Trade War, and US-China Trade Relations, 24(4) Business and Politics 399, 399-429 (2022).\n See Jeff Pao, New US Chip Ban Takes Tech War to Dire Next Level, https://asiatimes.com/2022/10/new-us-chip-ban-takes-tech-war-to-dire-next-level/ (accessed on November 8, 2022).\n\nThe trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (hereinafter referred to as the AUKUS) was established in 2021 with the aim of increasing security and development cooperation between the three countries. AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia. Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law\nThe process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State. Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior, since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc. Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty. The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities. These behaviors have a negative impact on\n See supra note 26.\n See supra note 13.\n See supra note 2.\n See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense, meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace, which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.\n See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n See supra note 14.\n See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico. Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war. China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n See supra note 52.\n Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”. See NATO, The North Atlantic Treaty, p. 1 (1949).\n See James Pearson &amp; Jonathan Landay, *Cyberattack on NATO Could Trigger Collective Defence Clause—official*, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/ (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Heather Saul, *US Pushed to Explain Allegations of NSA Spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff*, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-pushed-to-explain-allegations-of-nsa-spying-on-brazilian-president-dilma-rousseff-8795711.html (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Andy Greenberg, *How Not To Prevent a Cyberwar With Russia*, https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cyberwar-escalation-power-grid/ (accessed on November 19, 2022).\n See supra note 12.\n See supra note 26.\n\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17",

In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement\n1. Introduction\nThe beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict\n Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.\ncritical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries. This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony, seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021. The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”. These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability. Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security. The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace. If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor. Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process. In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack. In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001.[20] Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years.[21] Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse.[22] The main criticism involving the publication of\n[16] See supra note 14.\n[17] See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[18] See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n[19] See supra note 14, at 76.\n[20] See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n[21] See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[22] The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict. Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”. Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n Ibid.\n See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests. However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt. Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions. Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis. In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”. This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n See supra note 3.\n Ibid.\n See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system. As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy, accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China. As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century. From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization. Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union. The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively. In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century. The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n See supra note 35.\n See supra note 36.\n Ibid.\n See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region. It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea. Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades. One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law. Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n Ibid.\n See Michael O.

In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)” which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018. Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n See supra note 22.\n See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n See K. Zeng &amp; R. Wells et al., Bilateral Tensions, the Trade War, and US-China Trade Relations, 24(4) Business and Politics 399, 399-429 (2022).\n See Jeff Pao, New US Chip Ban Takes Tech War to Dire Next Level, https://asiatimes.com/2022/10/new-us-chip-ban-takes-tech-war-to-dire-next-level/ (accessed on November 8, 2022).\n\nThe trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (hereinafter referred to as the AUKUS) was established in 2021 with the aim of increasing security and development cooperation between the three countries. AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia. Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law\nThe process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State. Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior, since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc. Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty. The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities. These behaviors have a negative impact on\n See supra note 26.\n See supra note 13.\n See supra note 2.\n See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense, meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace, which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.\n See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n See supra note 14.\n See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico. Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war. China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n See supra note 52.\n Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”. See NATO, The North Atlantic Treaty, p. 1 (1949).\n See James Pearson &amp; Jonathan Landay, *Cyberattack on NATO Could Trigger Collective Defence Clause—official*, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/ (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Heather Saul, *US Pushed to Explain Allegations of NSA Spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff*, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-pushed-to-explain-allegations-of-nsa-spying-on-brazilian-president-dilma-rousseff-8795711.html (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n See Andy Greenberg, *How Not To Prevent a Cyberwar With Russia*, https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cyberwar-escalation-power-grid/ (accessed on November 19, 2022).\n See supra note 12.\n See supra note 26.\n\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17"

In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement\n1. Introduction\nThe beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict\n¹ Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.\ncritical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries.² This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony,³ seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n² See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n³ See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021.⁴ The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”.⁵ These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.⁶\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability.⁷ Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security.⁸ The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace.⁹ If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n⁴ See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n⁵ See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n⁶ See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n⁷ See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n⁸ See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n⁹ See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.¹⁰\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor.¹¹ Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process.¹² In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.¹³\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack.¹⁴ In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.¹⁵\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n¹⁰ The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

[creating] potential to misread the intentions of other states that could unnecessarily lead to escalation\".16\nIn addition, the absence of a clear regulation of the limits of operations that can be conducted peacetime and wartime leads states to explore \"gray zones\" between these two stages. By definition, gray zone operations take advantage of loopholes and ambiguities in international law and principles. This strategy is present in all five strategic domains, but the fundamental characteristics of cyberspace - mentioned above - enhance its use.\nWhen it comes to combating cybercrime, it is possible to notice a clear effort of international cooperation and the creation of norms and institutions. One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001. Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years. Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse. The main criticism involving the publication of\n See supra note 14.\n See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n See supra note 14, at 76.\n See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n5\nthe manual was the low variety of the group of approximately twenty specialists responsible for the work - which was mainly composed by American, Canadian and Western European experts.\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict.²³ Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”.²⁴ Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.²⁵\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.²⁶\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n²³ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n²⁴ See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n27 See United Nations, Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/RES/73/266, p. 6 (2021).\n28 See Paul Meyer, Incremental Progress or Circular Motion? – The UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) Report 2021, https://ict4peace.org/activities/ict4peace-commentary-on-final-un-gge-2021-report/ (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n7\nof an institution capable of regulating cyber operations, but as noted, they are still very incipient. It is argued here that the difficulty in creating an institution with international credibility to regulate cyberspace, as well as the lack of consensus and the creation of accountability mechanisms, which mark the criticisms of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the UN GGE Report, are direct reflections of the status quo of the international system, which will be better addressed in the next section.\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests.²⁹ However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt.³⁰ Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions.³¹ Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis.³² In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.³³\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”.³⁴ This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n²⁹ See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n³⁰ See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n³¹ See supra note 3.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system.³⁵ As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy,³⁶ accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China.³⁷ As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century.³⁸ From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization.³⁹ Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union.⁴⁰ The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively.⁴¹ In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.⁴²\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.⁴³ In\n³⁵ See Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *Caos Sistêmico: A Crise da Hegemonia Norte-Americana e a Ascensão da China*, Unpublished Bachelor’s Thesis, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, p. 87 (2021).\n³⁶ See Oliver Stuenkel, *O mundo pós-Ocidental: Potências Emergentes e a Nova Ordem Global*, Zahar, p. 118 (2018).\n³⁷ See Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.⁴⁵\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century.⁴⁶ The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.⁴⁷\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.⁴⁸\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.⁴⁹\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n⁴⁴ See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n⁴⁵ See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n⁴⁶ See supra note 35.\n⁴⁷ See supra note 36.\n⁴⁸ Ibid.\n⁴⁹ See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n10\nchanges in its institutional structure. Therefore, in 2015, the Chinese Armed Forces created two new branches: the PLA Rocket Force, which is responsible for controlling China’s conventional and nuclear missiles, and the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (hereinafter referred to as PLASSF), which is responsible for space warfare, electronic warfare and cyber warfare. The PLASSF would, consequently, play the role of spearhead of the People’s Liberation Army with regard to the new battlefields of the 21st century,⁵⁰ materializing the Chinese commitment to developing its cyber capabilities, understanding them as important asymmetric weapons in the dispute for global power. Since the 1990s, China’s cyber warfare program has been developed and modernized so that Beijing can utilize cyber operations to achieve its long-term global goals,⁵¹ making China one of the world’s leading cyber powers.\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region.⁵² It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea.⁵³ Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades.⁵⁴ One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law.⁵⁵ Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n⁵⁰ See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² See Michael O.

In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)”⁵⁷ which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018.⁵⁸ Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.⁵⁹\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n⁵⁶ See supra note 22.\n⁵⁷ See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n⁵⁸ See K.

AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia.⁶¹ Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law\nThe process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.⁶²\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n⁶⁰ See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n⁶¹ See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n⁶² See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.⁶³\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State.⁶⁴ Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior,⁶⁵ since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc.⁶⁶ Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty.⁶⁷ The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities.⁶⁸ These behaviors have a negative impact on\n⁶³ See supra note 26.\n⁶⁴ See supra note 13.\n⁶⁵ See supra note 2.\n⁶⁶ See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁶⁷ See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n⁶⁸ See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n14\ninternational cooperation, intensifying “the nuclear security dilemma, which accelerates the arms race, resulting in the end of stability-enhancing arms control”⁶⁹\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense,⁷⁰ meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace,⁷¹ which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.⁷²\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.⁷³\n⁶⁹ See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n⁷⁰ See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁷¹ See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n⁷² See supra note 14.\n⁷³ See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n15\nSince the crisis that led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia, Moscow has been systematically accused of conducting of gray zone operations in Ukrainian territory, in order to achieve its political objectives without starting a conventional conflict. This strategy was changed in 2022, when Russia decided to militarily invade Ukrainian territory.⁷⁴ In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO officially announced that cyberattacks on a member country of the organization would trigger Article 5⁷⁵ of its treaty.⁷⁶\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico.⁷⁷ Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war.⁷⁸ China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.⁷⁹\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.⁸⁰\n## 5. Conclusion\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n⁷⁴ See supra note 52.\n⁷⁵ Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”.

Therefore, based on the elements addressed throughout this research, it was possible to draw some conclusions about the relationship between the status quo of the international system and the creation of a cyberspace regulation process.\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17"

In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement The beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict ¹ Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.\ncritical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries.² This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony,³ seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation In the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications ² See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n³ See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021.⁴ The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”.⁵ These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.⁶ When dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability.⁷ Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security.⁸ The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace.⁹ If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also ⁴ See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n⁵ See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n⁶ See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n⁷ See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n⁸ See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n⁹ See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.¹⁰ The concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor.¹¹ Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process.¹² In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.¹³ Defining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack.¹⁴ In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.¹⁵ Finally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the ¹⁰ The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001.[20] Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years.[21] Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse.[22] The main criticism involving the publication of [16] See supra note 14.\n[17] See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[18] See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n[19] See supra note 14, at 76.\n[20] See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n[21] See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n[22] The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz, Taking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict.²³ Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”.²⁴ Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.²⁵ Although there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.²⁶ Since 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats, How China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n²³ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n²⁴ See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28 Despite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests.²⁹ However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt.³⁰ Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions.³¹ Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis.³² In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.³³\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”.³⁴ This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n²⁹ See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n³⁰ See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n³¹ See supra note 3.\n³² Ibid.\n³³ See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system.³⁵ As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy,³⁶ accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China.³⁷ As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century.³⁸ From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization.³⁹ Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union.⁴⁰ The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively.⁴¹ In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.⁴²\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.⁴³ In\n³⁵ See Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *Caos Sistêmico: A Crise da Hegemonia Norte-Americana e a Ascensão da China*, Unpublished Bachelor’s Thesis, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, p. 87 (2021).\n³⁶ See Oliver Stuenkel, *O mundo pós-Ocidental: Potências Emergentes e a Nova Ordem Global*, Zahar, p. 118 (2018).\n³⁷ See Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.⁴⁵ The AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century.⁴⁶ The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.⁴⁷ Finally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.⁴⁸ Seeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.⁴⁹ Modernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also ⁴⁴ See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n⁴⁵ See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n⁴⁶ See supra note 35.\n⁴⁷ See supra note 36.\n⁴⁸ Ibid.\n⁴⁹ See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region.⁵² It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea.⁵³ Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades.⁵⁴ One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law.⁵⁵ Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in ⁵⁰ See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n⁵² See Michael O. Slobodchikoff, *Challenging US Hegemony: The Ukrainian Crisis and Russian Regional Order*, 44(1) The Soviet and Post-Soviet Review 76, 76-95 (2017).\n⁵³ See Borys Kormych &amp; Tetyana Malyarenko, *From Gray Zone to Conventional Warfare: The Russia-Ukraine Conflict in the Black Sea*, Small Wars &amp; Insurgencies 1, 1-36 (2022).\n⁵⁴ See Steven Rosefielde, *Russia in the 21st Century: The Prodigal Superpower*, Cambridge University Press, p. 9 (2004).\n⁵⁵ See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n\nRelations between Russia and China in recent years have suggested the formation of a strategic partnership between the two countries. In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)”⁵⁷ which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018.⁵⁸ Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.⁵⁹ In the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether ⁵⁶ See supra note 22.\n⁵⁷ See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n⁵⁸ See K. Zeng &amp; R. Wells et al., Bilateral Tensions, the Trade War, and US-China Trade Relations, 24(4) Business and Politics 399, 399-429 (2022).\n⁵⁹ See Jeff Pao, New US Chip Ban Takes Tech War to Dire Next Level, https://asiatimes.com/2022/10/new-us-chip-ban-takes-tech-war-to-dire-next-level/ (accessed on November 8, 2022).\n\nThe trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (hereinafter referred to as the AUKUS) was established in 2021 with the aim of increasing security and development cooperation between the three countries. AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia.⁶¹ Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law The process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.⁶² As discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their ⁶⁰ See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n⁶¹ See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n⁶² See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).\nterritories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.⁶³ The attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State.⁶⁴ Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior,⁶⁵ since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc.⁶⁶ Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty.⁶⁷ The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities.⁶⁸ These behaviors have a negative impact on ⁶³ See supra note 26.\n⁶⁴ See supra note 13.\n⁶⁵ See supra note 2.\n⁶⁶ See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁶⁷ See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n⁶⁸ See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense,⁷⁰ meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace,⁷¹ which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.⁷² The Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.⁷³ ⁶⁹ See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n⁷⁰ See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁷¹ See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n⁷² See supra note 14.\n⁷³ See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico.⁷⁷ Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war.⁷⁸ China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.⁷⁹ When conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.⁸⁰ ## 5. Conclusion The rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber ⁷⁴ See supra note 52.\n⁷⁵ Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”. See NATO, The North Atlantic Treaty, p. 1 (1949).\n⁷⁶ See James Pearson &amp; Jonathan Landay, *Cyberattack on NATO Could Trigger Collective Defence Clause—official*, https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/ (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁷⁷ See Heather Saul, *US Pushed to Explain Allegations of NSA Spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff*, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-pushed-to-explain-allegations-of-nsa-spying-on-brazilian-president-dilma-rousseff-8795711.html (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n⁷⁸ See Andy Greenberg, *How Not To Prevent a Cyberwar With Russia*, https://www.wired.com/story/russia-cyberwar-escalation-power-grid/ (accessed on November 19, 2022).\n⁷⁹ See supra note 12.\n⁸⁰ See supra note 26.\n\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17"

  "payload": "## ## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\n\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n² See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n³ See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).\nservices - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021.⁴ The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”.⁵ These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.⁶\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability.⁷ Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security.⁸ The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace.⁹ If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n⁴ See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n⁵ See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n⁶ See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n⁷ See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n⁸ See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n⁹ See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).\ncalled the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.¹⁰\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor.¹¹ Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process.¹² In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.¹³\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack.¹⁴ In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.¹⁵\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n¹⁰ The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

[creating] potential to misread the intentions of other states that could unnecessarily lead to escalation\".16\nIn addition, the absence of a clear regulation of the limits of operations that can be conducted peacetime and wartime leads states to explore \"gray zones\" between these two stages. By definition, gray zone operations take advantage of loopholes and ambiguities in international law and principles. This strategy is present in all five strategic domains, but the fundamental characteristics of cyberspace - mentioned above - enhance its use.\nWhen it comes to combating cybercrime, it is possible to notice a clear effort of international cooperation and the creation of norms and institutions. One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001. Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years. Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse. The main criticism involving the publication of\n See supra note 14.\n See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n See supra note 14, at 76.\n See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n5\nthe manual was the low variety of the group of approximately twenty specialists responsible for the work - which was mainly composed by American, Canadian and Western European experts.\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict.²³ Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”.²⁴ Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.²⁵\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.²⁶\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n²³ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n²⁴ See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf? Tallinn Manual 2.0 on Cyberoperations and Subsequent State Practice, 112(4) American Journal of International Law 583, 589-589 (2018).\n²⁵ Ibid.\n²⁶ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 &amp; Gray Zones in International Law – CyCon 2017, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w38HSUlnX6U (accessed on November 3, 2022).\nnorms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n27 See United Nations, Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/RES/73/266, p. 6 (2021).\n28 See Paul Meyer, Incremental Progress or Circular Motion? – The UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) Report 2021, https://ict4peace.org/activities/ict4peace-commentary-on-final-un-gge-2021-report/ (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n7\nof an institution capable of regulating cyber operations, but as noted, they are still very incipient. It is argued here that the difficulty in creating an institution with international credibility to regulate cyberspace, as well as the lack of consensus and the creation of accountability mechanisms, which mark the criticisms of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the UN GGE Report, are direct reflections of the status quo of the international system, which will be better addressed in the next section.\n\n---\n\n## ## 5. Conclusion\n\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n⁷⁴ See supra note 52.\n⁷⁵ Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”.

Therefore, based on the elements addressed throughout this research, it was possible to draw some conclusions about the relationship between the status quo of the international system and the creation of a cyberspace regulation process.\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n17",

    "The Challenges of Cyberspace Regulation in View of the Global Power Dispute\n\nRodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro¹\n\nAbstract: Information technologies, as well as cyberspace, have assumed a central role in contemporary society, becoming essential for the functioning of the economic, political and social sectors of states and even their Armed Forces. In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.\n\nKey words: Cyberspace Regulation; Global Power; Dispute Settlement\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe beginning of the 21st century simultaneously observed two important events for the global balance of power. The first one is related to the rise of information and communication technologies, which ended up becoming fundamental for the functioning of critical structures of the states. The second change is related to the status quo of the international system, characterized by a hegemonic crisis.\n\nUnderstood by the great powers as a new strategic domain, cyberspace has taken on a central role in the contemporary warfare strategy, as it has made it possible to inflict\n\n¹ Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, Master Candidate in Strategic Studies of Defense and Security, Research Assistant at the Center for Studies on Contemporary China and Asia, Universidade Federal Fluminense.",
    "critical damage on an adversary without the use of kinetic means. The cyber domain is capable of influencing all other strategic domains simultaneously. In addition, it has characteristics such as the difficulty of attribution and the absence of an institutional framework capable of regulating it, despite some incipient initiatives. Without regulation on cyber operations, the recent years witnessed several examples of cyber espionage operations, denial of service and even sabotage of critical infrastructures, often conducted in peacetime.\n\nAt the same time, the international system has been showing the characteristics of what Giovanni Arrighi defines as “systemic chaos”, that is, a conflict between two or more sets of norms and behaviors represented by different countries.² This apparently irremediable situation is caused by the crisis of American hegemony, evidenced over the last decade. In view of the 2008 financial crisis and the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its primary objectives in its campaigns in the Middle East, China and Russia have started to directly challenge the pillars of American hegemony,³ seeking to increase their international influence and modernize their Armed forces. The United States, in turn, is trying to maintain its hegemonic status, opting for a more aggressive foreign policy, based on the formation of new military alliances and intensifying its relations with its allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThis article seeks to understand the impact of the global power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The central argument raised is that the systemic chaos generated by the crisis of American hegemony hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility, due to the clash of interests between the world’s major military and cyber powers. The main conclusion drawn is that the systemic chaos prevents the formation of a consensus that hinders not only the formation of an institution capable of regulate cyberspace, but also the very applicability of such regulation.\n\nThis research is inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative, using data collected by the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and databases, divided into three sections. In the first section, the aim is to outline an overview of the main characteristics of cyberspace and the problems associated with the regulation of this domain. In the second section, the status quo of the international system is discussed as a systemic chaos and the strategic interests that shape the behavior of the main military powers of the globe. Finally, in the third section, the main challenges for the regulation of cyberspace are raised in light of the discussion about the global power dispute.\n\n## 2. Cyber Domain Regulation\n\nIn the 21st century, Information and Communication Technologies (hereinafter referred to as ICTs) gradually assumed a central role in contemporary societies, becoming, in some cases, essential for the functioning of a State. For 2022, a global investment of the United States $ 4.5 trillion is estimated in the ICTs sector - which includes data storage systems, software, devices and technology and communications\n\n² See Giovanni Arrighi, *The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times*, Verso, p. 31 (2010).\n\n³ See Robert Cox, *Gramsci, Hegemony and International Relations: An Essay in Method*, 12(2) Millennium 162, 162-175 (1983).",
    "services - representing an increase of 5.1% compared to 2021.⁴ The large investments in the sector translate into a rapid increase in the capillarity of ICTs within states, making their critical infrastructures increasingly dependent on the use of information and communication technologies for their functioning.\n\nThe critical infrastructures of a State are all those “responsible for providing certain commodities or services that are essential for the economic prosperity and social vitality of a Society”.⁵ These infrastructures are generally divided into categories according to their main function, as is the case of the taxonomy presented by Sergio Castro. The author separates the critical infrastructure of a State into eight categories, namely: “Government, Electricity grid; Oil and gas production and distribution; Logistic networks; Telecommunications; Financial sector; Manufacturing sector; [and] Services”.⁶\n\nWhen dealing with the impact of ICTs on critical infrastructure, it is first necessary to establish two principles. First, if a system or a device is connected to a network, it may be exposed to a cyber-attack that exploits a vulnerability that is either unknown or has yet to be patched. Second, the level of connectivity is directly proportional to the level of vulnerability.⁷ Taking these factors into account, increasing investments in ICTs, in addition to improving the effectiveness of the systems used by the critical infrastructures of the states, increases their susceptibility to cyberattacks carried out by private and state actors with economic, military or political objectives. Therefore, it becomes possible to cause critical damage to a State from cyberspace, without the use of kinetic weapons.\n\nCritical damage can be inflicted on a state through cyberspace when the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system, a device, or even a file is attacked. Thus, confidentiality, integrity and availability are classified as fundamental principles of information security.⁸ The concept of cyber operations arises from this discussion, being defined as the use of cyber capabilities aiming to achieve objectives in or from cyberspace.⁹ If this operation attacks the cybersecurity principles mentioned above, it can be defined as a cyberattack. On the other hand, if the operation aims to protect availability, reliability or availability, it is a cyber defense operation.\n\nFrom this perspective, it is essential to emphasize that the great military powers of the world - such as China, the United States and Russia - have a high degree of ICTs’ capillarity. Thus, due to its fundamental role in contemporary warfare, cyberspace is already understood by these countries as a new strategic domain. The cyber domain, also\n\n⁴ See Meghan Rimol, *Gartner Forecasts Worldwide IT Spending to Grow 5.1% in 2022*, https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-18-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-five-point-1-percent-in-2022 (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n\n⁵ See Nan Li &amp; Fei Wang et al., *Interdependent Effects of Critical Infrastructure Systems under Different Types of Disruptions*, 8(1) International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction 1, 1 (2022).\n\n⁶ See Sergio Castro, *Towards the Development of a Rationalist Cyber Conflict Theory*, 6(1) The Cyber Defense Review 35, 40 (2021).\n\n⁷ See Vitória Giordano &amp; João Paulo Bosso, *A Estruturação da Defesa e Segurança Cibernética a partir do Mapeamento Documental dos Estados Unidos da América*, Danielle Jacon Ayres Pinto, Graciela de Conti Pagliari, Jéssica Maria Grassi (eds), *A Geopolítica das Estratégias em Defesa Cibernética*, Alpheratz, p. 17 (2021).\n\n⁸ See Peter Singer &amp; Allan Friedman, *Cybersecurity and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs to Know*, Oxford University Press, p. 35 (2014).\n\n⁹ See United States of America, *Joint Publication 3-12: Cyberspace Operations*, p. v (2013).",
    "called the Fifth Domain, has no geographic limitations and can simultaneously affect all other strategic domains.¹⁰\n\nThe concept of cyberspace is volatile, being defined in different ways by states, international organizations and scholars. However, it is possible to raise three essential characteristics of cyberspace that end up shaping the behavior of states in this domain: the difficulty of attribution, the vague definition of threats and the lack of international regulation.\n\nAttributing a cyberattack to its respective actors is a major challenge in cyberspace. When an actor, whether state or private, conducts a cyberattack against a certain target, they are able to mask the origin of the attack, making it incredibly difficult to say with certainty that the attack came from this actor.¹¹ Also, when launching cyberattacks, it is common for states to take advantage of a “bad reputation” of certain countries and mask them as coming from the territories of these actors. In a practical example, other states take advantage of the many cyber espionage operations attributed to China to camouflage their attacks as coming from Chinese territory, causing confusion in the attribution process.¹² In some cases, even when it is possible to trace the true origin of the attack, the obstacle becomes proving the link between the State and the group responsible for the attack, whether through direct command, funding or even providing sanctuary for the group’s actions. Therefore, it is evident that there is no international institution capable of conducting an attribution process with international credibility. Thus, in the absence of a standardized and internationally recognized forensic process, states opt for decentralized investigations that end up garnering a low reputation and credibility.¹³\n\nDefining and measuring threats is another challenge in cyberspace. The rapid advancement of technologies makes it difficult to raise awareness and measure the threats represented by a cyber-attack.¹⁴ In addition, when a company (or a State) becomes aware of a vulnerability in its systems, an actor will no longer be able to use this same “exploit” to carry out a future attack, since it is presumed that this security flaw will be patched. For this reason, most cyberattacks recorded so far are based on unsophisticated tools, since states tend to save their so-called “zero-day exploits” - complex cyber weapons that exploit vulnerabilities that are not yet known by their targets - for an eventual large-scale conflict.¹⁵\n\nFinally, cyberspace is also marked by a lack of international regulation of cyber operations conducted or sponsored by nation states. That is, just as there is no institution with international credibility to attribute cyberattacks to their original actors, there is also no institutional framework capable of regulating what types of cyber operations are permitted under international law. Therefore, a scenario is created “where details of the\n\n¹⁰ The other strategic domains are land, air, sea and space.

    "international legal principles and rules are poorly defined and subject to competing interpretation or contested application ... [creating] potential to misread the intentions of other states that could unnecessarily lead to escalation\".16\n\nIn addition, the absence of a clear regulation of the limits of operations that can be conducted peacetime and wartime leads states to explore \"gray zones\" between these two stages.[17] By definition, gray zone operations take advantage of loopholes and ambiguities in international law and principles.[18] This strategy is present in all five strategic domains, but the fundamental characteristics of cyberspace - mentioned above - enhance its use.[19]\n\nWhen it comes to combating cybercrime, it is possible to notice a clear effort of international cooperation and the creation of norms and institutions. One of the main achievements of this long-standing commitment is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, from the European Council, signed in 2001.[20] Currently, 67 countries, from all continents, have ratified the treaty that provides important definitions on different cybercrimes and encourages the cooperation between the parties to combat transgressions. In addition to the Budapest Convention, there are also bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat and cooperate on issues related to cybercrime, such as the Shanghai Declaration, promoted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC for short) in 2002, and the Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative, created in 2011. Even the United Nations, which already organizes the Internet Governance Forum since 2006, initiated meetings for the development of an international treaty on cybercrime, which should be finished in the coming years.[21] Therefore, even with some challenges, there is an international effort for cooperation and institutionalization regarding the fight against cybercrimes.\n\nThe same international effort to fight cybercrime through the creation of treaties and fostering international cooperation is not found in the context of cyber operations conducted, financed or supported by states. There is currently no Treaty or Convention regulating this practice. The most recent documents that come somewhat close to this goal are the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, published in 2017, and the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (hereinafter referred to as UN GGE) report published in 2021.\n\nPublished in 2013, the first Tallinn Manual was organized by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence in response to a series of cyberattacks launched against Estonia in 2007, which left the country's critical infrastructure on the brink of collapse.[22] The main criticism involving the publication of\n\n[16] See supra note 14.\n\n[17] See Ye Zheng, *On the Essential Characteristics, Power Composition and Content Form of Strategic Game in Cyberspace*, http://theory.people.com.cn/n/2014/0818/c40531-25487795.html (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n\n[18] See Michael Schmitt, *Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace*, 42(2) Yale Journal of International Law Online 1, 1-21 (2017).\n\n[19] See supra note 14, at 76.\n\n[20] See The Budapest Convention (ETS No. 185) and its Protocols, https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/the-budapest-convention%3Fref%3Dhackernoon.com (accessed on November 2, 2022).\n\n[21] See United Nations, *A UN Treaty on Cybercrime en route*, https://unric.org/en/a-un-treaty-on-cybercrime-en-route/ (accessed on November 1, 2022).\n\n[22] The attacks, which lasted about a month, took place in the context of a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Estonia and were attributed to Russia. However, it was not possible to prove that the attacks were carried out by the Russian government, which attributed the attacks to Russian patriots. See Jason Fritz,\n\n5",
    "the manual was the low variety of the group of approximately twenty specialists responsible for the work - which was mainly composed by American, Canadian and Western European experts.\n\nTaking this and other criticisms into account, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (hereinafter referred to as NATO) commissioned a second edition of the publication, the Tallinn Manual 2.0, which featured a more diverse team of experts, consultants and reviewers and offered a more in-depth approach when compared to its predecessor. The second version of the Manual outlines over 150 rules of conduct in cyberspace that deal with general characteristics of cyber law, its impact on other branches of international law - such as humanitarian law, maritime law and space law international cyber activities in peacetime and wartime and cybernetic conflict.²³ Comprising nearly 600 pages, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 constitutes a unique effort to build the debate on the applicability of international law to the cyber domain, however the publication was met with a series of criticisms from international scholars and policymakers.\n\nWhen addressing criticisms on the Tallinn Manual 2.0, two main points need to be made. First, it must be considered that the book was funded, organized and prepared by NATO. Furthermore, the Manual is classified as an academic production, and not as a document, or a treaty, therefore not containing any regulatory character. In addition to that, Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany point out that the publication does not make it clear “whether it is reflective of existing international law, or merely the articulation of the views of an international group of experts on how international law should be applied to cyber operations (including, at times, both consensus and dissension views)”.²⁴ Still according to the authors, critics questioned the low attention given by experts to issues related to international humanitarian law and even the application of international law as the most appropriate tool for the governance of cyberspace.²⁵\n\nAlthough there was an attempt to diversify the team of specialists involved in the production of the Tallinn Manual 2.0, it is imperative to highlight that experts from countries with robust cyber capabilities such as Russia, North Korea and Iran were not included in the discussions that originated the publication. Even without including representatives from these countries - who hold notably different sets of values from those cultivated by the West -, the experts responsible for the manual had difficulties in reaching a consensus on certain issues, which was marked as a reason for the number of pages of the work.²⁶\n\nSince 2004, the United Nations (hereinafter referred to as the UN) has been establishing a Group of Governmental Experts to deal with the behavior of states in cyberspace and its consequences for international security, producing six reports on the subject so far. The last report, released in 2021, was based on four formal meetings held between representatives of 25 countries, focusing on “existing and emerging threats,\n\nHow China Will Use Cyber Warfare to Leapfrog in Military Competitiveness, 8(1) Culture Mandala 30, 57-61 (2008).\n\n²³ See Michael Schmitt, Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press (2017).\n\n²⁴ See Dan Efrony &amp; Yuval Shany, A Rule Book on the Shelf?

    "norms, rules and principles of responsible State behaviour, international law, confidence-building and international cooperation and capacity-building, which together represent a cumulative and evolving framework for the responsible behavior of states in their use of ICTs”.27 By focusing on issues such as cooperation and transparency, the report highlights the importance of these practices to combat the unpredictability of threats that surround cyberspace and provide better conditions for states to develop their information security capabilities.\n\nThe main criticisms involving the 2021 Report point to the fact that the document doesn’t propose any guidelines (beyond dialogue and consultations) on how states should improve their cooperation on information security issues. On the same note, the document does not propose any type of accountability mechanism for states that do not act transparently or continue to conduct, fund, or provide sanctuary for organizations that engage in cyber operations that could cause critical damages to another State. Finally, the document was also criticized for not meeting the expectations raised about its publication, by not introducing new variables to the debate or presenting different solutions to problems already known in the field of information security, implying a lack of real progress and a cyclical discussion.28\n\nDespite the criticisms raised above, this paper argues that both the creation of new legislation to combat cybercrime, and the documents analyzed above, contribute, in their own way, to the creation of an institution that, in the future, may be able to regulate the cyberspace. First, the regulation of cybercrime helps to normalize a culture where principles of law are also applicable to the conduct of individuals in cyberspace, moving away from the idea of the internet as a “no man’s land”. The Tallinn Manuals, in turn, address how basic principles of international law apply to cyber operations. By dealing with key principles of international law (such as the principle of sovereignty, humanitarian law and international cooperation), based on widely adhered to International Conventions, the Manuals offer a guideline, although incipient, for a future regulation of cyberspace. Furthermore, the UN GGE 2021 Report, by also being built on the principles of international law, offers a more robust institutional support for these principles to also be considered in the context of the laws applicable to cyberspace. In this sense, despite the criticisms and challenges, the efforts mentioned above represent important contributions to the design of a future institution capable of exercising governance over cyberspace.\n\nThus, due to the advance of ICTs in the 21st century, the cyber domain appears as a new variable with a great impact on issues related to the security of states, presenting risks and challenges hitherto unheard of, such as the possibility of inflicting critical damage on an enemy without the use of kinetic means. Intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace, such as the difficulty in assigning and unpredictability of threats and the absence of an international regulation of cybernetic operations conducted, financed or supported by states, differentiate it from other strategic domains. The two Tallinn Manuals and the 2021 UN GGE Report comprise the main contributions to the formation\n\n27 See United Nations, Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security, A/RES/73/266, p. 6 (2021).\n\n28 See Paul Meyer, Incremental Progress or Circular Motion? – The UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) Report 2021, https://ict4peace.org/activities/ict4peace-commentary-on-final-un-gge-2021-report/ (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n\n7",
    "of an institution capable of regulating cyber operations, but as noted, they are still very incipient. It is argued here that the difficulty in creating an institution with international credibility to regulate cyberspace, as well as the lack of consensus and the creation of accountability mechanisms, which mark the criticisms of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the UN GGE Report, are direct reflections of the status quo of the international system, which will be better addressed in the next section.\n\n## 3. The Ongoing Global Power Dispute\n\nParallel to the scenario explored in the previous section, in which the rise of information and communication technologies in the 21st century creates new risks and challenges for the security of states, creating a new strategic domain, the international system is also facing a period of profound changes. During the 1990s, the United States of America enjoyed an unprecedented hegemony in human history, being able to impose its political, military and economic interests and creating a world order totally centered on its own strategic interests.²⁹ However, as of 2001, American hegemony began to show gradual signs of wear and tear, being questioned in recent years by other countries, notably China and Russia.\n\nWithin the studies on hegemony, the work of Antonio Gramsci appears as one of the most influential. Writing in the context of the relations between social groups within the State, the author defines that hegemony occurs when a group propagates its own values and norms to a population that ends up understanding those values as common good, adopting them without objection or revolt.³⁰ Writing about Gramsci’s work, Robert Cox transports the concept of hegemony to the field of International Relations, arguing that in the international system, hegemony is exercised through the creation of norms and institutions.³¹ Also, according to Cox, to characterize a hegemony, the dominant relationship must be expressed simultaneously in the economic, political and social fields. Questioning any of these pillars would constitute a hegemonic crisis.³² In this sense, authors such as Giovanni Arrighi and Kishore Mahbubani argue that the American hegemony is experiencing a moment of crisis and decline.³³\n\nIn this sense, Arrighi argues that the crisis of American hegemony causes the international system to assume a status of systemic chaos, that is, a “situation of total and apparently irremediable lack of organization … [caused when] a new set of rules and norms of behavior is imposed on an older set of rules and norms without displacing it”.³⁴ This article is based on Arrighi’s definition of systemic chaos to characterize the effects of the American hegemonic crisis over the international system.\n\nFrom the 21st century onwards, at least two of the three pillars of American hegemony began to be questioned. Addressing the political pillar first, the failure to secure the United States strategic objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, within the context of the War on Terror, raised doubts about the capabilities of the United\n\n²⁹ See Salvador Regilme Jr. &amp; James Parisot, *American Hegemony and the Rise of Emerging Powers Cooperation or Conflict*, Routledge, p. 6 (2017).\n\n³⁰ See Antonio Gramsci, *Prison Notebooks (volume 2)*, Columbia University Press, pp. 181-183 (1996).\n\n³¹ See supra note 3.\n\n³² Ibid.\n\n³³ See Giovanni Arrighi, *Adam Smith in Beijing: Lineages of the 21st Century*, Verso, p. 178 (2007); Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

    "States military power. In addition, such interventions came to be considered as imperialist policies by some actors in the international system.³⁵ As for the economic pillar, the 2008 financial crisis undermined the credibility of the American economy,³⁶ accelerating the process of shifting the world economic axis to Asia, pivoted by the economic rise of China.³⁷ As a result, from Gramsci’s and Cox’s point of view, the American hegemony is no longer sustainable. The questioning of these pillars marks a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior led respectively by the United States, Russia and China.\n\nDue to its high economic growth in recent decades, China sought to increase its influence over the international system. Thus, Beijing initially strived to expand its role in institutions created and historically led by the United States, such as the World Trade Organization (hereinafter referred to as WTO), the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (hereinafter referred to as IMF) and the World Bank.\n\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 as a developing country represented one of the most important events in the international economy in the 21st century.³⁸ From this event, the growth of the Chinese economy was driven by the privileges gained by the country as a developing country within the organization.³⁹ Currently, China is one of the most active actors in the organization, along with the United States and the European Union.⁴⁰ The same trend of expansion of the Chinese influence is also repeated at the IMF and the World Bank. China is the third largest contributor in both institutions, which translates, within their internal logic, to the third largest voting power, surpassed by the United States and Japan, respectively.⁴¹ In the case of the IMF, there were internal negotiations for changes that would allow China to become the second largest contributor, however, in 2019, pressure from the United States culminated in the postponement of the process.⁴²\n\nAs one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (hereinafter referred to as UNSC), China has sought in recent years to increase its influence over other organizations within the UN system. The World Health Organization (hereinafter referred to as WHO) and the Department of Peace Operations (hereinafter referred to as DPKO) are among the main examples. Since 2014, China has increased its investment in the WHO by 50%, seeking to boost its influence over the organization.⁴³ In\n\n³⁵ See Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *Caos Sistêmico: A Crise da Hegemonia Norte-Americana e a Ascensão da China*, Unpublished Bachelor’s Thesis, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, p. 87 (2021).\n\n³⁶ See Oliver Stuenkel, *O mundo pós-Ocidental: Potências Emergentes e a Nova Ordem Global*, Zahar, p. 118 (2018).\n\n³⁷ See Kishore Mahbubani, *Has the West Lost it?

    "the case of the DPKO, in addition to substantially increasing its investment in the organization, becoming the department’s second largest financial contributor, China is the only permanent member of the UNSC to contribute with troops, which are concentrated in strategically important areas for the country considering its economic objectives.⁴⁴\n\nWhile seeking room in the United States-led institutions, China is also building its own institutional framework. In this sense, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (hereinafter referred to as SCO), the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (hereinafter referred to as AIIB) and the Belt and Road Initiative appear as the main examples of this movement.\n\nFounded in 1996, the SCO has eight members including China, Russia, India and Pakistan. The main objective of the SCO is to foster economic, cultural and security cooperation. It should be noted that the organization does not constitute a military alliance, since its collective security treaty aims only to increase cooperation between members in combating separatism, extremism and transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking.⁴⁵\n\nThe AIIB is one of the greatest examples of the shift in the global economic axis to Asia in the 21st century.⁴⁶ The creation of the bank represented a direct challenge to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is historically chaired by Japan, seeking to meet a demand for financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries. Since its founding in 2014, the success attributed to the AIIB have helped increasing the credibility of the Chinese economy, which undermined the efforts undertaken by the United States to prevent its closest allies from joining the bank.⁴⁷\n\nFinally, the Belt and Road Initiative, announced in 2013 by President Jinping Xi, represents the largest infrastructure project in human history, aimed at integrating China with its main economic partners through the construction of highways, railways, ports and airports. The project seeks to expand China’s influence over Central Asia by strengthening institutional and economic ties between countries in the region and Beijing.⁴⁸\n\nSeeking to protect its strategic interests, in recent years China has been substantially modernizing its Armed Forces. The People’s Liberation Army (hereinafter referred to as PLA) emerged from an archaic force, with low organizational capacity and readiness, in 2000, and began to surpass, as of 2020, Armed Forces of the United States in some aspects - such as a total number of ships, anti-aircraft defense systems, and a ballistic and cruise missile program.⁴⁹\n\nModernization of the PLA gained prominence especially after the rise of Jinping Xi to the presidency in 2013. Under Xi’s administration, the modernization began to include not only the development of new weapons and material capabilities of the PLA, but also\n\n⁴⁴ See Maria Parracho &amp; Rodrigo Abreu de Barcellos Ribeiro, *O Papel Chinês nas Operações de Paz da ONU*, 171(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2022).\n\n⁴⁵ See Eleanor Albert, *The Shanghai Cooperation Organization*, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/shanghai-cooperation-organization (accessed on November 6, 2022).\n\n⁴⁶ See supra note 35.\n\n⁴⁷ See supra note 36.\n\n⁴⁸ Ibid.\n\n⁴⁹ See United States Office of the Secretary of Defense, *Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2020: Annual Report to Congress*, pp. i-ii (2020).\n\n10",
    "changes in its institutional structure. Therefore, in 2015, the Chinese Armed Forces created two new branches: the PLA Rocket Force, which is responsible for controlling China’s conventional and nuclear missiles, and the People’s Liberation Army Strategic Support Force (hereinafter referred to as PLASSF), which is responsible for space warfare, electronic warfare and cyber warfare. The PLASSF would, consequently, play the role of spearhead of the People’s Liberation Army with regard to the new battlefields of the 21st century,⁵⁰ materializing the Chinese commitment to developing its cyber capabilities, understanding them as important asymmetric weapons in the dispute for global power. Since the 1990s, China’s cyber warfare program has been developed and modernized so that Beijing can utilize cyber operations to achieve its long-term global goals,⁵¹ making China one of the world’s leading cyber powers.\n\nHence, the PLA modernization process undertaken by China in recent years allows Beijing to project its influence over areas important to its strategic objectives, such as the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. At the same time, the country protects its sea lines of communication (SLOCs for short) and ensures the maintenance of its economic growth, so vital to guarantee China’s hegemonic interests.\n\nRussia’s geopolitical actions have also represented an important challenge to American hegemony. Opposing NATO’s expansion towards Eastern Europe and noting the difficulty presented by the United States in achieving its objectives in the Middle East in the context of civil wars in Libya and Syria, Russia saw an opportunity to project power again in its historical areas of influence: Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In this sense, in 2014, facing anti-Russian influence protests in Ukraine and the possibility of the country’s entry into the European Union, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula to its territory based on a referendum. Moscow’s action was answered with economic and political sanctions from the West and triggered separatist conflicts in the Donbass region.⁵² It is plausible to argue that, in this context, economic sanctions had little effect, not dissuading Russia from continuing to project power over the region. Thus, in February 2022, once again challenging NATO’s presence on its borders and seeking a more favorable position to guarantee its strategic interests in Eastern Europe, Russia militarily invaded Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been taking shape since the annexation of Crimea.⁵³ Russia has also conducted a comprehensive modernization of its Armed Forces over the last few decades.⁵⁴ One of the main pillars of modernization was the development of the strategy defined by the West as hybrid warfare, which aims to exploit gray areas of international law.⁵⁵ Based on this strategic change and the understanding that cyber operations would be an important asymmetric capability for the challenging of the United States hegemony, Russia began to invest in the development of cyber capabilities, leading the country to be considered one of the main cyber actors in\n\n⁵⁰ See Elsa Kania &amp; John Costello, *The Strategic Support Force and the Future of Chinese Information Operations*, 3(1) The Cyber Defense Review 105, 105-112 (2018).\n\n⁵¹ Ibid.\n\n⁵² See Michael O.

    "the world and being constantly accused by the West of conducting cyber-attacks to guarantee its political and economic interests on the international scenario.⁵⁶\n\nRelations between Russia and China in recent years have suggested the formation of a strategic partnership between the two countries. In recent years, the countries have been signing new agreements and bilateral declarations that point to an economic, political and military rapprochement between them. The most recent of these documents is the “Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development (2022)”⁵⁷ which sets out the views of countries on the international system and the role of partnership in securing mutual goals. In the military field, in addition to cooperation in the field of the SCO, in recent years, Beijing and Moscow have organized a series of joint military exercises.\n\nHowever, the trend is that the partnership between China and Russia will not translate into a formal military alliance. The Belt and Road initiative has a major focus on Central Asia, projecting China as a regional leader in a region historically under Russian influence. At the same time, China publicly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, calling for a peaceful solution for the conflict. Hence, Russia and China, despite maintaining close relations aiming the erosion of the United States hegemony, base their actions on different sets of norms and behaviors, which may indicate a potential crisis in the relations between the two powers in the future.\n\nObserving the movements of China and Russia on the geopolitical chessboard, the United States, seeking to contain the erosion of its hegemony, undertook efforts to recover the credibility of its military and economic powers and curb Russian expansionism and the Chinese rise. Since the Donald Trump administration, the United States has taken on a more assertive discourse on this issue, initiating a Chinese product import taxation policy, triggering a trade war between the two largest economies in the world since March of 2018.⁵⁸ Despite an apparent normalization of the United States-China relations, still in 2022, the United States imposes technological curbing policies against China, seeking to prevent China’s access to high-tech chips, for example.⁵⁹\n\nIn the political-military field, one of the main objectives of the United States related to maintaining its hegemonic status was to strengthen its relations in the Indo-Pacific region, seeking to counterbalance the rising Chinese influence over the region. It is with this objective in mind that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (hereinafter referred to as QUAD) and the AUKUS Alliance come into play. The QUAD was re-established in 2017 and comprises a security dialogue initiative between the United States, Australia, Japan and India - countries that have somewhat turbulent relations with China. In recent years, the QUAD has organized joint military exercises and international summits, however expectations of a more formal partnership have not yet been met, raising doubts whether\n\n⁵⁶ See supra note 22.\n\n⁵⁷ See China &amp; Russia, Joint Statement of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the International Relations Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, http://en.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770 (accessed on November 4, 2022).\n\n⁵⁸ See K.

    "internal differences between the members would allow the QUAD to become a more present and operational initiative.⁶⁰\n\nThe trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (hereinafter referred to as the AUKUS) was established in 2021 with the aim of increasing security and development cooperation between the three countries. AUKUS gained global attention after the announcement that one of the first actions of the alliance would be the delivery of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines (hereinafter referred to as SSN) to Australia.⁶¹ Australia’s acquisition of an SSN will have important implications for the Pacific Ocean’s balance of power, particularly given the breakdown of relations between China and Australia in recent years. A nuclear submarine would be a major threat to China’s projection of naval power, placing Australia at the forefront of guaranteeing hegemonic interests of the United States. In this sense, the establishment of the AUKUS can be understood as a way for the United States to compensate for its relative loss of power in the Pacific, increasing the military capabilities of its greatest ally in the region.\n\nAs noted, in recent years the status of the United States as a hegemonic power has come to be openly questioned by important actors in the international system, such as China and Russia. Based on its economic growth, China seeks more influence in the international system, pursuing more prominence in main international institutions, modernizing its military power and projecting power over strategic areas for its security. Russia, identifying NATO’s expansionism towards Eastern Europe as a risk to its own security, annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and started a conflict with Ukraine in 2022. The United States, in turn, tries to keep its hegemon status, seeking to contain China’s economic growth, repress Russia’s expansionism and create new military alliances. Thus, the status quo is represented by a clash between three sets of rules and norms of behavior supported by three different great powers, constituting a systemic chaos. Having raised the main characteristics of cyberspace and the current status of the dispute for global power, the next section will explore how all of these factors influence the process of creating an institution capable of regulating cyberspace.\n\n## 4. Main Challenges for International Law\n\nThe process of creating rules in international law has historically faced a series of challenges, especially in discussions related to the conduct of warring parties. Contemporarily, when it comes to the incorporation of newly developed weapons into conflicts, there is a difficulty in adapting them to international law, which often leads to the use of these weapons before there is a legal structure capable of regulating it.⁶²\n\nAs discussed in the first section, the intrinsic characteristics of cyberspace make the process of attributing cyberattacks difficult. Due to the possibility of masking the origin of attacks, the attribution mechanisms currently available do not have the international credibility necessary to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted in their\n\n⁶⁰ See Thayná Ribeiro, *QUAD Summit: Challenges to Regional Security in the Indo-Pacific*, 136(1) Boletim Geocorrente 14, 14 (2021).\n\n⁶¹ See Manqing Cheng, *AUKUS: The Changing Dynamic and Its Regional Implications*, 2(1) European Journal of Development Studies 1, 1-7 (2022).\n\n⁶² See George Lucas, *Law, Ethics and Emerging Military Technologies: Confronting disruptive innovation*, Routledge, p. 1 (2022).",
    "territories. However, taking into account that a large volume of cyberattacks is carried out by private actors, the attribution dilemma encompasses other factors, that is, the difficulty to define in which situations accountability should be attributed to a State for operations conducted in its territory. It is debated whether this attribution should be made when the State controls the operation, when it funds the group, or when the State offers sanctuary to the group, among other situations.⁶³\n\nThe attribution dilemma could be resolved by creating an institution with international credibility to establish a standardized forensic process that could determine the origin of cyberattacks based on well-defined principles regarding the degree of involvement that would indicate accountability of a State.⁶⁴ Since it deals directly with the interests of the great powers, the creation of this institution would require an international environment conducive to cooperation. However, the scenario of systemic chaos discussed above creates obstacles for the creation of an institution with this behavior,⁶⁵ since in recent years there has been a tendency to attack the credibility of international institutions.\n\nOne of the pieces of evidence that the systemic chaos hampers international cooperation efforts is the above-mentioned trade war, which started with decision of the United States to tax Chinese products. Also in the economic field, the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (BREXIT), initiated in 2016 and completed in 2020, represented a great challenge for the economic bloc, since the United Kingdom represented, in 2015, the second largest economy in the European Union, accounting for about 17% of the Gross Domestic Product of the entire bloc.⁶⁶ Both actions happened in the context of a wave of protectionism and isolationism that marked the Western powers in recent years.\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF for short) Treaty that it had established with Russia since 1987. At the time, the signing of the treaty determined the destruction of the entire arsenal of land-based ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and missile launchers with ranges of 500–5,500km and prohibited the construction of new missiles with these configurations. The United States officially claimed that its withdrawal was linked to a series of violations of the agreement by Russia. However, the American decision also indicates a response to the modernization of China’s nuclear capabilities, whilst Beijing already positioned itself against its eventual inclusion in the Treaty.⁶⁷ The United States and Russia also withdrew from other arms control treaties, notably Open Skies, which allows participating countries to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other territories to observe advances in military capabilities.⁶⁸ These behaviors have a negative impact on\n\n⁶³ See supra note 26.\n\n⁶⁴ See supra note 13.\n\n⁶⁵ See supra note 2.\n\n⁶⁶ See International Monetary Fund, *World Economic Outlook Database 2015*, https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2015/October (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\n⁶⁷ See *United States Initiates Withdrawal from Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty*, 113(3) American Journal of International Law 631, 631-634 (2019).\n\n⁶⁸ See *United Nations, Treaty on Open Skies*, https://treaties.unoda.org/t/open_skies (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\n14",
    "international cooperation, intensifying “the nuclear security dilemma, which accelerates the arms race, resulting in the end of stability-enhancing arms control”⁶⁹\n\nDeriving from the systemic chaos created by the clash between the sets of norms and behaviors headed by the United States, China and Russia, the difficulty of consensus appears as an important obstacle to the creation of an internationally recognized regulation for cyber operations. As discussed earlier, the search for consensus was one of the main challenges faced by the group of experts who wrote Tallinn Manual 2.0.\n\nIn 2021, the International Institute of Strategic Studies (hereinafter referred to as IISS) published a report entitled “Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment” that raised the cyber capabilities of fifteen of the main actors in the international system, namely: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Vietnam. According to the report, although these countries have very different levels of cyber capabilities, they all understand cyberspace as a new and important arena for guaranteeing their interests and have been increasing their investments in cyber defense,⁷⁰ meaning these actors will most likely assume prominent positions on cyber capabilities in the future.\n\nHence, a cyberspace regulation institution that does not take into account the values of the countries mentioned in the report, would have little applicability, since it would most likely not be followed by such countries — especially those that do not cultivate values similar to those of the West. In the specific case of the United States, China and Russia, their geopolitical dispute shapes their views of cyberspace,⁷¹ which would most likely hinder the progress of the debates regarding cyberspace regulation. The presence of Iran and Israel on the list shows that regional conflicts could spill over to the process of establishing a cyberspace international regulation. At the same time, if the fifteen countries were to agree on the rules proposed, that would probably mean that the text of the legislation would potentially be broad and open to ambiguities, undermining the very effectiveness of international law as a tool for regulating the conduct of states in cyberspace.\n\nFinally, the role of the deliberate use of gray zone operations by states must also be considered. As discussed earlier, gray zone operations are found in all five strategic domains, but the characteristics of cyberspace enhance their use, as there is a low probability of having to deal with accountability mechanisms.⁷²\n\nThe Russian Federation is consistently associated with the use of gray zone operations, mainly because of its hybrid warfare doctrine, which combines conventional military tactics and non-military elements (such as psychological operations, cyberattacks, and sabotage) in ways that cause physical and psychological harm to an opponent.⁷³\n\n⁶⁹ See Nancy Teeple, *Offensive Weapons and the Future of Nuclear Arms Control*, 14(1) Canadian Journal of European and Russian Studies 79, 79-102 (2020).\n\n⁷⁰ See International Institute of Strategic Studies, *Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment*, https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-capabilities-national-power (accessed on November 15, 2022).\n\n⁷¹ See Matthew Bey, *Great Powers in Cyberspace: The Strategic Drivers Behind US, Chinese and Russian Competition*, 3(3) The Cyber Defense Review 31, 31 (2018).\n\n⁷² See supra note 14.\n\n⁷³ See Bettina Renz, *Russia and “Hybrid Warfare”*, 22(3) Contemporary Politics 283, 283-300 (2016).\n\n15",
    "Since the crisis that led to the annexation of Crimea by Russia, Moscow has been systematically accused of conducting of gray zone operations in Ukrainian territory, in order to achieve its political objectives without starting a conventional conflict. This strategy was changed in 2022, when Russia decided to militarily invade Ukrainian territory.⁷⁴ In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, NATO officially announced that cyberattacks on a member country of the organization would trigger Article 5⁷⁵ of its treaty.⁷⁶\n\nOther countries mentioned in the IISS report also regularly conduct gray zone operations to project power and secure their strategic interests. According to leaked documents from the National Security Agency (NSA for short) of the United States, in 2013 the United States conducted espionage operations against the presidents of Brazil and Mexico.⁷⁷ Russia also accused the United States of planting malwares in its energy grid, which would be activated in the event of a war.⁷⁸ China, for its part, has been consistently accused of conducting cyber espionage operations against commercial, military and governmental targets in order to further boost its economic growth and the modernization of the PLA.⁷⁹\n\nWhen conducting gray zone operations, states seek to establish advantages over their main competitors by circumventing some principles of international law. In this sense, the ambiguity generated by the use of gray zone operations ends up being understood as something positive by the states, since it provides a greater number of options for achieving their strategic, economic and political objectives. Michael Schmitt argues that the way to increase the efficiency of international law and curb the deliberate use of these operations by states is to reinforce the understanding that if a state benefits from the use of gray zone operations, so does their main international competitors.⁸⁰\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThe rise of ICTs and the formation of a systemic chaos scenario over the international system could be understood as two main events in the 21st century, directly impacting the relations between the great powers, placing cyberspace in a prominent position for contemporary conflict and evidencing the absence of regulation for cyber\n\n⁷⁴ See supra note 52.\n\n⁷⁵ Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty states that: “The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area”.

    "operations. Therefore, based on the elements addressed throughout this research, it was possible to draw some conclusions about the relationship between the status quo of the international system and the creation of a cyberspace regulation process.\n\nFirst of all, the main characteristics of cyberspace make it difficult to develop a regulation of cyber operations conducted or supported by states. The attribution difficulty and the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies hinder the creation of accountability mechanisms with international credibility in the light of international law. At the same time, the unpredictability of threats, generated by the predominant use of unsophisticated tools in cyberattacks, inhibits greater international cooperation on the issue, since the definition of the cyber capabilities of each State is not clear.\n\nSecond, despite the centrality of the cyber domain in contemporary conflict, there is no proposed regulation submitted so far. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 and the 2021 UN GGE Report are the examples that come closest to a formal proposal but are still very incipient and fail to address important aspects for an eventual formalization of the rules they propose, generating a series of criticisms from states, international organizations and scholars. The most concrete efforts are associated with combating transnational cybercrime, a trend that is not repeated in the context of operations conducted, financed or supported by states.\n\nThird, systemic chaos undermines the search for consensus, as it brings different values and norms into collision. Without the establishment of a consensus, an institution that regulates cyberspace would face a series of challenges in order to the reach the international credibility necessary to effectively exercise governance over the fifth domain. The search for consensus also proves challenging when analyzing the profile of the main countries mentioned in the report by the IISS, which have been increasing their cyber capabilities and disputing power influence at the regional and global level.\n\nFinally, the research suggests that states, to some extent, benefit from the use of gray zone operations, mainly associated with the cyber domain. An analysis of the behavior of the main military powers in recent years demonstrates moments in which gray zone operations were used by states to guarantee their main strategic objectives displayed in their official documents, taking advantage of loopholes in international regulations and avoiding committing to a conventional conflict. Therefore, greater regulation over cyber operations would imply a major limitation of a state’s options for action.\n\n17"

    "abstract": "Information technologies, as well as cyberspace, have assumed a central role in contemporary society, becoming essential for the functioning of the economic, political and social sectors of states and even their Armed Forces. In view of this situation, the main military powers in the world already consider cyberspace as a new strategic domain, investing in robust capabilities for conducting cyber operations. The first two decades of the 21st century were marked by empirical examples of cyber espionage, sabotage, denial of service and other cyber operations conducted in peacetime by state actors against other states' critical infrastructures. Thus, debates about the need for an international regulation of the behavior of states in cyberspace were raised. The absence of an international regulatory institution for cyberspace contributes to the creation of a gray zone of what kind of cyber operations would be allowed in peacetime. Although it is already possible to notice international cooperative efforts in the field of regulating and combating cybercrimes, such as data theft and cyber terrorism, the same trend is not repeated in the scope of cyber operations conducted by states with political and economic objectives. In this sense, this research aims to address the impact of the current international power dispute on the process of creating an international institution capable of regulating cyberspace. The main argument is that the absence of an established hegemony and the subsequent clash of interests of the world's major military and cyber powers hampers the process of creating such an institution with global credibility. As for the methodological aspects, this work represents an inductive, exploratory and mostly qualitative research. Data will be collected from the analysis of official documents, bibliographic research and the use of databases. As for its justification, this research aims to contribute to greater regulation and governance of cyberspace through the understanding of the strategic interests that shape the decisions of the main state actors involved in the debate.",
