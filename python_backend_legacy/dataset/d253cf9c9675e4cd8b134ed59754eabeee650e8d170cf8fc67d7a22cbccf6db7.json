All digital technologies that receive, transmit, and manage digital data are potentially vulnerable to digital interference, which are called cyber attacks. These attacks range from data theft, to financial fraud, manipulation of data, or manipulation of machine instructions. Recent events and studies demonstrate how digital technologies are vulnerable to cyber attacks in many sectors, including energy production, shipping, space-based satellites, and financial transactions. Such attacks have the potential to wreak havoc either as part of a wider conflict or as one-off terror attacks.\n\nThe use of cyber attacks by a range of States aimed at disrupting and undermining institutional confidence, among other ambitions, is disrupting geopolitical stability. These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons. Many studies on these developments along with traditional thinking on strategic stability focus on the role of political resolve and \"red lines\". Less focus has been devoted to the role of technology in strategic stability and its impact on credibility and increasing uncertainty.\n\nIn the event of crisis escalation—such as over events in Ukraine, the Middle East, or Asia—the assumption is that weapons systems will perform as planned. But this is not a safe assumption. Any cyber interference with one or more parts of strategic weapons systems would undo the precarious balance of perceived deterrence and stability, and create confusion and uncertainty as to its origin, which could lead to inaccurate, inadequate, and hasty responses and the possibility of conventional and nuclear war. Loss of trust in technology has further implications for attribution and strategic calculus in crisis decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception. $^{1}$  This has implications for all States that rely on nuclear weapons in\n\n$^{1}$ R.J.

Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\n\nP.M.

For example, information regarding personnel, nuclear facility layout, design and operational information, or specific tasks such as security personnel shifts are stored within computer-based information systems and could be susceptible to cyber attacks that lead to either high or low levels of consequence.³ Data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, and theft including cyber espionage are serious but, depending on the nature of the act, the information stolen, and when it was detected, need not necessarily lead to danger.⁴\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system ... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.⁵\n\n## The ubiquity of interconnectivity\n\nThe myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\n\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and\n\n³ A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n\n⁴ See A.

Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n\n⁶ J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12\n\nIn the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n\n11 A.

These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\n\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking.[16] In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part.[17] A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.[18]\n\nMilitary strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems.

As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”.²¹ This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure.²² PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n\n¹⁹ NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight.²³ Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force.²⁴ In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours.²⁵ The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack.

Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority.²⁶ An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat.²⁷ Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine.²⁸ Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\n\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country.

Several physical attacks have occurred, for instance, in Pakistan's nuclear weapon bases.³⁰ In the attempted coup in Turkey, power was cut off for several hours on and off for several days at the Incirlik airbase where the United States nuclear weapons are stationed.³¹ Although nuclear weapons bases are heavily guarded and physically protected, security challenges of today exceed the physical dimensions of protection and require cyber diligence. For instance, assessments of insider threat risks to computer systems have been carried out in other areas.³² By having easy access to computer systems, a person with malicious intent could steal data and information, including critical design information, operating information, and sensitive personnel data, and could sell this information to others—either to hostile governments or to non-state armed groups.\n\nA final \"insider\" threat scenario involves individuals beyond the facility. Due to lack of technical knowledge, sources and capacity, nuclear weapons States work with outside defence companies—in designing and building industrial control systems, for instance in a nuclear weapons base, or in submarine systems.³³ Many work closely with the weapons complexes for decades and have stringent vetting procedures, but they may subcontract some of the work to other smaller companies that may not have the required procedures in place. This type of outsourcing can increase the likelihood of systems vulnerability.

The possessors of nuclear weapons, and those alliance countries that host them or otherwise incorporate them into their defence postures, need to be fully aware of the threats and risks posed to their citizens as well as to the populations of countries at which these weapons may be aimed.\n\nThe increasing number of cyber attacks in other domains, including on critical national and international infrastructures, suggests that the nuclear weapons establishments may face similar potential attacks. It may be that the technical measures taken to defend against such attacks, along with air gaps and rigorous training for cyber hygiene and protection, will be adequate to prevent those attacks from having any serious impacts. It is likely however that information theft will occur—such as names and addresses of personnel or facility layout and design—and the integrity and security of data could be compromised.\n\nWhat is needed then is an all-cyber-risks-based approach in nuclear weapons systems to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences against all critical assets. Today state capabilities are viewed as the biggest threats to a state's critical infrastructure; yet, the nature of vulnerability and evolution of technology will likely provide more opportunities for terrorist groups to conduct high-consequence incidents in the future. A graded approach to cyber security in nuclear weapons and systems complex calls for vulnerability assessment of each layer, including command and control systems, communication systems including satellites, space infrastructure, and targeting. It calls for the identification of critical components, assesses the likelihood of insider threat, and requires an efficient and timely reporting structure.\n\nPerhaps the single most significant impact of potential cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is that the certainty of information will be questioned. When Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov judged that he \"couldn't trust the computers\" and decided that the signals of incoming missiles from the United States to the Soviet Union at the height of tensions in 1983 were a false alarm, he was factoring in the uncertainty of the vulnerability of the technology on which he was supposed to rely.³⁵ He was correct to do so.

All digital technologies that receive, transmit, and manage digital data are potentially vulnerable to digital interference, which are called cyber attacks. These attacks range from data theft, to financial fraud, manipulation of data, or manipulation of machine instructions. Recent events and studies demonstrate how digital technologies are vulnerable to cyber attacks in many sectors, including energy production, shipping, space-based satellites, and financial transactions. Such attacks have the potential to wreak havoc either as part of a wider conflict or as one-off terror attacks.\nThe use of cyber attacks by a range of States aimed at disrupting and undermining institutional confidence, among other ambitions, is disrupting geopolitical stability. These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons. Many studies on these developments along with traditional thinking on strategic stability focus on the role of political resolve and \"red lines\". Less focus has been devoted to the role of technology in strategic stability and its impact on credibility and increasing uncertainty.\nIn the event of crisis escalation—such as over events in Ukraine, the Middle East, or Asia—the assumption is that weapons systems will perform as planned. But this is not a safe assumption. Any cyber interference with one or more parts of strategic weapons systems would undo the precarious balance of perceived deterrence and stability, and create confusion and uncertainty as to its origin, which could lead to inaccurate, inadequate, and hasty responses and the possibility of conventional and nuclear war. Loss of trust in technology has further implications for attribution and strategic calculus in crisis decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception. $^{1}$  This has implications for all States that rely on nuclear weapons in\n$^{1}$ R.J. Danzig, Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Reducing the National Security Risks of America’s Cyber Dependencies, Centre for a New American Security, July 2014, https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_PoisonedFruit_Danzig.pdf; and\ntheir security planning, whether possessing their own nuclear weapons capabilities or through being part of a nuclear military alliance.\nThe cyber threat is one of the most important and yet under-considered concerns of our time.² If left unaddressed, cyber vulnerabilities of the strategic security infrastructure will result in severe consequences for national and international security.\n## Cyber technology vulnerabilities\nThe cyber vulnerable technologies in the nuclear weapons systems—both in the countries that possess them and in those where they are stationed—include:\n- communications between command and control centres;\n- communications from command stations to missile platforms (e.g. submarines) and missiles;\n- telemetry data from missiles to ground- and space-based command and control assets;\n- analytical centres for gathering and interpreting long-term and real-time intelligence;\n- cyber technologies in transport;\n- cyber technologies in laboratories and assembly facilities;\n- pre-launch targeting information for upload;\n- real-time targeting information from space-based systems including positional, navigational, and timing data from global navigational systems;\n- real-time weather information from space-, air-, and ground-based sensors;\n- positioning data for launch platforms (e.g. submarines);\n- real-time targeting information from ground stations;\n- communications between allied command centres; and\n- robotic autonomous systems within the strategic infrastructure.\n## Differential impacts\nCyber vulnerability in nuclear weapons systems is all about connectivity and data integrity. Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\nP.M. Lewis et al., *Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy*, Chatham House, 2014.\n² See National Threat Initiative, Project: Cyber-Nuclear Weapons Study Group, http://www.nti.org/about/projects/cyber-nuclear-weapons-study-group/.\n62\nNot all attacks on data are the same. While all data attacks are serious, some are far more serious than others. For example, information regarding personnel, nuclear facility layout, design and operational information, or specific tasks such as security personnel shifts are stored within computer-based information systems and could be susceptible to cyber attacks that lead to either high or low levels of consequence.³ Data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, and theft including cyber espionage are serious but, depending on the nature of the act, the information stolen, and when it was detected, need not necessarily lead to danger.⁴\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system ... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.⁵\n## The ubiquity of interconnectivity\nThe myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and\n³ A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n⁴ See A.

For instance, the United States is modernizing its integrated communications system (Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN)) to be able to have efficient and integrated nuclear systems—including \"facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel\"; this includes the crypto-interoperability of its critical management structure.¹⁰ Artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems (AI/RAS), are also revolutionizing the ways in which security is managed in the military nuclear sector. Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n⁶ J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12\nIn the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n11 A.

These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking.[16] In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part.[17] A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.[18]\nMilitary strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems. Cyber attacks on satellites would undermine the\n[16] D. Livingstone and P.

As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”.²¹ This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure.²² PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n¹⁹ NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

Because cyber technologies are within the grasp of most States and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.\nMany missile systems depend heavily on positional, navigational, and timing (PNT) data from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) operated by the United States, Russia, and Europe. They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight.²³ Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force.²⁴ In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours.²⁵ The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack. New GNSS satellite constellations—including regional and global systems from Europe and Asia—aim to reduce risks through increased resilience.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.\n²³ The Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM is equipped with an on-board GNSS receiver and more recent modifications of the Trident D5 ballistic missile include GNSS features as part of the otherwise self-contained on-board guidance system and includes a digital interface with the launch boat. Russia’s short-range Iskander missile employs an optical guidance warhead, by which the missile can be controlled by encrypted radio transmissions.\n²⁴ The GNSS networks currently available are the United States’ GPS, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), EGNOS and the new Galileo GNSS. China has developed a regional satellite navigation system, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and is now developing a GNSS (BeiDou-2) with the aim of global operation by 2020. India has a regional system NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation, formerly called IRNSS) and Japan is also developing a regional system, the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n²⁵ C. Baraniuk, “GPS error caused ‘12 hours of problems’ for companies”, BBC, 4 February 2016, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491962.\n68\n# Insider threats\nAnother understudied issue concerns insider threats in nuclear weapons facilities and platforms, nuclear bases in nuclear weapons States and host countries, and in nuclear weapons laboratories. Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority.²⁶ An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat.²⁷ Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine.²⁸ Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country. For instance, in Japan—a country under the nuclear weapons protection of the United States—personnel vetting systems for trustworthiness do not exist.²⁹ Establishing a security culture that builds\n---\n²⁶ IAEA, Preventive and Protective Measures against Insider Threats, Implementing Guide, IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 8, 2008, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1359_web.pdf.\n²⁷ Ibid.\n²⁸ BBC News, “Sailor who murdered officer on submarine HMS Astute jailed for life”, 19 September 2011, http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14971198.\n²⁹ E.

The possessors of nuclear weapons, and those alliance countries that host them or otherwise incorporate them into their defence postures, need to be fully aware of the threats and risks posed to their citizens as well as to the populations of countries at which these weapons may be aimed.\nThe increasing number of cyber attacks in other domains, including on critical national and international infrastructures, suggests that the nuclear weapons establishments may face similar potential attacks. It may be that the technical measures taken to defend against such attacks, along with air gaps and rigorous training for cyber hygiene and protection, will be adequate to prevent those attacks from having any serious impacts. It is likely however that information theft will occur—such as names and addresses of personnel or facility layout and design—and the integrity and security of data could be compromised.\nWhat is needed then is an all-cyber-risks-based approach in nuclear weapons systems to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences against all critical assets. Today state capabilities are viewed as the biggest threats to a state's critical infrastructure; yet, the nature of vulnerability and evolution of technology will likely provide more opportunities for terrorist groups to conduct high-consequence incidents in the future. A graded approach to cyber security in nuclear weapons and systems complex calls for vulnerability assessment of each layer, including command and control systems, communication systems including satellites, space infrastructure, and targeting. It calls for the identification of critical components, assesses the likelihood of insider threat, and requires an efficient and timely reporting structure.\nPerhaps the single most significant impact of potential cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is that the certainty of information will be questioned. When Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov judged that he \"couldn't trust the computers\" and decided that the signals of incoming missiles from the United States to the Soviet Union at the height of tensions in 1983 were a false alarm, he was factoring in the uncertainty of the vulnerability of the technology on which he was supposed to rely.³⁵ He was correct to do so.

All digital technologies that receive, transmit, and manage digital data are potentially vulnerable to digital interference, which are called cyber attacks. These attacks range from data theft, to financial fraud, manipulation of data, or manipulation of machine instructions. Recent events and studies demonstrate how digital technologies are vulnerable to cyber attacks in many sectors, including energy production, shipping, space-based satellites, and financial transactions. Such attacks have the potential to wreak havoc either as part of a wider conflict or as one-off terror attacks.\nThe use of cyber attacks by a range of States aimed at disrupting and undermining institutional confidence, among other ambitions, is disrupting geopolitical stability. These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons. Many studies on these developments along with traditional thinking on strategic stability focus on the role of political resolve and \"red lines\". Less focus has been devoted to the role of technology in strategic stability and its impact on credibility and increasing uncertainty.\nIn the event of crisis escalation—such as over events in Ukraine, the Middle East, or Asia—the assumption is that weapons systems will perform as planned. But this is not a safe assumption. Any cyber interference with one or more parts of strategic weapons systems would undo the precarious balance of perceived deterrence and stability, and create confusion and uncertainty as to its origin, which could lead to inaccurate, inadequate, and hasty responses and the possibility of conventional and nuclear war. Loss of trust in technology has further implications for attribution and strategic calculus in crisis decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception. $^{1}$  This has implications for all States that rely on nuclear weapons in\n$^{1}$ R.J. Danzig, Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Reducing the National Security Risks of America’s Cyber Dependencies, Centre for a New American Security, July 2014, https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_PoisonedFruit_Danzig.pdf; and\ntheir security planning, whether possessing their own nuclear weapons capabilities or through being part of a nuclear military alliance.\nThe cyber threat is one of the most important and yet under-considered concerns of our time. If left unaddressed, cyber vulnerabilities of the strategic security infrastructure will result in severe consequences for national and international security.\n## Cyber technology vulnerabilities\nThe cyber vulnerable technologies in the nuclear weapons systems—both in the countries that possess them and in those where they are stationed—include:\n- communications between command and control centres;\n- communications from command stations to missile platforms (e.g. submarines) and missiles;\n- telemetry data from missiles to ground- and space-based command and control assets;\n- analytical centres for gathering and interpreting long-term and real-time intelligence;\n- cyber technologies in transport;\n- cyber technologies in laboratories and assembly facilities;\n- pre-launch targeting information for upload;\n- real-time targeting information from space-based systems including positional, navigational, and timing data from global navigational systems;\n- real-time weather information from space-, air-, and ground-based sensors;\n- positioning data for launch platforms (e.g. submarines);\n- real-time targeting information from ground stations;\n- communications between allied command centres; and\n- robotic autonomous systems within the strategic infrastructure.\n## Differential impacts\nCyber vulnerability in nuclear weapons systems is all about connectivity and data integrity. Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\nP.M. Lewis et al., *Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy*, Chatham House, 2014.\n See National Threat Initiative, Project: Cyber-Nuclear Weapons Study Group, http://www.nti.org/about/projects/cyber-nuclear-weapons-study-group/.\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system ... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.\n## The ubiquity of interconnectivity\nThe myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and\n A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n See A.

Submarines receive weather updates, as water temperature level and salinity are conditions for successful submarine disguise strategy, potentially linking their systems to an outside network. Other periods of cyber vulnerability include malware introduced to the network at the design phase or during maintenance. A comprehensive risk assessment on submarines would require a vulnerability assessment of each critical component and point of connectivity, including stealth, navigation, reactor, and missiles.\n## The future of command, control, and communication\nNew technologies are being used as part of targeting, command, and control or communication. For instance, the United States is modernizing its integrated communications system (Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN)) to be able to have efficient and integrated nuclear systems—including \"facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel\"; this includes the crypto-interoperability of its critical management structure. Artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems (AI/RAS), are also revolutionizing the ways in which security is managed in the military nuclear sector. Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12\nIn the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n\nThe vulnerability of space assets and space-based technologies to cyber attack could undermine the safety, reliability, and credibility of nuclear and conventional weapons systems. These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking.[16] In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part.[17] A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.[18]\nMilitary strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems. Cyber attacks on satellites would undermine the\n[16] D. Livingstone and P.

As stated in the 2011 United States International Strategy for Cyberspace, international approaches and cooperation are needed in order to address and mitigate the full range of cyber threats to military systems and space assets.\nThe United States has been taking this issue seriously for over 20 years. As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”. This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure. PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

Because cyber technologies are within the grasp of most States and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.\nMany missile systems depend heavily on positional, navigational, and timing (PNT) data from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) operated by the United States, Russia, and Europe. They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight. Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force. In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours. The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack. New GNSS satellite constellations—including regional and global systems from Europe and Asia—aim to reduce risks through increased resilience.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.\n The Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM is equipped with an on-board GNSS receiver and more recent modifications of the Trident D5 ballistic missile include GNSS features as part of the otherwise self-contained on-board guidance system and includes a digital interface with the launch boat. Russia’s short-range Iskander missile employs an optical guidance warhead, by which the missile can be controlled by encrypted radio transmissions.\n The GNSS networks currently available are the United States’ GPS, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), EGNOS and the new Galileo GNSS. China has developed a regional satellite navigation system, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and is now developing a GNSS (BeiDou-2) with the aim of global operation by 2020. India has a regional system NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation, formerly called IRNSS) and Japan is also developing a regional system, the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n C. Baraniuk, “GPS error caused ‘12 hours of problems’ for companies”, BBC, 4 February 2016, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491962.\n\nAnother understudied issue concerns insider threats in nuclear weapons facilities and platforms, nuclear bases in nuclear weapons States and host countries, and in nuclear weapons laboratories. Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority. An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat. Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine. Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country. For instance, in Japan—a country under the nuclear weapons protection of the United States—personnel vetting systems for trustworthiness do not exist. Establishing a security culture that builds\n---\n IAEA, Preventive and Protective Measures against Insider Threats, Implementing Guide, IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 8, 2008, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1359_web.pdf.\n Ibid.\n BBC News, “Sailor who murdered officer on submarine HMS Astute jailed for life”, 19 September 2011, http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14971198.\n E.

Several physical attacks have occurred, for instance, in Pakistan's nuclear weapon bases.

By having easy access to computer systems, a person with malicious intent could steal data and information, including critical design information, operating information, and sensitive personnel data, and could sell this information to others—either to hostile governments or to non-state armed groups.\nA final \"insider\" threat scenario involves individuals beyond the facility.

Many work closely with the weapons complexes for decades and have stringent vetting procedures, but they may subcontract some of the work to other smaller companies that may not have the required procedures in place.

All digital technologies that receive, transmit, and manage digital data are potentially vulnerable to digital interference, which are called cyber attacks. These attacks range from data theft, to financial fraud, manipulation of data, or manipulation of machine instructions. Recent events and studies demonstrate how digital technologies are vulnerable to cyber attacks in many sectors, including energy production, shipping, space-based satellites, and financial transactions. Such attacks have the potential to wreak havoc either as part of a wider conflict or as one-off terror attacks.\nThe use of cyber attacks by a range of States aimed at disrupting and undermining institutional confidence, among other ambitions, is disrupting geopolitical stability. These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons. Many studies on these developments along with traditional thinking on strategic stability focus on the role of political resolve and \"red lines\". Less focus has been devoted to the role of technology in strategic stability and its impact on credibility and increasing uncertainty.\nIn the event of crisis escalation—such as over events in Ukraine, the Middle East, or Asia—the assumption is that weapons systems will perform as planned. But this is not a safe assumption. Any cyber interference with one or more parts of strategic weapons systems would undo the precarious balance of perceived deterrence and stability, and create confusion and uncertainty as to its origin, which could lead to inaccurate, inadequate, and hasty responses and the possibility of conventional and nuclear war. Loss of trust in technology has further implications for attribution and strategic calculus in crisis decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception. $^{1}$  This has implications for all States that rely on nuclear weapons in\n$^{1}$ R.J. Danzig, Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Reducing the National Security Risks of America’s Cyber Dependencies, Centre for a New American Security, July 2014, https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_PoisonedFruit_Danzig.pdf; and\ntheir security planning, whether possessing their own nuclear weapons capabilities or through being part of a nuclear military alliance.\nThe cyber threat is one of the most important and yet under-considered concerns of our time. If left unaddressed, cyber vulnerabilities of the strategic security infrastructure will result in severe consequences for national and international security.\n## Cyber technology vulnerabilities\nThe cyber vulnerable technologies in the nuclear weapons systems—both in the countries that possess them and in those where they are stationed—include:\n- communications between command and control centres;\n- communications from command stations to missile platforms (e.g. submarines) and missiles;\n- telemetry data from missiles to ground- and space-based command and control assets;\n- analytical centres for gathering and interpreting long-term and real-time intelligence;\n- cyber technologies in transport;\n- cyber technologies in laboratories and assembly facilities;\n- pre-launch targeting information for upload;\n- real-time targeting information from space-based systems including positional, navigational, and timing data from global navigational systems;\n- real-time weather information from space-, air-, and ground-based sensors;\n- positioning data for launch platforms (e.g. submarines);\n- real-time targeting information from ground stations;\n- communications between allied command centres; and\n- robotic autonomous systems within the strategic infrastructure.\n## Differential impacts\nCyber vulnerability in nuclear weapons systems is all about connectivity and data integrity. Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\nP.M. Lewis et al., *Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy*, Chatham House, 2014.\n See National Threat Initiative, Project: Cyber-Nuclear Weapons Study Group, http://www.nti.org/about/projects/cyber-nuclear-weapons-study-group/.\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system ... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.\n## The ubiquity of interconnectivity\nThe myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and\n A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n See A.

Submarines receive weather updates, as water temperature level and salinity are conditions for successful submarine disguise strategy, potentially linking their systems to an outside network. Other periods of cyber vulnerability include malware introduced to the network at the design phase or during maintenance. A comprehensive risk assessment on submarines would require a vulnerability assessment of each critical component and point of connectivity, including stealth, navigation, reactor, and missiles.\n## The future of command, control, and communication\nNew technologies are being used as part of targeting, command, and control or communication. For instance, the United States is modernizing its integrated communications system (Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN)) to be able to have efficient and integrated nuclear systems—including \"facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel\"; this includes the crypto-interoperability of its critical management structure. Artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems (AI/RAS), are also revolutionizing the ways in which security is managed in the military nuclear sector. Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12\nIn the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n\nThe vulnerability of space assets and space-based technologies to cyber attack could undermine the safety, reliability, and credibility of nuclear and conventional weapons systems. These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking.[16] In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part.[17] A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.[18]\nMilitary strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems. Cyber attacks on satellites would undermine the\n[16] D. Livingstone and P.

As stated in the 2011 United States International Strategy for Cyberspace, international approaches and cooperation are needed in order to address and mitigate the full range of cyber threats to military systems and space assets.\nThe United States has been taking this issue seriously for over 20 years. As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”. This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure. PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

Because cyber technologies are within the grasp of most States and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.\nMany missile systems depend heavily on positional, navigational, and timing (PNT) data from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) operated by the United States, Russia, and Europe. They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight. Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force. In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours. The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack. New GNSS satellite constellations—including regional and global systems from Europe and Asia—aim to reduce risks through increased resilience.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.\n The Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM is equipped with an on-board GNSS receiver and more recent modifications of the Trident D5 ballistic missile include GNSS features as part of the otherwise self-contained on-board guidance system and includes a digital interface with the launch boat. Russia’s short-range Iskander missile employs an optical guidance warhead, by which the missile can be controlled by encrypted radio transmissions.\n The GNSS networks currently available are the United States’ GPS, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), EGNOS and the new Galileo GNSS. China has developed a regional satellite navigation system, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and is now developing a GNSS (BeiDou-2) with the aim of global operation by 2020. India has a regional system NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation, formerly called IRNSS) and Japan is also developing a regional system, the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n C. Baraniuk, “GPS error caused ‘12 hours of problems’ for companies”, BBC, 4 February 2016, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491962.\n\nAnother understudied issue concerns insider threats in nuclear weapons facilities and platforms, nuclear bases in nuclear weapons States and host countries, and in nuclear weapons laboratories. Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority. An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat. Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine. Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country. For instance, in Japan—a country under the nuclear weapons protection of the United States—personnel vetting systems for trustworthiness do not exist. Establishing a security culture that builds\n---\n IAEA, Preventive and Protective Measures against Insider Threats, Implementing Guide, IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 8, 2008, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1359_web.pdf.\n Ibid.\n BBC News, “Sailor who murdered officer on submarine HMS Astute jailed for life”, 19 September 2011, http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14971198.\n E. Blandford and S. Sagan (eds.), Learning from a Disaster: Improving Nuclear Safety and Security After Fukushima, Stanford University Press, 2016, p. 65.\non understanding the consequences of such actions is fundamental to mitigating threats.\nInsider threat risks increase in significance in countries that are facing crises, including militant and terrorist attacks. Several physical attacks have occurred, for instance, in Pakistan's nuclear weapon bases. In the attempted coup in Turkey, power was cut off for several hours on and off for several days at the Incirlik airbase where the United States nuclear weapons are stationed. Although nuclear weapons bases are heavily guarded and physically protected, security challenges of today exceed the physical dimensions of protection and require cyber diligence. For instance, assessments of insider threat risks to computer systems have been carried out in other areas. By having easy access to computer systems, a person with malicious intent could steal data and information, including critical design information, operating information, and sensitive personnel data, and could sell this information to others—either to hostile governments or to non-state armed groups.\nA final \"insider\" threat scenario involves individuals beyond the facility. Due to lack of technical knowledge, sources and capacity, nuclear weapons States work with outside defence companies—in designing and building industrial control systems, for instance in a nuclear weapons base, or in submarine systems. Many work closely with the weapons complexes for decades and have stringent vetting procedures, but they may subcontract some of the work to other smaller companies that may not have the required procedures in place. This type of outsourcing can increase the likelihood of systems vulnerability. Routine performance and maintenance screening on nuclear weapons command and control systems conducted by outside companies, even in rare cases, are similar pathways for malware penetration in the systems.\n D. Nelson and T. Hussain, “Militants attack Pakistan nuclear air base”, *The Telegraph*, 16 August 2012, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9479041/Militants-attack-Pakistan-nuclear-air-base.html.\n J.

Ingram, “A primer on Trident’s vulnerabilities”, *Parliamentary Briefings on Trident Renewal Briefing No. 2*, BASIC, March 2016, http://www.basicint.org/sites/default/files/BASIC_cyber_vuln_mar2016.pdf.\n Outsourcing is common in information technology systems, but rare in information control systems.\n\nAscertaining the threats and vulnerabilities to the nuclear weapons systems from cyber attacks is vital in understanding the changing risk picture associated with nuclear weapons. The possessors of nuclear weapons, and those alliance countries that host them or otherwise incorporate them into their defence postures, need to be fully aware of the threats and risks posed to their citizens as well as to the populations of countries at which these weapons may be aimed.\nThe increasing number of cyber attacks in other domains, including on critical national and international infrastructures, suggests that the nuclear weapons establishments may face similar potential attacks. It may be that the technical measures taken to defend against such attacks, along with air gaps and rigorous training for cyber hygiene and protection, will be adequate to prevent those attacks from having any serious impacts. It is likely however that information theft will occur—such as names and addresses of personnel or facility layout and design—and the integrity and security of data could be compromised.\nWhat is needed then is an all-cyber-risks-based approach in nuclear weapons systems to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences against all critical assets. Today state capabilities are viewed as the biggest threats to a state's critical infrastructure; yet, the nature of vulnerability and evolution of technology will likely provide more opportunities for terrorist groups to conduct high-consequence incidents in the future. A graded approach to cyber security in nuclear weapons and systems complex calls for vulnerability assessment of each layer, including command and control systems, communication systems including satellites, space infrastructure, and targeting. It calls for the identification of critical components, assesses the likelihood of insider threat, and requires an efficient and timely reporting structure.\nPerhaps the single most significant impact of potential cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is that the certainty of information will be questioned. When Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov judged that he \"couldn't trust the computers\" and decided that the signals of incoming missiles from the United States to the Soviet Union at the height of tensions in 1983 were a false alarm, he was factoring in the uncertainty of the vulnerability of the technology on which he was supposed to rely. He was correct to do so. Former United States Defense Secretary William Perry's account of how a crisis-simulation training tape was left inadvertently in the computer at North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) leading the United States command to believe—for a short while—that 200 Soviet missiles were incoming\n P. Anthony (director), The Man Who Saved the World, documentary film, 2014, http://themanwhosavedtheworldmovie.com.\nillustrates one possible form a cyber attack could take. Possible cyber interference in the data, management, and operations of nuclear weapons systems increases the uncertainties in the decision-making. In a crisis, with little time to spare, how will these additional uncertainties play out? If the fundamental information cannot be trusted, how do the humans in charge make decisions?\n W.J.

All digital technologies that receive, transmit, and manage digital data are potentially vulnerable to digital interference, which are called cyber attacks. These attacks range from data theft, to financial fraud, manipulation of data, or manipulation of machine instructions. Recent events and studies demonstrate how digital technologies are vulnerable to cyber attacks in many sectors, including energy production, shipping, space-based satellites, and financial transactions. Such attacks have the potential to wreak havoc either as part of a wider conflict or as one-off terror attacks.\nThe use of cyber attacks by a range of States aimed at disrupting and undermining institutional confidence, among other ambitions, is disrupting geopolitical stability. These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons. Many studies on these developments along with traditional thinking on strategic stability focus on the role of political resolve and \"red lines\". Less focus has been devoted to the role of technology in strategic stability and its impact on credibility and increasing uncertainty.\nIn the event of crisis escalation—such as over events in Ukraine, the Middle East, or Asia—the assumption is that weapons systems will perform as planned. But this is not a safe assumption. Any cyber interference with one or more parts of strategic weapons systems would undo the precarious balance of perceived deterrence and stability, and create confusion and uncertainty as to its origin, which could lead to inaccurate, inadequate, and hasty responses and the possibility of conventional and nuclear war. Loss of trust in technology has further implications for attribution and strategic calculus in crisis decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception. $^{1}$  This has implications for all States that rely on nuclear weapons in\n$^{1}$ R.J. Danzig, Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Reducing the National Security Risks of America’s Cyber Dependencies, Centre for a New American Security, July 2014, https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_PoisonedFruit_Danzig.pdf; and\ntheir security planning, whether possessing their own nuclear weapons capabilities or through being part of a nuclear military alliance.\nThe cyber threat is one of the most important and yet under-considered concerns of our time. If left unaddressed, cyber vulnerabilities of the strategic security infrastructure will result in severe consequences for national and international security.\n## Cyber technology vulnerabilities\nThe cyber vulnerable technologies in the nuclear weapons systems—both in the countries that possess them and in those where they are stationed—include:\n- communications between command and control centres;\n- communications from command stations to missile platforms (e.g. submarines) and missiles;\n- telemetry data from missiles to ground- and space-based command and control assets;\n- analytical centres for gathering and interpreting long-term and real-time intelligence;\n- cyber technologies in transport;\n- cyber technologies in laboratories and assembly facilities;\n- pre-launch targeting information for upload;\n- real-time targeting information from space-based systems including positional, navigational, and timing data from global navigational systems;\n- real-time weather information from space-, air-, and ground-based sensors;\n- positioning data for launch platforms (e.g. submarines);\n- real-time targeting information from ground stations;\n- communications between allied command centres; and\n- robotic autonomous systems within the strategic infrastructure.\n## Differential impacts\nCyber vulnerability in nuclear weapons systems is all about connectivity and data integrity. Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\nP.M. Lewis et al., *Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy*, Chatham House, 2014.\n See National Threat Initiative, Project: Cyber-Nuclear Weapons Study Group, http://www.nti.org/about/projects/cyber-nuclear-weapons-study-group/.\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system ... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.\n## The ubiquity of interconnectivity\nThe myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and\n A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n See A.

Submarines receive weather updates, as water temperature level and salinity are conditions for successful submarine disguise strategy, potentially linking their systems to an outside network. Other periods of cyber vulnerability include malware introduced to the network at the design phase or during maintenance. A comprehensive risk assessment on submarines would require a vulnerability assessment of each critical component and point of connectivity, including stealth, navigation, reactor, and missiles.\n## The future of command, control, and communication\nNew technologies are being used as part of targeting, command, and control or communication. For instance, the United States is modernizing its integrated communications system (Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN)) to be able to have efficient and integrated nuclear systems—including \"facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel\"; this includes the crypto-interoperability of its critical management structure. Artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems (AI/RAS), are also revolutionizing the ways in which security is managed in the military nuclear sector. Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12\nIn the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n\nThe vulnerability of space assets and space-based technologies to cyber attack could undermine the safety, reliability, and credibility of nuclear and conventional weapons systems. These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking.[16] In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part.[17] A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.[18]\nMilitary strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems. Cyber attacks on satellites would undermine the\n[16] D. Livingstone and P.

As stated in the 2011 United States International Strategy for Cyberspace, international approaches and cooperation are needed in order to address and mitigate the full range of cyber threats to military systems and space assets.\nThe United States has been taking this issue seriously for over 20 years. As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”. This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure. PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

Because cyber technologies are within the grasp of most States and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.\nMany missile systems depend heavily on positional, navigational, and timing (PNT) data from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) operated by the United States, Russia, and Europe. They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight. Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force. In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours. The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack. New GNSS satellite constellations—including regional and global systems from Europe and Asia—aim to reduce risks through increased resilience.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.\n The Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM is equipped with an on-board GNSS receiver and more recent modifications of the Trident D5 ballistic missile include GNSS features as part of the otherwise self-contained on-board guidance system and includes a digital interface with the launch boat. Russia’s short-range Iskander missile employs an optical guidance warhead, by which the missile can be controlled by encrypted radio transmissions.\n The GNSS networks currently available are the United States’ GPS, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), EGNOS and the new Galileo GNSS. China has developed a regional satellite navigation system, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and is now developing a GNSS (BeiDou-2) with the aim of global operation by 2020. India has a regional system NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation, formerly called IRNSS) and Japan is also developing a regional system, the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n C. Baraniuk, “GPS error caused ‘12 hours of problems’ for companies”, BBC, 4 February 2016, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491962.\n\nAnother understudied issue concerns insider threats in nuclear weapons facilities and platforms, nuclear bases in nuclear weapons States and host countries, and in nuclear weapons laboratories. Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority. An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat. Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine. Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country. For instance, in Japan—a country under the nuclear weapons protection of the United States—personnel vetting systems for trustworthiness do not exist. Establishing a security culture that builds\n---\n IAEA, Preventive and Protective Measures against Insider Threats, Implementing Guide, IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 8, 2008, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1359_web.pdf.\n Ibid.\n BBC News, “Sailor who murdered officer on submarine HMS Astute jailed for life”, 19 September 2011, http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14971198.\n E. Blandford and S. Sagan (eds.), Learning from a Disaster: Improving Nuclear Safety and Security After Fukushima, Stanford University Press, 2016, p. 65.\non understanding the consequences of such actions is fundamental to mitigating threats.\nInsider threat risks increase in significance in countries that are facing crises, including militant and terrorist attacks. Several physical attacks have occurred, for instance, in Pakistan's nuclear weapon bases. In the attempted coup in Turkey, power was cut off for several hours on and off for several days at the Incirlik airbase where the United States nuclear weapons are stationed. Although nuclear weapons bases are heavily guarded and physically protected, security challenges of today exceed the physical dimensions of protection and require cyber diligence. For instance, assessments of insider threat risks to computer systems have been carried out in other areas. By having easy access to computer systems, a person with malicious intent could steal data and information, including critical design information, operating information, and sensitive personnel data, and could sell this information to others—either to hostile governments or to non-state armed groups.\nA final \"insider\" threat scenario involves individuals beyond the facility. Due to lack of technical knowledge, sources and capacity, nuclear weapons States work with outside defence companies—in designing and building industrial control systems, for instance in a nuclear weapons base, or in submarine systems. Many work closely with the weapons complexes for decades and have stringent vetting procedures, but they may subcontract some of the work to other smaller companies that may not have the required procedures in place. This type of outsourcing can increase the likelihood of systems vulnerability. Routine performance and maintenance screening on nuclear weapons command and control systems conducted by outside companies, even in rare cases, are similar pathways for malware penetration in the systems.\n D. Nelson and T. Hussain, “Militants attack Pakistan nuclear air base”, *The Telegraph*, 16 August 2012, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9479041/Militants-attack-Pakistan-nuclear-air-base.html.\n J.

Ingram, “A primer on Trident’s vulnerabilities”, *Parliamentary Briefings on Trident Renewal Briefing No. 2*, BASIC, March 2016, http://www.basicint.org/sites/default/files/BASIC_cyber_vuln_mar2016.pdf.\n Outsourcing is common in information technology systems, but rare in information control systems.\n\nAscertaining the threats and vulnerabilities to the nuclear weapons systems from cyber attacks is vital in understanding the changing risk picture associated with nuclear weapons. The possessors of nuclear weapons, and those alliance countries that host them or otherwise incorporate them into their defence postures, need to be fully aware of the threats and risks posed to their citizens as well as to the populations of countries at which these weapons may be aimed.\nThe increasing number of cyber attacks in other domains, including on critical national and international infrastructures, suggests that the nuclear weapons establishments may face similar potential attacks. It may be that the technical measures taken to defend against such attacks, along with air gaps and rigorous training for cyber hygiene and protection, will be adequate to prevent those attacks from having any serious impacts. It is likely however that information theft will occur—such as names and addresses of personnel or facility layout and design—and the integrity and security of data could be compromised.\nWhat is needed then is an all-cyber-risks-based approach in nuclear weapons systems to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences against all critical assets. Today state capabilities are viewed as the biggest threats to a state's critical infrastructure; yet, the nature of vulnerability and evolution of technology will likely provide more opportunities for terrorist groups to conduct high-consequence incidents in the future. A graded approach to cyber security in nuclear weapons and systems complex calls for vulnerability assessment of each layer, including command and control systems, communication systems including satellites, space infrastructure, and targeting. It calls for the identification of critical components, assesses the likelihood of insider threat, and requires an efficient and timely reporting structure.\nPerhaps the single most significant impact of potential cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is that the certainty of information will be questioned. When Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov judged that he \"couldn't trust the computers\" and decided that the signals of incoming missiles from the United States to the Soviet Union at the height of tensions in 1983 were a false alarm, he was factoring in the uncertainty of the vulnerability of the technology on which he was supposed to rely. He was correct to do so. Former United States Defense Secretary William Perry's account of how a crisis-simulation training tape was left inadvertently in the computer at North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) leading the United States command to believe—for a short while—that 200 Soviet missiles were incoming\n P. Anthony (director), The Man Who Saved the World, documentary film, 2014, http://themanwhosavedtheworldmovie.com.\nillustrates one possible form a cyber attack could take. Possible cyber interference in the data, management, and operations of nuclear weapons systems increases the uncertainties in the decision-making. In a crisis, with little time to spare, how will these additional uncertainties play out? If the fundamental information cannot be trusted, how do the humans in charge make decisions?\n W.J.

These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons.

Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\nP.M. Lewis et al., *Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy*, Chatham House, 2014.\n² See National Threat Initiative, Project: Cyber-Nuclear Weapons Study Group, http://www.nti.org/about/projects/cyber-nuclear-weapons-study-group/.\n62\nNot all attacks on data are the same. While all data attacks are serious, some are far more serious than others. For example, information regarding personnel, nuclear facility layout, design and operational information, or specific tasks such as security personnel shifts are stored within computer-based information systems and could be susceptible to cyber attacks that lead to either high or low levels of consequence.³ Data exfiltration, denial of service attacks, and theft including cyber espionage are serious but, depending on the nature of the act, the information stolen, and when it was detected, need not necessarily lead to danger.⁴\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system ... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.⁵\n## The ubiquity of interconnectivity\nThe myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and\n³ A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n⁴ See A.

For instance, the United States is modernizing its integrated communications system (Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN)) to be able to have efficient and integrated nuclear systems—including \"facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel\"; this includes the crypto-interoperability of its critical management structure.¹⁰ Artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems (AI/RAS), are also revolutionizing the ways in which security is managed in the military nuclear sector. Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n⁶ J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12\nIn the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n11 A.

These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking. In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part. A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.\nMilitary strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems. Cyber attacks on satellites would undermine the\n D. Livingstone and P.

As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”.²¹ This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure.²² PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n¹⁹ NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

Because cyber technologies are within the grasp of most States and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.\nMany missile systems depend heavily on positional, navigational, and timing (PNT) data from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) operated by the United States, Russia, and Europe. They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight.²³ Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force.²⁴ In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours.²⁵ The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack. New GNSS satellite constellations—including regional and global systems from Europe and Asia—aim to reduce risks through increased resilience.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.\n²³ The Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM is equipped with an on-board GNSS receiver and more recent modifications of the Trident D5 ballistic missile include GNSS features as part of the otherwise self-contained on-board guidance system and includes a digital interface with the launch boat. Russia’s short-range Iskander missile employs an optical guidance warhead, by which the missile can be controlled by encrypted radio transmissions.\n²⁴ The GNSS networks currently available are the United States’ GPS, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), EGNOS and the new Galileo GNSS. China has developed a regional satellite navigation system, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and is now developing a GNSS (BeiDou-2) with the aim of global operation by 2020. India has a regional system NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation, formerly called IRNSS) and Japan is also developing a regional system, the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n²⁵ C. Baraniuk, “GPS error caused ‘12 hours of problems’ for companies”, BBC, 4 February 2016, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491962.\n68\n# Insider threats\nAnother understudied issue concerns insider threats in nuclear weapons facilities and platforms, nuclear bases in nuclear weapons States and host countries, and in nuclear weapons laboratories. Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority.²⁶ An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat.²⁷ Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine.²⁸ Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country. For instance, in Japan—a country under the nuclear weapons protection of the United States—personnel vetting systems for trustworthiness do not exist.²⁹ Establishing a security culture that builds\n---\n²⁶ IAEA, Preventive and Protective Measures against Insider Threats, Implementing Guide, IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 8, 2008, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1359_web.pdf.\n²⁷ Ibid.\n²⁸ BBC News, “Sailor who murdered officer on submarine HMS Astute jailed for life”, 19 September 2011, http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14971198.\n²⁹ E. Blandford and S. Sagan (eds.), Learning from a Disaster: Improving Nuclear Safety and Security After Fukushima, Stanford University Press, 2016, p. 65.\non understanding the consequences of such actions is fundamental to mitigating threats.\nInsider threat risks increase in significance in countries that are facing crises, including militant and terrorist attacks. Several physical attacks have occurred, for instance, in Pakistan's nuclear weapon bases.³⁰ In the attempted coup in Turkey, power was cut off for several hours on and off for several days at the Incirlik airbase where the United States nuclear weapons are stationed.³¹ Although nuclear weapons bases are heavily guarded and physically protected, security challenges of today exceed the physical dimensions of protection and require cyber diligence. For instance, assessments of insider threat risks to computer systems have been carried out in other areas.³² By having easy access to computer systems, a person with malicious intent could steal data and information, including critical design information, operating information, and sensitive personnel data, and could sell this information to others—either to hostile governments or to non-state armed groups.\nA final \"insider\" threat scenario involves individuals beyond the facility. Due to lack of technical knowledge, sources and capacity, nuclear weapons States work with outside defence companies—in designing and building industrial control systems, for instance in a nuclear weapons base, or in submarine systems.³³ Many work closely with the weapons complexes for decades and have stringent vetting procedures, but they may subcontract some of the work to other smaller companies that may not have the required procedures in place. This type of outsourcing can increase the likelihood of systems vulnerability. Routine performance and maintenance screening on nuclear weapons command and control systems conducted by outside companies, even in rare cases, are similar pathways for malware penetration in the systems.³⁴\n³⁰ D.

The possessors of nuclear weapons, and those alliance countries that host them or otherwise incorporate them into their defence postures, need to be fully aware of the threats and risks posed to their citizens as well as to the populations of countries at which these weapons may be aimed.\nThe increasing number of cyber attacks in other domains, including on critical national and international infrastructures, suggests that the nuclear weapons establishments may face similar potential attacks. It may be that the technical measures taken to defend against such attacks, along with air gaps and rigorous training for cyber hygiene and protection, will be adequate to prevent those attacks from having any serious impacts. It is likely however that information theft will occur—such as names and addresses of personnel or facility layout and design—and the integrity and security of data could be compromised.\nWhat is needed then is an all-cyber-risks-based approach in nuclear weapons systems to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences against all critical assets. Today state capabilities are viewed as the biggest threats to a state's critical infrastructure; yet, the nature of vulnerability and evolution of technology will likely provide more opportunities for terrorist groups to conduct high-consequence incidents in the future. A graded approach to cyber security in nuclear weapons and systems complex calls for vulnerability assessment of each layer, including command and control systems, communication systems including satellites, space infrastructure, and targeting. It calls for the identification of critical components, assesses the likelihood of insider threat, and requires an efficient and timely reporting structure.\nPerhaps the single most significant impact of potential cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is that the certainty of information will be questioned. When Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov judged that he \"couldn't trust the computers\" and decided that the signals of incoming missiles from the United States to the Soviet Union at the height of tensions in 1983 were a false alarm, he was factoring in the uncertainty of the vulnerability of the technology on which he was supposed to rely.³⁵ He was correct to do so. Former United States Defense Secretary William Perry's account of how a crisis-simulation training tape was left inadvertently in the computer at North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) leading the United States command to believe—for a short while—that 200 Soviet missiles were incoming\n³⁵ P. Anthony (director), The Man Who Saved the World, documentary film, 2014, http://themanwhosavedtheworldmovie.com.\nillustrates one possible form a cyber attack could take.³⁶ Possible cyber interference in the data, management, and operations of nuclear weapons systems increases the uncertainties in the decision-making. In a crisis, with little time to spare, how will these additional uncertainties play out? If the fundamental information cannot be trusted, how do the humans in charge make decisions?\n³⁶ W.J.

All digital technologies that receive, transmit, and manage digital data are potentially vulnerable to digital interference, which are called cyber attacks. These attacks range from data theft, to financial fraud, manipulation of data, or manipulation of machine instructions. Recent events and studies demonstrate how digital technologies are vulnerable to cyber attacks in many sectors, including energy production, shipping, space-based satellites, and financial transactions. Such attacks have the potential to wreak havoc either as part of a wider conflict or as one-off terror attacks.\nThe use of cyber attacks by a range of States aimed at disrupting and undermining institutional confidence, among other ambitions, is disrupting geopolitical stability. These activities have been evident in conflicts and domestic elections and there are deep concerns as to how they might play out in the event of crisis escalation to large-scale conflict or in doctrines regarding nuclear weapons. Many studies on these developments along with traditional thinking on strategic stability focus on the role of political resolve and \"red lines\". Less focus has been devoted to the role of technology in strategic stability and its impact on credibility and increasing uncertainty.\nIn the event of crisis escalation—such as over events in Ukraine, the Middle East, or Asia—the assumption is that weapons systems will perform as planned. But this is not a safe assumption. Any cyber interference with one or more parts of strategic weapons systems would undo the precarious balance of perceived deterrence and stability, and create confusion and uncertainty as to its origin, which could lead to inaccurate, inadequate, and hasty responses and the possibility of conventional and nuclear war.

Danzig, Surviving on a Diet of Poisoned Fruit: Reducing the National Security Risks of America’s Cyber Dependencies, Centre for a New American Security, July 2014, https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/CNAS_PoisonedFruit_Danzig.pdf; and\ntheir security planning, whether possessing their own nuclear weapons capabilities or through being part of a nuclear military alliance.\nThe cyber threat is one of the most important and yet under-considered concerns of our time.² If left unaddressed, cyber vulnerabilities of the strategic security infrastructure will result in severe consequences for national and international security.\n## Cyber technology vulnerabilities\nThe cyber vulnerable technologies in the nuclear weapons systems—both in the countries that possess them and in those where they are stationed—include:\n- communications between command and control centres;\n- communications from command stations to missile platforms (e.g. submarines) and missiles;\n- telemetry data from missiles to ground- and space-based command and control assets;\n- analytical centres for gathering and interpreting long-term and real-time intelligence;\n- cyber technologies in transport;\n- cyber technologies in laboratories and assembly facilities;\n- pre-launch targeting information for upload;\n- real-time targeting information from space-based systems including positional, navigational, and timing data from global navigational systems;\n- real-time weather information from space-, air-, and ground-based sensors;\n- positioning data for launch platforms (e.g. submarines);\n- real-time targeting information from ground stations;\n- communications between allied command centres; and\n- robotic autonomous systems within the strategic infrastructure.\n## Differential impacts\nCyber vulnerability in nuclear weapons systems is all about connectivity and data integrity. Reliable, trustworthy, and accurate data is vital for targeting, command, and control. The security of data and the security of channels that transmit and receive that data are therefore critical for the reliability of all modern nuclear and conventional weapons systems.\nP.M. Lewis et al., *Too Close for Comfort: Cases of Near Nuclear Use and Options for Policy*, Chatham House, 2014.\n² See National Threat Initiative, Project: Cyber-Nuclear Weapons Study Group, http://www.nti.org/about/projects/cyber-nuclear-weapons-study-group/.\n\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) including supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), on the other hand, are a critical part of a fully functioning command, control, and communications in the nuclear systems design. These systems relay real-time data and messages from sensors to central locations including to and from satellites and ground stations. Advanced targeted threats to ICS could “reprogram an industrial control system... commanding it to operate at unsafe speed or the valves to open when they should remain closed”.⁵ ## The ubiquity of interconnectivity The myth that nuclear facilities and platforms are air-gapped—meaning they are not connected to the Internet—is gradually decreasing as nuclear establishments are increasingly informed about cyber threats. Yet, academic and policy analysis on nuclear weapons facilities and nuclear command and control systems is still in its infancy, due to the secrecy surrounding nuclear weapons systems and the under-investment in research into potential problems until recently.\nVirtual private networks and hidden supply chain connections are entry points for cyber vulnerabilities in any network. Other areas may include “privilege escalation, roaming notebooks, wireless access points, embedded exploits in software and ³ A United States Department of Defense Task Force report concluded that “the cyber threat is serious and that the United States cannot be confident that [its] critical Information Technology systems will work under attack from a sophisticated and well-resourced opponent.” See Defense Science Board, The United States Department of Defense, Military Cyber Attacks and America’s Vulnerable Nuclear Weapons and Defenses: DoD Task Force Report on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber Threat, January 2013.\n⁴ See A.

For instance, the United States is modernizing its integrated communications system (Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN)) to be able to have efficient and integrated nuclear systems—including\"facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel\"; this includes the crypto-interoperability of its critical management structure.¹⁰ Artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous systems (AI/RAS), are also revolutionizing the ways in which security is managed in the military nuclear sector. Russia is field-testing robots to guard strategic forces, perform reconnaissance and even launch ballistic missiles. China has made significant advances in quantum communications, which will open up new pathways for AI/RAS.\n⁶ J.

AI/RAS systems cannot yet incorporate all the elements pertaining to security that are significant and important to humans and in-built misjudgement in these early systems may result in unforeseen consequences.12 In the past, ballistic missile defence systems required a physical presence, a human-in-the-loop, aiming to intercept a target after it had been launched. Today, the systems are semi-autonomous, relying on radar and missile technologies and transmitting data to ground stations. But missile defence is entering a new phase, which is to “disable missiles before launch” including through cyber means—requiring an earlier infiltration of the adversary’s network. The United States calls this “left of launch” capability, a non-kinetic and less costly approach to missiles defence.13 The introduction of cyber capabilities for missile defence is likely eventually to create competition among nuclear weapons States and have a negative impact on strategic stability in what is already a highly divisive debate.14 For example, the Russian government has an established view against traditional ballistic missile defence in Eastern Europe, calling it a “direct threat” to its national security.15 A cyber version of this threat would be viewed with equal concern but indeed may be a far more destabilizing development.\n\nThe vulnerability of space assets and space-based technologies to cyber attack could undermine the safety, reliability, and credibility of nuclear and conventional weapons systems. These include missile defences, high-precision semi-autonomous weapons such as drones and all manner of strategic communications and space-based command and control systems in all nuclear weapons possessors. As military situational awareness, observation, and connectivity rely heavily on space-based satellites and are wholly dependent on cyber technologies, vulnerabilities in those systems pose enormous risks with regard to misjudged and irreversible missile launch and thus—particularly in times of heightened tensions—regional or even global war.\nCyber attacks range from jamming, spoofing, data interception, corruption and falsification, deliberate orbit decay, deliberate collisions, grilling (frying of solar panels by turning them to the sun), to full-on system hijacking. In the event of the escalation of an international crisis, cyber vulnerabilities could be exploited as part of diplomatic, civil domestic or military campaigns. Recent research has identified critical satellite vulnerabilities to cyber hacking.[16] In 2014, a cyber attack on a United States weather satellite system brought home the very real danger of cyber vulnerabilities in strategic space-based assets for much of the United States and its allies' strategic infrastructure, of which weather monitoring satellites are a vital part.[17] A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Landsat-7 Earth observation satellite was subject to cyber interference in October 2007 and July 2008 and other similar cyber attacks on a NASA Terra AM-1 Earth observation satellite occurred in June 2008 and October 2008.[18] Military strategic and tactical missile systems rely on satellites and the space infrastructure for navigation and targeting, command and control, operational monitoring and other functions. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the increasing vulnerability of space-based assets, ground stations, and associated command and control systems. Cyber attacks on satellites would undermine the [16] D. Livingstone and P.

As far back as 1997, the President’s Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection stated that “the most significant projected vulnerabilities are those associated with the modernization of the National Airspace System (NAS) and the plan to adopt the Global Positioning System (GPS) as the sole basis for radio-navigation in the US by 2010” and that “exclusive reliance on GPS and its augmentations, combined with other complex interdependencies, raises the potential for ‘single point failure’ and ‘cascading effects’”.²¹ This analysis led to a thorough investigation of the threats and vulnerabilities associated with GPS deployment, and to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, which laid out the roles, responsibilities and objectives associated with protecting utility, transportation, financial and other critical infrastructure.²² PDD-63 focused on cooperation and intelligence-sharing among government agencies and with the private sector, and protecting individual sectors such as energy, banking and transport.\n¹⁹ NOAA, Significant Security Deficiencies in NOAA’s Information Systems Create Risks in Its National Critical Mission, United States Department of Commerce, 15 July 2014, https://www.oig.doc.gov/OIGPublications/OIG-14-025-A.pdf; R.

Obama, Executive Order-Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, The White House, 12 February 2013, integrity of strategic weapons systems, destabilize deterrence relationships, and obfuscate the originator of the attack without creating the debris problem that a physical attack would cause. Because cyber technologies are within the grasp of most States and non-state actors, they level the strategic field and create hitherto unparalleled opportunities for small belligerent governments or terrorist groups to instigate high-impact attacks.\nMany missile systems depend heavily on positional, navigational, and timing (PNT) data from global navigational satellite systems (GNSS) operated by the United States, Russia, and Europe. They depend on these systems for initial position of the launch platform such as a submarine, or for additional information for guidance in-flight.²³ Until recently much of the international system has been highly dependent on the GPS satellite network managed by the United States Air Force.²⁴ In 2016, as a result of a glitch in ground-system software that occurred when a satellite was being decommissioned, 15 GPS satellites broadcast signals that were inaccurate by 13 microseconds, and telecommunications suffered thousands of system errors over 12 hours.²⁵ The incident revealed the significant impact of the satellite system’s vulnerabilities to software error and thus to a cyber hack. New GNSS satellite constellations—including regional and global systems from Europe and Asia—aim to reduce risks through increased resilience.\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity.\n²³ The Russian RT-2PM2 Topol-M ICBM is equipped with an on-board GNSS receiver and more recent modifications of the Trident D5 ballistic missile include GNSS features as part of the otherwise self-contained on-board guidance system and includes a digital interface with the launch boat. Russia’s short-range Iskander missile employs an optical guidance warhead, by which the missile can be controlled by encrypted radio transmissions.\n²⁴ The GNSS networks currently available are the United States’ GPS, Russia’s Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS), EGNOS and the new Galileo GNSS. China has developed a regional satellite navigation system, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), and is now developing a GNSS (BeiDou-2) with the aim of global operation by 2020. India has a regional system NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation, formerly called IRNSS) and Japan is also developing a regional system, the Quazi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n²⁵ C. Baraniuk, “GPS error caused ‘12 hours of problems’ for companies”, BBC, 4 February 2016, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491962.\n\nAnother understudied issue concerns insider threats in nuclear weapons facilities and platforms, nuclear bases in nuclear weapons States and host countries, and in nuclear weapons laboratories. Insiders possess knowledge of how to access nuclear facilities, penetrate nuclear systems, equipment or tools; they have knowledge of facility layout structures or processes, physical protection, safety systems, personnel, and other sensitive information; they often possess technical experience and expertise; and they have the ability to acquire equipment in order to conduct malicious activities. They may also be highly trusted and in positions of authority.²⁶ An insider threat does not always have malign intent. Simple human error and poor practice, including poor cyber security practice, may also lead to high consequences. Increasing situational awareness and training is important to limit errors.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) offers guidance on the preventive and protective measures against insider threats in the nuclear industry; yet, there is a lack of an international framework for implementing the mitigation of insider threat.²⁷ Instead, it is the responsibility of countries to provide prevention measures. The aviation sector provides an effective comparison, as airport personnel are not always held to the same stringent security screening standards as the passengers. A similar type of negligence exists in the nuclear industry, and perhaps even to a higher degree. Psychological screening of the personnel in nuclear submarines, for instance, is an area of high concern. In 2011, a United Kingdom sailor “shot a senior officer on board” a nuclear submarine.²⁸ Personnel reliability programmes may also fall short in cases where personnel chose to cheat on the test or memorize the questions rather than perform.\nWhile examining insider threats, it is important to understand the influence of different security cultures. In organizations with a strong community feeling, threat is generally perceived as an outside phenomenon. Reporting suspicious behaviour of a colleague in these cultures is akin to the betrayal of one another. Similarly, there are organizational differences from country to country. For instance, in Japan—a country under the nuclear weapons protection of the United States—personnel vetting systems for trustworthiness do not exist.²⁹ Establishing a security culture that builds --- ²⁶ IAEA, Preventive and Protective Measures against Insider Threats, Implementing Guide, IAEA Nuclear Security Series No. 8, 2008, http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1359_web.pdf.\n²⁷ Ibid.\n²⁸ BBC News, “Sailor who murdered officer on submarine HMS Astute jailed for life”, 19 September 2011, http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-14971198.\n²⁹ E. Blandford and S. Sagan (eds.), Learning from a Disaster: Improving Nuclear Safety and Security After Fukushima, Stanford University Press, 2016, p. 65.\non understanding the consequences of such actions is fundamental to mitigating threats.\nInsider threat risks increase in significance in countries that are facing crises, including militant and terrorist attacks. Several physical attacks have occurred, for instance, in Pakistan's nuclear weapon bases.³⁰ In the attempted coup in Turkey, power was cut off for several hours on and off for several days at the Incirlik airbase where the United States nuclear weapons are stationed.³¹ Although nuclear weapons bases are heavily guarded and physically protected, security challenges of today exceed the physical dimensions of protection and require cyber diligence. For instance, assessments of insider threat risks to computer systems have been carried out in other areas.³² By having easy access to computer systems, a person with malicious intent could steal data and information, including critical design information, operating information, and sensitive personnel data, and could sell this information to others—either to hostile governments or to non-state armed groups.\nA final\"insider\"threat scenario involves individuals beyond the facility. Due to lack of technical knowledge, sources and capacity, nuclear weapons States work with outside defence companies—in designing and building industrial control systems, for instance in a nuclear weapons base, or in submarine systems.³³ Many work closely with the weapons complexes for decades and have stringent vetting procedures, but they may subcontract some of the work to other smaller companies that may not have the required procedures in place. This type of outsourcing can increase the likelihood of systems vulnerability. Routine performance and maintenance screening on nuclear weapons command and control systems conducted by outside companies, even in rare cases, are similar pathways for malware penetration in the systems.³⁴ ³⁰ D. Nelson and T. Hussain, “Militants attack Pakistan nuclear air base”, *The Telegraph*, 16 August 2012, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9479041/Militants-attack-Pakistan-nuclear-air-base.html.\n³¹ J. Lewis and K.

Ingram, “A primer on Trident’s vulnerabilities”, *Parliamentary Briefings on Trident Renewal Briefing No. 2*, BASIC, March 2016, http://www.basicint.org/sites/default/files/BASIC_cyber_vuln_mar2016.pdf.\n³⁴ Outsourcing is common in information technology systems, but rare in information control systems.\n\nAscertaining the threats and vulnerabilities to the nuclear weapons systems from cyber attacks is vital in understanding the changing risk picture associated with nuclear weapons. The possessors of nuclear weapons, and those alliance countries that host them or otherwise incorporate them into their defence postures, need to be fully aware of the threats and risks posed to their citizens as well as to the populations of countries at which these weapons may be aimed.\nThe increasing number of cyber attacks in other domains, including on critical national and international infrastructures, suggests that the nuclear weapons establishments may face similar potential attacks. It may be that the technical measures taken to defend against such attacks, along with air gaps and rigorous training for cyber hygiene and protection, will be adequate to prevent those attacks from having any serious impacts. It is likely however that information theft will occur—such as names and addresses of personnel or facility layout and design—and the integrity and security of data could be compromised.\nWhat is needed then is an all-cyber-risks-based approach in nuclear weapons systems to assess threats, vulnerabilities and consequences against all critical assets. Today state capabilities are viewed as the biggest threats to a state's critical infrastructure; yet, the nature of vulnerability and evolution of technology will likely provide more opportunities for terrorist groups to conduct high-consequence incidents in the future. A graded approach to cyber security in nuclear weapons and systems complex calls for vulnerability assessment of each layer, including command and control systems, communication systems including satellites, space infrastructure, and targeting. It calls for the identification of critical components, assesses the likelihood of insider threat, and requires an efficient and timely reporting structure.\nPerhaps the single most significant impact of potential cyber attacks on nuclear weapons systems is that the certainty of information will be questioned. When Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov judged that he\"couldn't trust the computers\"and decided that the signals of incoming missiles from the United States to the Soviet Union at the height of tensions in 1983 were a false alarm, he was factoring in the uncertainty of the vulnerability of the technology on which he was supposed to rely.³⁵ He was correct to do so. Former United States Defense Secretary William Perry's account of how a crisis-simulation training tape was left inadvertently in the computer at North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) leading the United States command to believe—for a short while—that 200 Soviet missiles were incoming ³⁵ P. Anthony (director), The Man Who Saved the World, documentary film, 2014, http://themanwhosavedtheworldmovie.com.\nillustrates one possible form a cyber attack could take.³⁶ Possible cyber interference in the data, management, and operations of nuclear weapons systems increases the uncertainties in the decision-making. In a crisis, with little time to spare, how will these additional uncertainties play out? If the fundamental information cannot be trusted, how do the humans in charge make decisions?\n³⁶ W.J.
