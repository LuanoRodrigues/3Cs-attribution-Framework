TERRY*\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections. . . . If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves. . . .¹\nFollowing the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, there has been noticeable interest in the lawfulness of foreign interference in another state's elections under public international law. The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n* Patrick C.

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵\nWhy, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n3. DOV H. LEVIN, MEDDLING IN THE BALLOT BOX: THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF PARTISAN ELECTORAL INTERVENTIONS 4 (2020).\n4. See id. at 3, 50, 158–60. For his research, Levin classified the following activities as “intervention”: “[p]rovision of campaign funds,” “[p]ublic and specific threats,” “[t]raining locals . . . in advanced campaigning,” “[d]issemination of scandalous exposés/disinformation,” “[d]esigning . . . of campaigning materials,” “[s]udden . . . provision of foreign aid or a significant increase,” and “[w]ithdrawal of part or whole of aid.” Id. at 51. On the other hand, he excluded activities such as “refusal . . . to publicly meet with a candidate” or “[p]ositive/negative things said about a candidate” and “[l]eaks to the press of reports of disagreements” from his analysis.

Unsurprisingly, therefore, the CIA, in 1969/1970, also concluded that its “Elections Operations” were successful: “There have been numerous instances when, facing the threat of the Communist Party or popular front election victory [in the Free World], we have met the threat and turned it successfully.” U.S. Dep’t of State, Memorandum from the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs (Kissinger) to President Nixon, Tab A, in 12 FOREIGN RELATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES 1969-1976, at 464 (Erin R.

This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸\nThe analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰\n⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\nSecondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or\ncomplexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73\norganization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often\n11. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES\nRussia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14]\nIn this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the\n13. OHLIN, supra note 10, at 91, 97-104.\n14.

In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10\n15.

In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57\n## Further Examples\nAs these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US \"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to \"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this, \"the CIA mounted a massive [. . . ]\n56.

Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States \"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\" the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely \"acquiesc[ed]\" to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79]\nIn 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA \"leaked damaging information\" claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83]\nRole of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n76.

The US government seemed to believe that the deeply unpopular Yeltsin⁸⁷ was the only democratic candidate and that it was necessary to prevent the victory of the Communist Party candidate.⁸⁸ In a highly critical report, the Speaker's Special Advisory Group on Russia concluded in 2000 that the US government had \"pressur[ed]\" the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \"to grant $10.2 billion in credits to Russia\" and had thereby \"effectively used the Fund . . . to subsidize Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign.\"⁸⁹ Furthermore, US spin-doctors flew into Moscow to support Boris Yeltsin's campaign.⁹⁰ According to some reports, their work was decisive in securing his eventual victory.⁹¹ How closely these advisors were connected to the US government remains unclear.⁹²\nDuring the 2011 parliamentary election campaign, the Russian government accused the US of interference in order to undermine\n84.

Allegedly, the US government paid NGOs in Russia to discredit the Russian electoral process even before the election had taken place.⁹³ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned such activities and declared: \"When financing comes to some domestic organizations which are supposedly national, but which in fact work on foreign money and perform to the music of a foreign state during electoral processes, we need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs and defend our sovereignty.\"⁹⁴ Vladimir Putin subsequently also accused the United States of instigating the protests that erupted following the elections, during which claims of electoral fraud were made.⁹⁵\nPast US activities therefore may help explain US President Barack Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"⁹⁶ Although the statement fell short of an explicit condemnation of Russia's conduct as unlawful,⁹⁷ it does at the same time also leave some room for interpreting the US stance in such a way.⁹⁸\nRussia, too, has been accused of meddling in other states' elections on numerous other occasions—for example, in the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016⁹⁹ and its general election in 2019.¹⁰⁰ While the pro-Brexit UK government has so far refused to investigate claims that Russia interfered during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign in favor of the \"Leave\" campaign,¹⁰¹ many others agree that such Russian\n⁹³.

Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷\nThus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted . . .\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

Rather, the intervenor must employ \"methods of coercion\" to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To \"persuade\" has been defined as \"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴\nHowever, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term \"coercion\" in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to \"methods of coercion\" severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited\n138.

There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible.

In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This\n157.

This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This\n165.

Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵\nFor an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹\n172.

It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law. In order to reach a definitive verdict, however, it also needs to be ascertained that the intervening state was not acting within its rights under public international law when resorting to coercion.\n## Prohibited interventions in other states' elections\n\"In addition, I would be in favor of legislation prohibiting interference with the electoral processes in other countries.\"¹⁸¹\nCyrus Vance thus expressed his wish for US legislation outlawing foreign election meddling. The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared:\nIncontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law. . . .\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for\n180.

Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³\n## Deception and Manipulation\nSuch interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in\n188.

The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰\nIf the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore\n195.

A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations.

The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹\nWhat remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n208.

If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications\nThe possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵\nIrrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the\nCyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk,\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103\nrejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared:\nIt [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention[233]. . . The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.[234]\n## Economic Measures\nNevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful.

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic\n235. See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 28–29; but see Helal, supra note 10, at 81–82 (stating such economic measures are not coercive as long as they are not combined with other, unlawful measures in order to achieve the intervenor’s goals).\n236. See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 29–30; Watts, supra note 10, at 12–13; but see Helal, supra note 10, at 7, 62–64, 81–84, 85–86. In Helal’s view, withdrawing or granting benefits in order to achieve a specific election result –though generally lawful– becomes unlawful, if such actions are combined with other unlawful means. He views such a strategy as a composite breach of the non-intervention rule. Less convincingly, he argues that such economic measures merely amount to “persuasion” if not combined with unlawful means. Helal, supra note 10, at 81. For example, Helal views the hacking of the emails circulating among the leadership of Democratic Party and their subsequent publication in order to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election as unlawful. Had Russia at the same time threatened to impose sanctions on the United States, these sanctions would have therefore been rendered unlawful. Had Russia, on the other hand, only threatened the United States with the imposition of sanctions in the case of a Clinton victory, that, in his view, would have been lawful. A potentially extremely coercive measure’s legality (imposition of sanctions) would thus depend on whether the intervenor resorted to other, potentially minor, but unlawful means of intervention, which is not convincing. See also Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention on the Internal Affairs of States, UN GA Res. 36/103 (1981), op. para. II (k). However, it is very doubtful that the resolution reflected customary international law, as many western states opposed the resolution. See Jamnejad, Wood, supra note 138, at 355 n.32.\n237.

Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016\nApplied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\nthe efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY\nIntervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of \"sovereignty\" as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty: \"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a\n240.

In the speech, the U.K. Attorney General stated the following: “Sovereignty is of course fundamental to the international rules-based system. But I am not persuaded that we can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention.

Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰\nIn summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty.

According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³\nThis line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸\nAlthough the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an\n262.

Ohlin does not explore what the term \"democracy\" means in public international law. Is a state a democracy simply because there are competing parties and voters are permitted to cast ballots?²⁷⁶ Developments in states such as Iraq, Libya,\n270.

However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it does not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domain réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses. See also Van de Velde, supra note 10, at 15.\n272.

Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵\nand bishops of the Church of England).

See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 37–45. However, Damrosch argues that interfering in other states’ political processes may be justified if the target state does not allow for meaningful participation on the part of its citizens. She only wants to exclude target states from the prohibition of interventions that evidence a “serious pattern of violation of political human rights,” while emphasizing that “[w]estern-style pluralist democracy is only one of a variety of models that states may employ to give their citizens a voice in government . . .” Limiting international law’s protection to “democratic” states, on the other hand, may well lead to a “disagreement . . . over the specific modalities of political participation. Such disagreements could concern many issues of philosophy and practice – for example, single member districts versus at-large election, runoffs, proportional representation of minority parties . . .” possibly offering an intervenor many arguments in order to justify excluding a specific (target) state from its own understanding of democracy.\n284.

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n## CONCLUSION\nThis article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions\n286.

The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³\nHowever, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters\n289.

Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication,\n²⁹⁴.

However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117\nseems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or \"democratic\" exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domaine réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses. See also Van de Velde, supra note 10, at 15.\n298.

The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n* Patrick C. R. Terry is the Dean of the Faculty of Law and a Professor of Law at the University of Public Administration in Kehl (Germany).

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵ Why, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71 In order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸ The analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰ ⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 Secondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or complexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73 organization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 election meddling will also result in a violation of another state's sovereignty. However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW75 former intervention that was more intrusive and likely more successful.\n## US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 The Italian parliamentary election of 1948 was an early milestone in foreign election meddling. In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10 INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 million.²² Such generosity enabled the anti-Communist parties to spend 7.5 times more on the election campaign than the Communists.²³ This generosity was accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign that highlighted Soviet activities in Eastern Europe.²⁴ Pamphlets were produced that targeted Communist politicians' personal lives.²⁵ Letters allegedly from members of the Communist Party were forged and published widely.²⁶ Voice of America regularly broadcast US propaganda, as did various commercial radio stations with the support of the US State Department.²⁷ A massive letter-writing campaign was organized whereby Americans of Italian extraction were encouraged to write to their relatives in Italy to discourage them from voting for the Communists. At first written by Italian Americans themselves, these letters were soon mass-produced and only required an address and a signature.²⁸ Around ten million of such letters were sent to Italy.²⁹ On the other hand, the United States publicly threatened to reduce or stop any economic assistance should the Communists be elected, while promising to increase such aid in the event of the emergence of a government excluding the Communist Party.³⁰ Furthermore, the United States threatened to bar all Italians who were members of the Communist Party from entering the United States.³¹ There was some British assistance in support of US election interference.³² In the British Embassy in Rome, a committee was formed to organize covert election meddling.³³ To guarantee more favorable https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=1&amp;year=1948 (last visited Jan. 29, 2022) (calculating that $1 in 1948 equals around $11.13 in 2021).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW77 reporting in Italian newspapers, journalists were bribed.³⁴ Unattributable papers were distributed to influence the electorate.³⁵ The greatest British triumph probably was the creation of the popular Don Camillo and Peppone series about a Communist mayor and a Catholic priest.³⁶ Nevertheless, due to financial restraints, the British effort was minor in comparison to US involvement.³⁷ US intervention in Italy might have become much more far-reaching had the Communists won the election. In some circles within the US government, there were debates on whether to intervene militarily or support a coup carried out by Italian military forces should the Communist Party emerge victorious from the elections.³⁸ In the end, the party supported by the United States, the Christian Democrats, won the 1948 parliamentary elections.³⁹ This was mainly or at least partly due, many believe, to the United States' massive involvement in the election campaign.⁴⁰ ## Russian intervention in the U.S. election of 2016 In early 2016, the Russian government and figures associated with the Russian government began to prepare their campaign of interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. The aim of Russian meddling was to help defeat the Democratic Party candidate, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—who was perceived as being very critical of the Russian government—and to support the election of the Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump.⁴¹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 According to US authorities, Russia also sought to sow discord among Americans⁴² and to generally undermine public trust in the US electoral process and system of government.⁴³ To achieve this, the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), which according to the US government was “tasked” to do this by the Russian government,⁴⁴ bought advertisements supportive of Trump, or his policies, on social media sites, such as Facebook.⁴⁵ Moreover, in order to achieve its goal, fictitious Facebook,⁴⁶ Instagram,⁴⁷ and Twitter accounts were created.⁴⁸ Overall, the IRA was responsible for more than 61,500 posts on Facebook, more than 116,000 posts on Instagram, and more than 10.4 million tweets on Twitter.⁴⁹ In all of these instances, the IRA’s authorship was not acknowledged. Rather, the aim was to create the impression that these were messages posted by US citizens.⁵⁰ According to one estimate, the Russian-inspired Facebook posts reached 126 million users.⁵¹ Many of these posts were also successful in instigating actual US citizens to take further action, such as forwarding the posts to acquaintances.⁵² The IRA also used its social media presence to promote Trump rallies.⁵³ In addition, Russian news sites and television channels, such as RT and Sputnik, regularly broadcast material that was supportive of Trump and critical of Clinton.⁵⁴ Furthermore, Russia initiated the hacking of email accounts of persons in the Democratic Party leadership who were associated with Hillary Clinton.⁵⁵ These emails, which were damaging to the Clinton campaign, were subsequently published by WikiLeaks, allegedly in note 10, at 186.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW79 cooperation with Russian government circles.56 As is well known, the candidate the Russian government supported, Donald Trump, was victorious in the 2016 presidential election. In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57 ## Further Examples As these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US\"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to\"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this,\"the CIA mounted a massive [... ] INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 propaganda campaign\"62 that in the end resulted in\"24 daily newscasts in Santiago and the provinces, 26 weekly 'commentary' programs, and... 3,000 posters daily.\"63 The CIA concluded that this campaign was decisive in securing a majority for the favored candidate, Eduardo Frei.64 The United States also intervened in the congressional elections of 1965 and 1969 by providing campaign funding and producing propaganda.65 In 1965, nine of the twenty-two candidates supported by the CIA were elected;66 in 1969, ten of twelve.67 The Senate Report concludes that these CIA efforts were\"relatively successful\"and produced a\"substantial cumulative effect over these years.\"68 During the election campaign for the presidential election in 1970, the United States again interfered on a grand scale: although there was hardly any direct funding of political parties,69 the CIA once more launched a\"massive propaganda campaign.\"70 This included\"black propaganda\"in order to undermine the leftist coalition, a\"newsletter\"sent to\"journalists, academicians, politicians,\"and editorials, as well as radio broadcasts.71 In this instance, however, US involvement could not prevent the leftist candidate, Salvador Allende, from winning a plurality in the election.72 Subsequently, the United States unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Chile's Congress from confirming Salvador Allende as President.73 Political statements to that effect were issued, a new propaganda campaign was launched, economic pressure was exerted, and signals were given to military officers and others that a coup would be acceptable to the United States.74 The US also intervened in other Latin American elections, mainly in the 1980s and 1990s.75 Two examples are the 1982 election in El MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW81 Salvador and the 1990 election in Nicaragua. Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States\"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\"the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely\"acquiesc[ed]\"to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79] In 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA\"leaked damaging information\"claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83] Role of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 The United States' preferred candidate won.\nMore recently, the United States has been accused of interfering in Russia's presidential election of 1996⁸⁴ and the parliamentary election of 2011.⁸⁵ Dov Levin has described US interference in Russia's 1996 presidential election in favor of Boris Yeltsin as\"one of the most massive electoral interventions recorded in [his] dataset,\"⁸⁶ which covers the period from 1946 to 2000. The US government seemed to believe that the deeply unpopular Yeltsin⁸⁷ was the only democratic candidate and that it was necessary to prevent the victory of the Communist Party candidate.⁸⁸ In a highly critical report, the Speaker's Special Advisory Group on Russia concluded in 2000 that the US government had\"pressur[ed]\"the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\"to grant $10.2 billion in credits to Russia\"and had thereby\"effectively used the Fund... to subsidize Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign.\"⁸⁹ Furthermore, US spin-doctors flew into Moscow to support Boris Yeltsin's campaign.⁹⁰ According to some reports, their work was decisive in securing his eventual victory.⁹¹ How closely these advisors were connected to the US government remains unclear.⁹² During the 2011 parliamentary election campaign, the Russian government accused the US of interference in order to undermine MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW83 Russia's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Allegedly, the US government paid NGOs in Russia to discredit the Russian electoral process even before the election had taken place.⁹³ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned such activities and declared:\"When financing comes to some domestic organizations which are supposedly national, but which in fact work on foreign money and perform to the music of a foreign state during electoral processes, we need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs and defend our sovereignty.\"⁹⁴ Vladimir Putin subsequently also accused the United States of instigating the protests that erupted following the elections, during which claims of electoral fraud were made.⁹⁵ Past US activities therefore may help explain US President Barack Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"⁹⁶ Although the statement fell short of an explicit condemnation of Russia's conduct as unlawful,⁹⁷ it does at the same time also leave some room for interpreting the US stance in such a way.⁹⁸ Russia, too, has been accused of meddling in other states' elections on numerous other occasions—for example, in the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016⁹⁹ and its general election in 2019.¹⁰⁰ While the pro-Brexit UK government has so far refused to investigate claims that Russia interfered during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign in favor of the\"Leave\"campaign,¹⁰¹ many others agree that such Russian ⁹³.

In doing so, President Biden emphasized that elections were “sovereign undertakings,” as well as an “expression of the will of the American people.” Therefore, the United States could not “allow a foreign power to interfere in our... democratic process with impunity.”¹²⁴ Whether it is, nevertheless, possible to justify election meddling under public international law is the issue I will be turning to in the next chapter.\nPropaganda-Attacke auf Baerbock [Interior Ministry Warns of Russian Propaganda Attack on Baerbock], SPIEGEL ONLINE (June 18, 2021, 6:32 PM), https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/annalena-baerbock-bundesinnenministerium-warnt-vor-russischer-propaganda-attacke-a-fd0f6408-6e78-45d9-998a-bd1cedcf3089 (Ger.); Putin-Kampagne Gegen Baerbock: 'Läuft auf eine neue Phase des Kalten Kriegs hinaus' [Putin’s Campaign Against Baerbock: 'Heads for a new phase of the Cold War'], MERKUR (May 19, 2021), https://www.merkur.de/politik/bundestagswahl-annalena-baerbock-wladimir-putin-russland-gruene-90612737.html (Ger.).\n¹¹⁹.

Evans ed., 5th ed. 2018).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 confirmed that the Friendly Relations Resolution was “declaratory of customary international law.”¹³³ The ICJ itself had previously stressed the legal quality of the prohibition of such interventions: already in 1949, it declared interventions in other states’ affairs to be unlawful.¹³⁴ The prohibition on interventions in the internal or external affairs of another state therefore qualifies as a rule of customary international law.¹³⁵ The ICJ’s 1986 judgment in the Nicaragua case is frequently cited when discussing the prohibition of interventions because the court provided a partial definition of the prohibition’s scope. Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention: A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷ Thus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted...\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

Rather, the intervenor must employ\"methods of coercion\"to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To\"persuade\"has been defined as\"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴ However, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term\"coercion\"in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to\"methods of coercion\"severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 when the level of coercion is comparable to the threat to use force.¹⁴⁸ The inaccuracy of this view becomes obvious when some claim that coercive intervention must be “dictatorial” in nature, leaving the target state with no room for maneuver,¹⁴⁹ and that coercion requires the target state to be fully aware of its being coerced.¹⁵⁰ This very limited view of prohibited interventions is unconvincing.¹⁵¹ When partially defining the term “nonintervention,” the ICJ stressed it was only looking at “those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant” to the case before it.¹⁵² The court was dealing with the United States’ massive support of the Nicaraguan rebels, the Contras, who were attempting to overthrow their country’s government by force. There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible. Rather, the difference between coercive intervention and permissible persuasion comes down to whether the target state retains its freedom to choose in matters related to its independence as a state.¹⁵⁶ supra note 138 (offering a general discussion of the difficulty of distinguishing between acceptable “persuasion” of another state and unlawful “coercion”).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW91 Thus, an intervention is unlawful when the aim is to deprive the target state of its discretion to decide freely on issues related to its internal or external affairs.¹⁵⁷ As DeWitt Dickinson indicated in 1920, intervention is prohibited when it “cannot be terminated at the pleasure of the state that is subject to the intervention.”¹⁵⁸ Coercion, thus, merely requires that the target state is unable to respond to the outside interference and is therefore forced to tolerate it, irrespective of whether this tolerance is due to inability or lack of awareness. In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 excludes from the prohibition all activities by the intervening state of which the target state is not aware. This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW93 argument is similarly unconvincing. Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵ For an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 In summary, intervention is usually unlawful when a state is targeting the internal affairs of another state and thereby employing methods that the target state cannot\"terminate at its pleasure\"¹⁸⁰ and therefore are coercive. It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law. In order to reach a definitive verdict, however, it also needs to be ascertained that the intervening state was not acting within its rights under public international law when resorting to coercion.\n## Prohibited interventions in other states' elections\"In addition, I would be in favor of legislation prohibiting interference with the electoral processes in other countries.\"¹⁸¹ Cyrus Vance thus expressed his wish for US legislation outlawing foreign election meddling. The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared: Incontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law....\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW95 the purpose of influencing American public opinion on a political question.¹⁸³ Elections determine a people’s “choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy,” a decision which, according to the ICJ, must remain free.¹⁸⁴ There is, therefore, widespread agreement that a state’s electoral process is a matter within a state’s *domaine réservé* and is protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁸⁵ This protection is confirmed by numerous General Assembly resolutions that have stated that: [A]ny activities that attempt, directly or indirectly, to interfere in the free development of national electoral processes, in particular in the developing countries, or that are intended to sway the results of such processes, violate the spirit and letter of the principles established in the Charter and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.¹⁸⁶ Furthermore, the fact that intervenors often seem to succeed in influencing target-state election results,¹⁸⁷ thereby securing for themselves a say in choosing a target state’s government, renders any contrary arguments unconvincing. As Ray Meyer has pointed out, such an intervention, if successful, can result in “an inherently more extensive intervention in internal affairs because it may involve an indirect intervention in all future policy decisions made by the tainted INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 government.”¹⁸⁸ ## Persuasion Accordingly, the main emphasis of legal analysis must focus on whether the intervenor employed coercive means in order to achieve the desired election result.¹⁸⁹ As indicated earlier, the attempt by one state to persuade another state’s electorate to vote in a specific way is lawful under public international law.¹⁹⁰ What differentiates lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is the decision on the part of the meddling state, in the former case, to forego coercive methods. Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³ ## Deception and Manipulation Such interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW97 reports and editorials or posting political views on social media under the guise of being a target-state citizen is thus unlawful.¹⁹⁵ The difference from the situation described above hinges on the definition of coercion: this kind of deceit leaves the target state defenseless against the foreign intervention. The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰ If the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 similarly subversive.²⁰³ ## Disseminating false or true information Having thus identified the line where lawful persuasion becomes unlawful intervention, it is obvious that more serious activities, such as spreading fake news or forging documents in order to influence the target state's election outcome, are clearly unlawful.²⁰⁴ Although spreading disinformation may possibly lead to a target-state response, the intervenor's intention is to avoid an effective target-state reaction and to deceive that state's electorate. A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations. The intervenor's intention to avoid scrutiny and ward off any reaction on the target state's part makes the interference coercive.\nAs far as the spreading of true information gained by way of MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW99 espionage is concerned, this, too, constitutes unlawful intervention.²⁰⁸ Illicitly gained information is instrumentalized in order to influence the target state’s election results in a meaningful way.²⁰⁹ The fact that the information was gained by way of espionage taints the dissemination of the information. The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹ What remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 ## Funding political parties and/or candidates Funding parties or candidates and their election campaigns in another state, the most favored form of foreign intervention,²¹⁴ is unlawful.²¹⁵ The unlawfulness is particularly obvious when foreign funding of parties and candidates is prohibited in the target state.²¹⁶ In this context, funding is meant to include the training of target-state citizens in campaigning or producing campaigning materials for the preferred candidate. Here, too, the target state is unable to terminate the intervention at its pleasure. By enabling the preferred politicians to outspend their rivals—often by wide margins²¹⁷—the intervenor clearly is attempting to install a government favorable to its own goals that may well even be beholden to it due to the support received.\n## Intrusion on the electoral process itself The most severe kind of intervention in the sphere of election meddling is, of course, the manipulation of the electoral process itself.²¹⁸ Changing election results; making ballots disappear; deleting or adding names to the electoral register; or manipulating electronic voting machines, the\"electoral doomsday scenario,\"²¹⁹ are undoubtedly coercive in nature.²²⁰ The target state is not meant to notice the manipulation MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW101 and is therefore unable to terminate the intervention and the manipulation. If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications The possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵ Irrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the Cyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L. STUD. 549, 561 (2020); Gill, supra note 135, at 234.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 intervenor be targeting an electoral process in support of “democratic” forces in an insufficiently democratic environment, the intervention could possibly be justified on those grounds.²²⁷ On the other hand, the intervention in a “democratic” electoral process could not be justified under international law.²²⁸ Almost needless to say, such a view cannot be reflective of current customary international law, as many states have never been able to lay claim to being a “democracy.”²²⁹ In fact, currently it seems that “democracy” is in retreat, with many societies seemingly preferring stability to democracy.²³⁰ It is therefore highly unlikely that these states would accept a rule in international law according to which an intervention in their electoral processes would be justified, but not vice versa.²³¹ Furthermore, such a hypothetical rule of international law is unsurprisingly bound to be seen as self-serving: a reversion to western exceptionalism on the basis of a putative rule that just so happens to justify Western behavior while protecting Western societies against similar actions.²³² Lastly, the ICJ, too, has in the past ²²⁷.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk, MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103 rejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared: It [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention[233]... The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.[234] ## Economic Measures Nevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful.

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW105 consequences or the promise of economic benefits, as well as the intervening state's conduct, are arguably facts that voters should be considering when casting their vote.\n## Summary A state is free to interfere during another state's election campaign as long as its intent is persuasive rather than coercive. Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016 Applied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 the efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY Intervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of\"sovereignty\"as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty:\"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW107 dispute between the Netherlands and the United States concerning sovereignty over an island, the arbitrator at the Permanent Court of Arbitration explained that sovereignty “signifies independence. Independence, with regards to a portion of the globe, is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”246 There is widespread agreement that a violation of another state’s sovereignty is unlawful under public international law.247 Only very recently, the United Kingdom has sought to call this long-standing view into question by arguing that respect for another state’s sovereignty was not a rule of, but only a principle in, international law.248 Quite rightly, the United Kingdom so far has received very little official support from other states for this questionable line of argument.249 In fact, some International Law, in THE FOURTH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASIAN SOCIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 1, 5 (2013); Schmitt, supra note 10, at 43.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 states have since then rejected the UK's view.²⁵⁰ In 2020, NATO member states also confirmed that sovereignty is a primary rule of international law.²⁵¹ International courts have consistently taken that view,²⁵² as have other states.²⁵³ Some of the activities associated with election meddling are not only prohibited interventions in the internal affairs of another state but also violations of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁴ If the interventions described above are, for example, organized or carried out by the intervenor's embassy or consulate staff on the territory of the target state, then these activities will regularly be not only prohibited interventions but also violations of the target state's territorial sovereignty. For example, a state handing over money to political parties on the target state's territory will be exercising its governmental functions there and thus violating the other state's sovereignty.\nout that no state accused of violating another state's sovereignty had claimed to be entitled to do so); under the Obama Administration, the United States adopted the view that violating another state's sovereignty was unlawful: see Harald Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Sept. 18, 2012); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm; Brian J. Egan, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Nov. 10, 2016); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/264303.htm; see also Rep. Group Governmental Experts on Dev. Field Info. &amp; Telecommunications Context of Int'l Sec. (22 July 2015), UN Doc. A/70/174, ¶ 27, 28 (b); Schmitt, supra note 220, at 554–55.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW109 Similarly, the manipulation of voting machines located on the target state's territory, whether remotely or not, will violate the target state's sovereignty, as the target state's governmental authority is being usurped.²⁵⁵ Some forms of cyber activity, such as the hacking of e-mails stored on servers located within the target state's territory, will also involve an unlawful disregard of that state's sovereignty.²⁵⁶ Nevertheless, basing the unlawfulness of election meddling solely on the violation of the target state's sovereignty has significant drawbacks, as many of the interventions described above would consequently be lawful.²⁵⁷ If a state funds a foreign political party or candidate with the potential effect of massively influencing the outcome of the target state's election, there are many possible scenarios that do not involve a violation of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁸ Basically, it would be sufficient to hand over any monies on the intervenor's territory to avoid any violation of international law. Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰ In summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty. Therefore, the prohibition on violating other states' sovereignty is less relevant to the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 discussion of election meddling than the prohibition on interventions in the internal matters of other states.\n## THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION More recently, Jens David Ohlin has suggested another line of argument. According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³ This line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸ Although the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW111 independent state.²⁷⁰ However, that right of self-determination of a people in an existent state is already protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁷¹ The prohibition on coercive interventions in matters that each state can decide freely also serves to protect that state's people's right of self-determination.²⁷² As the ICJ has explained, an intervention is unlawful when it bears on matters such as\"the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.\"²⁷³ As James Crawford has explained,\"Where a self-determination unit is a State, the principle of self-determination is represented by the rule against intervention in the internal affairs of that State, and in particular in the choice of the form of government of the State.\"²⁷⁴ Thus, prohibited interventions are interventions that (also) violate the target-state people's right of self-determination.²⁷⁵ Furthermore, Ohlin's arguments have little prospect of acceptance as a rule of customary international law due to their implied reliance on the target state's\"democratic\"structures. Ohlin does not explore what the term\"democracy\"means in public international law. Is a state a democracy simply because there are competing parties and voters are permitted to cast ballots?²⁷⁶ Developments in states such as Iraq, Libya, INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 or Afghanistan imply that these criteria are not sufficient.²⁷⁷ What about a state, such as Hungary, that some refer to as an “illiberal democracy”?²⁷⁸ Indeed, some may claim doubts on whether the will of the people is properly reflected in an electoral system that enables a president to be elected against the wishes of the majority of voters, as is possible in the United States.²⁷⁹ Do recent changes to the electoral system in a number of states in the United States (changes which, according to some, are potentially disenfranchising large sections of the electorate),²⁸⁰ possibly mean that the US is no longer protected against outside intervention? Others may question whether a political system that has for decades produced majority governments—based on the support of as little as 35% of voters,²⁸¹ and whose parliamentary system includes a wholly appointed upper chamber,²⁸² as is the case in the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW113 UK—is truly “democratic.” Is it therefore really legitimate to solely exclude states’ political processes from international law’s protection solely because they bar some candidates often favored in the West?²⁸³ Such a view would seem to contradict what the ICJ had to say on interventions based on promoting democracy: “The court cannot contemplate the creation of a new rule opening up a right of intervention by one State against another on the grounds that the latter has opted for some particular ideology or political system.”²⁸⁴ By ignoring these issues, Ohlin’s line of argument runs the risk of being dismissed as both biased and premised on the idea of Western exceptionalism. Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵ and bishops of the Church of England).

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n## CONCLUSION This article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW115 can be classified as “methods of coercion.” The term “coercion” obviously excludes from the prohibition means of persuasion.²⁸⁹ Therefore, it is, for example, not unlawful for a state to publicly state its preferences as to the outcome of an election in another state.²⁹⁰ The interfering state is thereby simply advocating an outcome that it believes to be in its national interest. The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³ However, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 are concerned. Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication, ²⁹⁴.

Res. 2734 (XXV) ¶ 4, Declaration on International Security (Dec. 16, 1970). But see Ohlen, supra note 10, at 67–89 (viewing the prohibition on interventions as protecting only a state's sovereignty). However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117 seems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers.

    "## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES": "Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.\nIn this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the\n13. OHLIN, supra note 10, at 91, 97-104.\n14.

    "## US intervention in the Italian election of 1948": "The Italian parliamentary election of 1948 was an early milestone in foreign election meddling. In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government. This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe. As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations. To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties. Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy. The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election varies between $1 million and $10\n15.

In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57",
    "## Further Examples": "As these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US \"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to \"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this, \"the CIA mounted a massive [. . . ]\n56.

Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States \"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\" the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely \"acquiesc[ed]\" to the US demand for an election. Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate. President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome. Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.\nIn 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections. During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance. US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won. Furthermore, the CIA \"leaked damaging information\" claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.\nRole of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n76.

Allegedly, the US government paid NGOs in Russia to discredit the Russian electoral process even before the election had taken place.⁹³ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned such activities and declared: \"When financing comes to some domestic organizations which are supposedly national, but which in fact work on foreign money and perform to the music of a foreign state during electoral processes, we need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs and defend our sovereignty.\"⁹⁴ Vladimir Putin subsequently also accused the United States of instigating the protests that erupted following the elections, during which claims of electoral fraud were made.⁹⁵\nPast US activities therefore may help explain US President Barack Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"⁹⁶ Although the statement fell short of an explicit condemnation of Russia's conduct as unlawful,⁹⁷ it does at the same time also leave some room for interpreting the US stance in such a way.⁹⁸\nRussia, too, has been accused of meddling in other states' elections on numerous other occasions—for example, in the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016⁹⁹ and its general election in 2019.¹⁰⁰ While the pro-Brexit UK government has so far refused to investigate claims that Russia interfered during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign in favor of the \"Leave\" campaign,¹⁰¹ many others agree that such Russian\n⁹³.

Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷\nThus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted . . .\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

Rather, the intervenor must employ \"methods of coercion\" to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To \"persuade\" has been defined as \"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴\nHowever, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term \"coercion\" in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to \"methods of coercion\" severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited\n138.

There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible.

In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This\n157.

This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This\n165.

Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵\nFor an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹\n172.

The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared:\nIncontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law. . . .\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for\n180.

    "## Persuasion": "Accordingly, the main emphasis of legal analysis must focus on whether the intervenor employed coercive means in order to achieve the desired election result.¹⁸⁹ As indicated earlier, the attempt by one state to persuade another state’s electorate to vote in a specific way is lawful under public international law.¹⁹⁰ What differentiates lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is the decision on the part of the meddling state, in the former case, to forego coercive methods. Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³",

The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰\nIf the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore\n195.

    "## Disseminating false or true information": "Having thus identified the line where lawful persuasion becomes unlawful intervention, it is obvious that more serious activities, such as spreading fake news or forging documents in order to influence the target state's election outcome, are clearly unlawful.²⁰⁴ Although spreading disinformation may possibly lead to a target-state response, the intervenor's intention is to avoid an effective target-state reaction and to deceive that state's electorate. A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations.

In Wheatley's view, spreading true information can be unlawful if \"all other voices are drowned out.\" If such information is disseminated on the eve of an election, this results in other voices being drowned out because they cannot respond before the election takes place.\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW99\nespionage is concerned, this, too, constitutes unlawful intervention.²⁰⁸ Illicitly gained information is instrumentalized in order to influence the target state’s election results in a meaningful way.²⁰⁹ The fact that the information was gained by way of espionage taints the dissemination of the information. The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹\nWhat remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n208.

That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵\nIrrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the\nCyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk,\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103\nrejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared:\nIt [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention. . . The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.",

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic\n235. See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 28–29; but see Helal, supra note 10, at 81–82 (stating such economic measures are not coercive as long as they are not combined with other, unlawful measures in order to achieve the intervenor’s goals).\n236. See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 29–30; Watts, supra note 10, at 12–13; but see Helal, supra note 10, at 7, 62–64, 81–84, 85–86. In Helal’s view, withdrawing or granting benefits in order to achieve a specific election result –though generally lawful– becomes unlawful, if such actions are combined with other unlawful means. He views such a strategy as a composite breach of the non-intervention rule. Less convincingly, he argues that such economic measures merely amount to “persuasion” if not combined with unlawful means. Helal, supra note 10, at 81. For example, Helal views the hacking of the emails circulating among the leadership of Democratic Party and their subsequent publication in order to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election as unlawful. Had Russia at the same time threatened to impose sanctions on the United States, these sanctions would have therefore been rendered unlawful. Had Russia, on the other hand, only threatened the United States with the imposition of sanctions in the case of a Clinton victory, that, in his view, would have been lawful. A potentially extremely coercive measure’s legality (imposition of sanctions) would thus depend on whether the intervenor resorted to other, potentially minor, but unlawful means of intervention, which is not convincing. See also Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention on the Internal Affairs of States, UN GA Res. 36/103 (1981), op. para. II (k). However, it is very doubtful that the resolution reflected customary international law, as many western states opposed the resolution. See Jamnejad, Wood, supra note 138, at 355 n.32.\n237.

    "## Summary": "A state is free to interfere during another state's election campaign as long as its intent is persuasive rather than coercive. Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.",
    "## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016": "Applied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\nthe efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.",
    "## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY": "Intervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of \"sovereignty\" as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty: \"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a\n240.

Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰\nIn summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty.

    "## THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION": "More recently, Jens David Ohlin has suggested another line of argument. According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³\nThis line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸\nAlthough the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an\n262.

Ohlin does not explore what the term \"democracy\" means in public international law. Is a state a democracy simply because there are competing parties and voters are permitted to cast ballots?²⁷⁶ Developments in states such as Iraq, Libya,\n270.

However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it does not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domain réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses. See also Van de Velde, supra note 10, at 15.\n272.

Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵\nand bishops of the Church of England).

Such disagreements could concern many issues of philosophy and practice – for example, single member districts versus at-large election, runoffs, proportional representation of minority parties . . .” possibly offering an intervenor many arguments in order to justify excluding a specific (target) state from its own understanding of democracy.\n284.

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.",
    "## CONCLUSION": "This article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions\n286.

The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³\nHowever, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters\n289.

Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication,\n²⁹⁴.

However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117\nseems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or \"democratic\" exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory.

The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n* Patrick C.

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵ Why, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71 In order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸ The analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰ ⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 Secondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or complexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73 organization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 election meddling will also result in a violation of another state's sovereignty. However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW75 former intervention that was more intrusive and likely more successful.\n## US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 The Italian parliamentary election of 1948 was an early milestone in foreign election meddling. In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10 INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 million.²² Such generosity enabled the anti-Communist parties to spend 7.5 times more on the election campaign than the Communists.²³ This generosity was accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign that highlighted Soviet activities in Eastern Europe.²⁴ Pamphlets were produced that targeted Communist politicians' personal lives.²⁵ Letters allegedly from members of the Communist Party were forged and published widely.²⁶ Voice of America regularly broadcast US propaganda, as did various commercial radio stations with the support of the US State Department.²⁷ A massive letter-writing campaign was organized whereby Americans of Italian extraction were encouraged to write to their relatives in Italy to discourage them from voting for the Communists. At first written by Italian Americans themselves, these letters were soon mass-produced and only required an address and a signature.²⁸ Around ten million of such letters were sent to Italy.²⁹ On the other hand, the United States publicly threatened to reduce or stop any economic assistance should the Communists be elected, while promising to increase such aid in the event of the emergence of a government excluding the Communist Party.³⁰ Furthermore, the United States threatened to bar all Italians who were members of the Communist Party from entering the United States.³¹ There was some British assistance in support of US election interference.³² In the British Embassy in Rome, a committee was formed to organize covert election meddling.³³ To guarantee more favorable https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=1&amp;year=1948 (last visited Jan. 29, 2022) (calculating that $1 in 1948 equals around $11.13 in 2021).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW77 reporting in Italian newspapers, journalists were bribed.³⁴ Unattributable papers were distributed to influence the electorate.³⁵ The greatest British triumph probably was the creation of the popular Don Camillo and Peppone series about a Communist mayor and a Catholic priest.³⁶ Nevertheless, due to financial restraints, the British effort was minor in comparison to US involvement.³⁷ US intervention in Italy might have become much more far-reaching had the Communists won the election. In some circles within the US government, there were debates on whether to intervene militarily or support a coup carried out by Italian military forces should the Communist Party emerge victorious from the elections.³⁸ In the end, the party supported by the United States, the Christian Democrats, won the 1948 parliamentary elections.³⁹ This was mainly or at least partly due, many believe, to the United States' massive involvement in the election campaign.⁴⁰ ## Russian intervention in the U.S. election of 2016 In early 2016, the Russian government and figures associated with the Russian government began to prepare their campaign of interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. The aim of Russian meddling was to help defeat the Democratic Party candidate, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—who was perceived as being very critical of the Russian government—and to support the election of the Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump.⁴¹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 According to US authorities, Russia also sought to sow discord among Americans⁴² and to generally undermine public trust in the US electoral process and system of government.⁴³ To achieve this, the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), which according to the US government was “tasked” to do this by the Russian government,⁴⁴ bought advertisements supportive of Trump, or his policies, on social media sites, such as Facebook.⁴⁵ Moreover, in order to achieve its goal, fictitious Facebook,⁴⁶ Instagram,⁴⁷ and Twitter accounts were created.⁴⁸ Overall, the IRA was responsible for more than 61,500 posts on Facebook, more than 116,000 posts on Instagram, and more than 10.4 million tweets on Twitter.⁴⁹ In all of these instances, the IRA’s authorship was not acknowledged. Rather, the aim was to create the impression that these were messages posted by US citizens.⁵⁰ According to one estimate, the Russian-inspired Facebook posts reached 126 million users.⁵¹ Many of these posts were also successful in instigating actual US citizens to take further action, such as forwarding the posts to acquaintances.⁵² The IRA also used its social media presence to promote Trump rallies.⁵³ In addition, Russian news sites and television channels, such as RT and Sputnik, regularly broadcast material that was supportive of Trump and critical of Clinton.⁵⁴ Furthermore, Russia initiated the hacking of email accounts of persons in the Democratic Party leadership who were associated with Hillary Clinton.⁵⁵ These emails, which were damaging to the Clinton campaign, were subsequently published by WikiLeaks, allegedly in note 10, at 186.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW79 cooperation with Russian government circles.56 As is well known, the candidate the Russian government supported, Donald Trump, was victorious in the 2016 presidential election. In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57 ## Further Examples As these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US\"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to\"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this,\"the CIA mounted a massive [... ] INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 propaganda campaign\"62 that in the end resulted in\"24 daily newscasts in Santiago and the provinces, 26 weekly 'commentary' programs, and... 3,000 posters daily.\"63 The CIA concluded that this campaign was decisive in securing a majority for the favored candidate, Eduardo Frei.64 The United States also intervened in the congressional elections of 1965 and 1969 by providing campaign funding and producing propaganda.65 In 1965, nine of the twenty-two candidates supported by the CIA were elected;66 in 1969, ten of twelve.67 The Senate Report concludes that these CIA efforts were\"relatively successful\"and produced a\"substantial cumulative effect over these years.\"68 During the election campaign for the presidential election in 1970, the United States again interfered on a grand scale: although there was hardly any direct funding of political parties,69 the CIA once more launched a\"massive propaganda campaign.\"70 This included\"black propaganda\"in order to undermine the leftist coalition, a\"newsletter\"sent to\"journalists, academicians, politicians,\"and editorials, as well as radio broadcasts.71 In this instance, however, US involvement could not prevent the leftist candidate, Salvador Allende, from winning a plurality in the election.72 Subsequently, the United States unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Chile's Congress from confirming Salvador Allende as President.73 Political statements to that effect were issued, a new propaganda campaign was launched, economic pressure was exerted, and signals were given to military officers and others that a coup would be acceptable to the United States.74 The US also intervened in other Latin American elections, mainly in the 1980s and 1990s.75 Two examples are the 1982 election in El MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW81 Salvador and the 1990 election in Nicaragua. Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States\"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\"the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely\"acquiesc[ed]\"to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79] In 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA\"leaked damaging information\"claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83] Role of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 The United States' preferred candidate won.\nMore recently, the United States has been accused of interfering in Russia's presidential election of 1996⁸⁴ and the parliamentary election of 2011.⁸⁵ Dov Levin has described US interference in Russia's 1996 presidential election in favor of Boris Yeltsin as\"one of the most massive electoral interventions recorded in [his] dataset,\"⁸⁶ which covers the period from 1946 to 2000. The US government seemed to believe that the deeply unpopular Yeltsin⁸⁷ was the only democratic candidate and that it was necessary to prevent the victory of the Communist Party candidate.⁸⁸ In a highly critical report, the Speaker's Special Advisory Group on Russia concluded in 2000 that the US government had\"pressur[ed]\"the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\"to grant $10.2 billion in credits to Russia\"and had thereby\"effectively used the Fund... to subsidize Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign.\"⁸⁹ Furthermore, US spin-doctors flew into Moscow to support Boris Yeltsin's campaign.⁹⁰ According to some reports, their work was decisive in securing his eventual victory.⁹¹ How closely these advisors were connected to the US government remains unclear.⁹² During the 2011 parliamentary election campaign, the Russian government accused the US of interference in order to undermine MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW83 Russia's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Allegedly, the US government paid NGOs in Russia to discredit the Russian electoral process even before the election had taken place.⁹³ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned such activities and declared:\"When financing comes to some domestic organizations which are supposedly national, but which in fact work on foreign money and perform to the music of a foreign state during electoral processes, we need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs and defend our sovereignty.\"⁹⁴ Vladimir Putin subsequently also accused the United States of instigating the protests that erupted following the elections, during which claims of electoral fraud were made.⁹⁵ Past US activities therefore may help explain US President Barack Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"⁹⁶ Although the statement fell short of an explicit condemnation of Russia's conduct as unlawful,⁹⁷ it does at the same time also leave some room for interpreting the US stance in such a way.⁹⁸ Russia, too, has been accused of meddling in other states' elections on numerous other occasions—for example, in the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016⁹⁹ and its general election in 2019.¹⁰⁰ While the pro-Brexit UK government has so far refused to investigate claims that Russia interfered during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign in favor of the\"Leave\"campaign,¹⁰¹ many others agree that such Russian ⁹³.

Evans ed., 5th ed. 2018).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 confirmed that the Friendly Relations Resolution was “declaratory of customary international law.”¹³³ The ICJ itself had previously stressed the legal quality of the prohibition of such interventions: already in 1949, it declared interventions in other states’ affairs to be unlawful.¹³⁴ The prohibition on interventions in the internal or external affairs of another state therefore qualifies as a rule of customary international law.¹³⁵ The ICJ’s 1986 judgment in the Nicaragua case is frequently cited when discussing the prohibition of interventions because the court provided a partial definition of the prohibition’s scope. Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention: A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷ Thus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted...\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

Rather, the intervenor must employ\"methods of coercion\"to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To\"persuade\"has been defined as\"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴ However, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term\"coercion\"in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to\"methods of coercion\"severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 when the level of coercion is comparable to the threat to use force.¹⁴⁸ The inaccuracy of this view becomes obvious when some claim that coercive intervention must be “dictatorial” in nature, leaving the target state with no room for maneuver,¹⁴⁹ and that coercion requires the target state to be fully aware of its being coerced.¹⁵⁰ This very limited view of prohibited interventions is unconvincing.¹⁵¹ When partially defining the term “nonintervention,” the ICJ stressed it was only looking at “those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant” to the case before it.¹⁵² The court was dealing with the United States’ massive support of the Nicaraguan rebels, the Contras, who were attempting to overthrow their country’s government by force. There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible. Rather, the difference between coercive intervention and permissible persuasion comes down to whether the target state retains its freedom to choose in matters related to its independence as a state.¹⁵⁶ supra note 138 (offering a general discussion of the difficulty of distinguishing between acceptable “persuasion” of another state and unlawful “coercion”).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW91 Thus, an intervention is unlawful when the aim is to deprive the target state of its discretion to decide freely on issues related to its internal or external affairs.¹⁵⁷ As DeWitt Dickinson indicated in 1920, intervention is prohibited when it “cannot be terminated at the pleasure of the state that is subject to the intervention.”¹⁵⁸ Coercion, thus, merely requires that the target state is unable to respond to the outside interference and is therefore forced to tolerate it, irrespective of whether this tolerance is due to inability or lack of awareness. In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 excludes from the prohibition all activities by the intervening state of which the target state is not aware. This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW93 argument is similarly unconvincing. Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵ For an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 In summary, intervention is usually unlawful when a state is targeting the internal affairs of another state and thereby employing methods that the target state cannot\"terminate at its pleasure\"¹⁸⁰ and therefore are coercive. It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law. In order to reach a definitive verdict, however, it also needs to be ascertained that the intervening state was not acting within its rights under public international law when resorting to coercion.\n## Prohibited interventions in other states' elections\"In addition, I would be in favor of legislation prohibiting interference with the electoral processes in other countries.\"¹⁸¹ Cyrus Vance thus expressed his wish for US legislation outlawing foreign election meddling. The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared: Incontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law....\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW95 the purpose of influencing American public opinion on a political question.¹⁸³ Elections determine a people’s “choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy,” a decision which, according to the ICJ, must remain free.¹⁸⁴ There is, therefore, widespread agreement that a state’s electoral process is a matter within a state’s *domaine réservé* and is protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁸⁵ This protection is confirmed by numerous General Assembly resolutions that have stated that: [A]ny activities that attempt, directly or indirectly, to interfere in the free development of national electoral processes, in particular in the developing countries, or that are intended to sway the results of such processes, violate the spirit and letter of the principles established in the Charter and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.¹⁸⁶ Furthermore, the fact that intervenors often seem to succeed in influencing target-state election results,¹⁸⁷ thereby securing for themselves a say in choosing a target state’s government, renders any contrary arguments unconvincing. As Ray Meyer has pointed out, such an intervention, if successful, can result in “an inherently more extensive intervention in internal affairs because it may involve an indirect intervention in all future policy decisions made by the tainted INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 government.”¹⁸⁸ ## Persuasion Accordingly, the main emphasis of legal analysis must focus on whether the intervenor employed coercive means in order to achieve the desired election result.¹⁸⁹ As indicated earlier, the attempt by one state to persuade another state’s electorate to vote in a specific way is lawful under public international law.¹⁹⁰ What differentiates lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is the decision on the part of the meddling state, in the former case, to forego coercive methods. Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³ ## Deception and Manipulation Such interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW97 reports and editorials or posting political views on social media under the guise of being a target-state citizen is thus unlawful.¹⁹⁵ The difference from the situation described above hinges on the definition of coercion: this kind of deceit leaves the target state defenseless against the foreign intervention. The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰ If the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 similarly subversive.²⁰³ ## Disseminating false or true information Having thus identified the line where lawful persuasion becomes unlawful intervention, it is obvious that more serious activities, such as spreading fake news or forging documents in order to influence the target state's election outcome, are clearly unlawful.²⁰⁴ Although spreading disinformation may possibly lead to a target-state response, the intervenor's intention is to avoid an effective target-state reaction and to deceive that state's electorate. A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations. The intervenor's intention to avoid scrutiny and ward off any reaction on the target state's part makes the interference coercive.\nAs far as the spreading of true information gained by way of MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW99 espionage is concerned, this, too, constitutes unlawful intervention.²⁰⁸ Illicitly gained information is instrumentalized in order to influence the target state’s election results in a meaningful way.²⁰⁹ The fact that the information was gained by way of espionage taints the dissemination of the information. The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹ What remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 ## Funding political parties and/or candidates Funding parties or candidates and their election campaigns in another state, the most favored form of foreign intervention,²¹⁴ is unlawful.²¹⁵ The unlawfulness is particularly obvious when foreign funding of parties and candidates is prohibited in the target state.²¹⁶ In this context, funding is meant to include the training of target-state citizens in campaigning or producing campaigning materials for the preferred candidate. Here, too, the target state is unable to terminate the intervention at its pleasure. By enabling the preferred politicians to outspend their rivals—often by wide margins²¹⁷—the intervenor clearly is attempting to install a government favorable to its own goals that may well even be beholden to it due to the support received.\n## Intrusion on the electoral process itself The most severe kind of intervention in the sphere of election meddling is, of course, the manipulation of the electoral process itself.²¹⁸ Changing election results; making ballots disappear; deleting or adding names to the electoral register; or manipulating electronic voting machines, the\"electoral doomsday scenario,\"²¹⁹ are undoubtedly coercive in nature.²²⁰ The target state is not meant to notice the manipulation MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW101 and is therefore unable to terminate the intervention and the manipulation. If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications The possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵ Irrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the Cyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L. STUD. 549, 561 (2020); Gill, supra note 135, at 234.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 intervenor be targeting an electoral process in support of “democratic” forces in an insufficiently democratic environment, the intervention could possibly be justified on those grounds.²²⁷ On the other hand, the intervention in a “democratic” electoral process could not be justified under international law.²²⁸ Almost needless to say, such a view cannot be reflective of current customary international law, as many states have never been able to lay claim to being a “democracy.”²²⁹ In fact, currently it seems that “democracy” is in retreat, with many societies seemingly preferring stability to democracy.²³⁰ It is therefore highly unlikely that these states would accept a rule in international law according to which an intervention in their electoral processes would be justified, but not vice versa.²³¹ Furthermore, such a hypothetical rule of international law is unsurprisingly bound to be seen as self-serving: a reversion to western exceptionalism on the basis of a putative rule that just so happens to justify Western behavior while protecting Western societies against similar actions.²³² Lastly, the ICJ, too, has in the past ²²⁷.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk, MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103 rejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared: It [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention[233]... The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.[234] ## Economic Measures Nevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful. The threat of economic sanctions or the promise of financial, trade, or other benefits should a particular government be elected can undoubtedly have an enormously President Gerald Ford, CIA Covert Operations, and the Status of International Law, 69 AM.

Based on their view that interventions in favor of self-determination should be viewed differently than other interventions, they conveniently conclude that U.S. interventions in Italy or Greece promoted self-determination, while the Soviet Union's interventions unfailingly achieved the opposite).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 coercive effect.²³⁵ Voters threatened with severe economic consequences or enticed by the promise of a bright future may well be compelled to vote in a particular way. Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW105 consequences or the promise of economic benefits, as well as the intervening state's conduct, are arguably facts that voters should be considering when casting their vote.\n## Summary A state is free to interfere during another state's election campaign as long as its intent is persuasive rather than coercive. Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016 Applied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 the efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY Intervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of\"sovereignty\"as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty:\"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW107 dispute between the Netherlands and the United States concerning sovereignty over an island, the arbitrator at the Permanent Court of Arbitration explained that sovereignty “signifies independence. Independence, with regards to a portion of the globe, is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”246 There is widespread agreement that a violation of another state’s sovereignty is unlawful under public international law.247 Only very recently, the United Kingdom has sought to call this long-standing view into question by arguing that respect for another state’s sovereignty was not a rule of, but only a principle in, international law.248 Quite rightly, the United Kingdom so far has received very little official support from other states for this questionable line of argument.249 In fact, some International Law, in THE FOURTH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASIAN SOCIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 1, 5 (2013); Schmitt, supra note 10, at 43.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 states have since then rejected the UK's view.²⁵⁰ In 2020, NATO member states also confirmed that sovereignty is a primary rule of international law.²⁵¹ International courts have consistently taken that view,²⁵² as have other states.²⁵³ Some of the activities associated with election meddling are not only prohibited interventions in the internal affairs of another state but also violations of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁴ If the interventions described above are, for example, organized or carried out by the intervenor's embassy or consulate staff on the territory of the target state, then these activities will regularly be not only prohibited interventions but also violations of the target state's territorial sovereignty. For example, a state handing over money to political parties on the target state's territory will be exercising its governmental functions there and thus violating the other state's sovereignty.\nout that no state accused of violating another state's sovereignty had claimed to be entitled to do so); under the Obama Administration, the United States adopted the view that violating another state's sovereignty was unlawful: see Harald Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Sept. 18, 2012); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm; Brian J. Egan, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Nov. 10, 2016); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/264303.htm; see also Rep. Group Governmental Experts on Dev. Field Info. &amp; Telecommunications Context of Int'l Sec. (22 July 2015), UN Doc. A/70/174, ¶ 27, 28 (b); Schmitt, supra note 220, at 554–55.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW109 Similarly, the manipulation of voting machines located on the target state's territory, whether remotely or not, will violate the target state's sovereignty, as the target state's governmental authority is being usurped.²⁵⁵ Some forms of cyber activity, such as the hacking of e-mails stored on servers located within the target state's territory, will also involve an unlawful disregard of that state's sovereignty.²⁵⁶ Nevertheless, basing the unlawfulness of election meddling solely on the violation of the target state's sovereignty has significant drawbacks, as many of the interventions described above would consequently be lawful.²⁵⁷ If a state funds a foreign political party or candidate with the potential effect of massively influencing the outcome of the target state's election, there are many possible scenarios that do not involve a violation of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁸ Basically, it would be sufficient to hand over any monies on the intervenor's territory to avoid any violation of international law. Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰ In summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty. Therefore, the prohibition on violating other states' sovereignty is less relevant to the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 discussion of election meddling than the prohibition on interventions in the internal matters of other states.\n## THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION More recently, Jens David Ohlin has suggested another line of argument. According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³ This line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸ Although the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW111 independent state.²⁷⁰ However, that right of self-determination of a people in an existent state is already protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁷¹ The prohibition on coercive interventions in matters that each state can decide freely also serves to protect that state's people's right of self-determination.²⁷² As the ICJ has explained, an intervention is unlawful when it bears on matters such as\"the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.\"²⁷³ As James Crawford has explained,\"Where a self-determination unit is a State, the principle of self-determination is represented by the rule against intervention in the internal affairs of that State, and in particular in the choice of the form of government of the State.\"²⁷⁴ Thus, prohibited interventions are interventions that (also) violate the target-state people's right of self-determination.²⁷⁵ Furthermore, Ohlin's arguments have little prospect of acceptance as a rule of customary international law due to their implied reliance on the target state's\"democratic\"structures. Ohlin does not explore what the term\"democracy\"means in public international law. Is a state a democracy simply because there are competing parties and voters are permitted to cast ballots?²⁷⁶ Developments in states such as Iraq, Libya, INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 or Afghanistan imply that these criteria are not sufficient.²⁷⁷ What about a state, such as Hungary, that some refer to as an “illiberal democracy”?²⁷⁸ Indeed, some may claim doubts on whether the will of the people is properly reflected in an electoral system that enables a president to be elected against the wishes of the majority of voters, as is possible in the United States.²⁷⁹ Do recent changes to the electoral system in a number of states in the United States (changes which, according to some, are potentially disenfranchising large sections of the electorate),²⁸⁰ possibly mean that the US is no longer protected against outside intervention? Others may question whether a political system that has for decades produced majority governments—based on the support of as little as 35% of voters,²⁸¹ and whose parliamentary system includes a wholly appointed upper chamber,²⁸² as is the case in the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW113 UK—is truly “democratic.” Is it therefore really legitimate to solely exclude states’ political processes from international law’s protection solely because they bar some candidates often favored in the West?²⁸³ Such a view would seem to contradict what the ICJ had to say on interventions based on promoting democracy: “The court cannot contemplate the creation of a new rule opening up a right of intervention by one State against another on the grounds that the latter has opted for some particular ideology or political system.”²⁸⁴ By ignoring these issues, Ohlin’s line of argument runs the risk of being dismissed as both biased and premised on the idea of Western exceptionalism. Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵ and bishops of the Church of England).

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n## CONCLUSION This article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW115 can be classified as “methods of coercion.” The term “coercion” obviously excludes from the prohibition means of persuasion.²⁸⁹ Therefore, it is, for example, not unlawful for a state to publicly state its preferences as to the outcome of an election in another state.²⁹⁰ The interfering state is thereby simply advocating an outcome that it believes to be in its national interest. The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³ However, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 are concerned. Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication, ²⁹⁴.

Res. 2734 (XXV) ¶ 4, Declaration on International Security (Dec. 16, 1970). But see Ohlen, supra note 10, at 67–89 (viewing the prohibition on interventions as protecting only a state's sovereignty). However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117 seems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or\"democratic\"exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domaine réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses.

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵ Why, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.",

MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71 In order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸ The analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰ ⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 Secondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state. But the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign. In these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or complexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention). MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73 organization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not. My analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote. Before concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often",

However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects. In this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct. ## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the",

In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10",

It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state. There have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed. The US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US \"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to \"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this, \"the CIA mounted a massive [. . . ]",

Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States \"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\" the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely \"acquiesc[ed]\" to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79] In 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA \"leaked damaging information\" claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83] Role of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).",

INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 confirmed that the Friendly Relations Resolution was “declaratory of customary international law.”¹³³ The ICJ itself had previously stressed the legal quality of the prohibition of such interventions: already in 1949, it declared interventions in other states’ affairs to be unlawful.¹³⁴ The prohibition on interventions in the internal or external affairs of another state therefore qualifies as a rule of customary international law.¹³⁵ The ICJ’s 1986 judgment in the Nicaragua case is frequently cited when discussing the prohibition of interventions because the court provided a partial definition of the prohibition’s scope. Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention: A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷ Thus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted . . .

Rather, the intervenor must employ \"methods of coercion\" to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To \"persuade\" has been defined as \"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴ However, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term \"coercion\" in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to \"methods of coercion\" severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited",

For the purposes of Article 18, coercion “has the same essential character as force majeure,” “giving it [the target state] no effective choice but to comply with the wishes of the coercing state.” Id. at 69. However, the ILC repeatedly emphasized that this “narrow,” definition only applied “for the purpose of Article 18.” Id. at 69–70. Article 18’s scope is narrow as it only applies to the coercing state’s responsibility under international law for an unlawful act committed by the coerced state. Therefore, it is not intended to provide a general definition of the term coercion in public international law.",

MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW91 Thus, an intervention is unlawful when the aim is to deprive the target state of its discretion to decide freely on issues related to its internal or external affairs.¹⁵⁷ As DeWitt Dickinson indicated in 1920, intervention is prohibited when it “cannot be terminated at the pleasure of the state that is subject to the intervention.”¹⁵⁸ Coercion, thus, merely requires that the target state is unable to respond to the outside interference and is therefore forced to tolerate it, irrespective of whether this tolerance is due to inability or lack of awareness. In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs. This is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning. Some claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This",

This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.

Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵ For an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law.

INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 In summary, intervention is usually unlawful when a state is targeting the internal affairs of another state and thereby employing methods that the target state cannot \"terminate at its pleasure\"¹⁸⁰ and therefore are coercive. It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law.

The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared: Incontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law. . . .

Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³ ## Deception and Manipulation Such interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in",

MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW97 reports and editorials or posting political views on social media under the guise of being a target-state citizen is thus unlawful.¹⁹⁵ The difference from the situation described above hinges on the definition of coercion: this kind of deceit leaves the target state defenseless against the foreign intervention. The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰ If the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore",

If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process. ## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications The possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵ Irrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the Cyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk, MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103 rejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared: It [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention[233]. . . The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.[234] ## Economic Measures Nevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful.

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result.

In Helal’s view, withdrawing or granting benefits in order to achieve a specific election result –though generally lawful– becomes unlawful, if such actions are combined with other unlawful means. He views such a strategy as a composite breach of the non-intervention rule. Less convincingly, he argues that such economic measures merely amount to “persuasion” if not combined with unlawful means. Helal, supra note 10, at 81. For example, Helal views the hacking of the emails circulating among the leadership of Democratic Party and their subsequent publication in order to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election as unlawful. Had Russia at the same time threatened to impose sanctions on the United States, these sanctions would have therefore been rendered unlawful. Had Russia, on the other hand, only threatened the United States with the imposition of sanctions in the case of a Clinton victory, that, in his view, would have been lawful. A potentially extremely coercive measure’s legality (imposition of sanctions) would thus depend on whether the intervenor resorted to other, potentially minor, but unlawful means of intervention, which is not convincing.

MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW105 consequences or the promise of economic benefits, as well as the intervening state's conduct, are arguably facts that voters should be considering when casting their vote. ## Summary A state is free to interfere during another state's election campaign as long as its intent is persuasive rather than coercive. Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion. Once a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion. ## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016 Applied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive. The forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 the efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs. ## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY Intervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of \"sovereignty\" as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty: \"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a",

According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³ This line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸ Although the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an",

However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy.

In summary, there is no need to rely on a right of self-determination as far as existent states are concerned, as their peoples' right of self-determination is sufficiently protected by the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states. Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving. ## CONCLUSION This article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions",

MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW115 can be classified as “methods of coercion.” The term “coercion” obviously excludes from the prohibition means of persuasion.²⁸⁹ Therefore, it is, for example, not unlawful for a state to publicly state its preferences as to the outcome of an election in another state.²⁹⁰ The interfering state is thereby simply advocating an outcome that it believes to be in its national interest. The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond. Such persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³ However, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters",

Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections. After explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication, ²⁹⁴.

Res. 2734 (XXV) ¶ 4, Declaration on International Security (Dec. 16, 1970). But see Ohlen, supra note 10, at 67–89 (viewing the prohibition on interventions as protecting only a state's sovereignty). However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117 seems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states. Many forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or \"democratic\" exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail. does not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domaine réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses. See also Van de Velde, supra note 10, at 15.",

However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects. In this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct. ## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the"

The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA \"leaked damaging information\" claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83] Role of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983)."

MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71 In order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸ The analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰ ⁸.

Duncan Hollis, The Influence of War; The War for Influence, 32 TEMP. INT'L &amp; COMPAR. L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 Secondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state. But the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign. In these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or complexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention). MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73 organization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not. My analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote. Before concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often"

If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves. . . .¹\nFollowing the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, there has been noticeable interest in the lawfulness of foreign interference in another state's elections under public international law. The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n* Patrick C. R. Terry is the Dean of the Faculty of Law and a Professor of Law at the University of Public Administration in Kehl (Germany).

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵ Why, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71 In order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸ The analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰ ⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 Secondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or complexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73 organization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 election meddling will also result in a violation of another state's sovereignty. However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW75 former intervention that was more intrusive and likely more successful.\n## US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 The Italian parliamentary election of 1948 was an early milestone in foreign election meddling. In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10 INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 million.²² Such generosity enabled the anti-Communist parties to spend 7.5 times more on the election campaign than the Communists.²³ This generosity was accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign that highlighted Soviet activities in Eastern Europe.²⁴ Pamphlets were produced that targeted Communist politicians' personal lives.²⁵ Letters allegedly from members of the Communist Party were forged and published widely.²⁶ Voice of America regularly broadcast US propaganda, as did various commercial radio stations with the support of the US State Department.²⁷ A massive letter-writing campaign was organized whereby Americans of Italian extraction were encouraged to write to their relatives in Italy to discourage them from voting for the Communists. At first written by Italian Americans themselves, these letters were soon mass-produced and only required an address and a signature.²⁸ Around ten million of such letters were sent to Italy.²⁹ On the other hand, the United States publicly threatened to reduce or stop any economic assistance should the Communists be elected, while promising to increase such aid in the event of the emergence of a government excluding the Communist Party.³⁰ Furthermore, the United States threatened to bar all Italians who were members of the Communist Party from entering the United States.³¹ There was some British assistance in support of US election interference.³² In the British Embassy in Rome, a committee was formed to organize covert election meddling.³³ To guarantee more favorable https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=1&amp;year=1948 (last visited Jan. 29, 2022) (calculating that $1 in 1948 equals around $11.13 in 2021).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW77 reporting in Italian newspapers, journalists were bribed.³⁴ Unattributable papers were distributed to influence the electorate.³⁵ The greatest British triumph probably was the creation of the popular Don Camillo and Peppone series about a Communist mayor and a Catholic priest.³⁶ Nevertheless, due to financial restraints, the British effort was minor in comparison to US involvement.³⁷ US intervention in Italy might have become much more far-reaching had the Communists won the election. In some circles within the US government, there were debates on whether to intervene militarily or support a coup carried out by Italian military forces should the Communist Party emerge victorious from the elections.³⁸ In the end, the party supported by the United States, the Christian Democrats, won the 1948 parliamentary elections.³⁹ This was mainly or at least partly due, many believe, to the United States' massive involvement in the election campaign.⁴⁰ ## Russian intervention in the U.S. election of 2016 In early 2016, the Russian government and figures associated with the Russian government began to prepare their campaign of interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. The aim of Russian meddling was to help defeat the Democratic Party candidate, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—who was perceived as being very critical of the Russian government—and to support the election of the Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump.⁴¹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 According to US authorities, Russia also sought to sow discord among Americans⁴² and to generally undermine public trust in the US electoral process and system of government.⁴³ To achieve this, the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), which according to the US government was “tasked” to do this by the Russian government,⁴⁴ bought advertisements supportive of Trump, or his policies, on social media sites, such as Facebook.⁴⁵ Moreover, in order to achieve its goal, fictitious Facebook,⁴⁶ Instagram,⁴⁷ and Twitter accounts were created.⁴⁸ Overall, the IRA was responsible for more than 61,500 posts on Facebook, more than 116,000 posts on Instagram, and more than 10.4 million tweets on Twitter.⁴⁹ In all of these instances, the IRA’s authorship was not acknowledged. Rather, the aim was to create the impression that these were messages posted by US citizens.⁵⁰ According to one estimate, the Russian-inspired Facebook posts reached 126 million users.⁵¹ Many of these posts were also successful in instigating actual US citizens to take further action, such as forwarding the posts to acquaintances.⁵² The IRA also used its social media presence to promote Trump rallies.⁵³ In addition, Russian news sites and television channels, such as RT and Sputnik, regularly broadcast material that was supportive of Trump and critical of Clinton.⁵⁴ Furthermore, Russia initiated the hacking of email accounts of persons in the Democratic Party leadership who were associated with Hillary Clinton.⁵⁵ These emails, which were damaging to the Clinton campaign, were subsequently published by WikiLeaks, allegedly in note 10, at 186.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW79 cooperation with Russian government circles.56 As is well known, the candidate the Russian government supported, Donald Trump, was victorious in the 2016 presidential election. In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57 ## Further Examples As these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US\"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to\"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this,\"the CIA mounted a massive [... ] INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 propaganda campaign\"62 that in the end resulted in\"24 daily newscasts in Santiago and the provinces, 26 weekly 'commentary' programs, and... 3,000 posters daily.\"63 The CIA concluded that this campaign was decisive in securing a majority for the favored candidate, Eduardo Frei.64 The United States also intervened in the congressional elections of 1965 and 1969 by providing campaign funding and producing propaganda.65 In 1965, nine of the twenty-two candidates supported by the CIA were elected;66 in 1969, ten of twelve.67 The Senate Report concludes that these CIA efforts were\"relatively successful\"and produced a\"substantial cumulative effect over these years.\"68 During the election campaign for the presidential election in 1970, the United States again interfered on a grand scale: although there was hardly any direct funding of political parties,69 the CIA once more launched a\"massive propaganda campaign.\"70 This included\"black propaganda\"in order to undermine the leftist coalition, a\"newsletter\"sent to\"journalists, academicians, politicians,\"and editorials, as well as radio broadcasts.71 In this instance, however, US involvement could not prevent the leftist candidate, Salvador Allende, from winning a plurality in the election.72 Subsequently, the United States unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Chile's Congress from confirming Salvador Allende as President.73 Political statements to that effect were issued, a new propaganda campaign was launched, economic pressure was exerted, and signals were given to military officers and others that a coup would be acceptable to the United States.74 The US also intervened in other Latin American elections, mainly in the 1980s and 1990s.75 Two examples are the 1982 election in El MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW81 Salvador and the 1990 election in Nicaragua. Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States\"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\"the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely\"acquiesc[ed]\"to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79] In 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA\"leaked damaging information\"claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83] Role of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 The United States' preferred candidate won.\nMore recently, the United States has been accused of interfering in Russia's presidential election of 1996⁸⁴ and the parliamentary election of 2011.⁸⁵ Dov Levin has described US interference in Russia's 1996 presidential election in favor of Boris Yeltsin as\"one of the most massive electoral interventions recorded in [his] dataset,\"⁸⁶ which covers the period from 1946 to 2000. The US government seemed to believe that the deeply unpopular Yeltsin⁸⁷ was the only democratic candidate and that it was necessary to prevent the victory of the Communist Party candidate.⁸⁸ In a highly critical report, the Speaker's Special Advisory Group on Russia concluded in 2000 that the US government had\"pressur[ed]\"the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\"to grant $10.2 billion in credits to Russia\"and had thereby\"effectively used the Fund... to subsidize Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign.\"⁸⁹ Furthermore, US spin-doctors flew into Moscow to support Boris Yeltsin's campaign.⁹⁰ According to some reports, their work was decisive in securing his eventual victory.⁹¹ How closely these advisors were connected to the US government remains unclear.⁹² During the 2011 parliamentary election campaign, the Russian government accused the US of interference in order to undermine MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW83 Russia's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Allegedly, the US government paid NGOs in Russia to discredit the Russian electoral process even before the election had taken place.⁹³ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned such activities and declared:\"When financing comes to some domestic organizations which are supposedly national, but which in fact work on foreign money and perform to the music of a foreign state during electoral processes, we need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs and defend our sovereignty.\"⁹⁴ Vladimir Putin subsequently also accused the United States of instigating the protests that erupted following the elections, during which claims of electoral fraud were made.⁹⁵ Past US activities therefore may help explain US President Barack Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"⁹⁶ Although the statement fell short of an explicit condemnation of Russia's conduct as unlawful,⁹⁷ it does at the same time also leave some room for interpreting the US stance in such a way.⁹⁸ Russia, too, has been accused of meddling in other states' elections on numerous other occasions—for example, in the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016⁹⁹ and its general election in 2019.¹⁰⁰ While the pro-Brexit UK government has so far refused to investigate claims that Russia interfered during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign in favor of the\"Leave\"campaign,¹⁰¹ many others agree that such Russian ⁹³.

Evans ed., 5th ed. 2018).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 confirmed that the Friendly Relations Resolution was “declaratory of customary international law.”¹³³ The ICJ itself had previously stressed the legal quality of the prohibition of such interventions: already in 1949, it declared interventions in other states’ affairs to be unlawful.¹³⁴ The prohibition on interventions in the internal or external affairs of another state therefore qualifies as a rule of customary international law.¹³⁵ The ICJ’s 1986 judgment in the Nicaragua case is frequently cited when discussing the prohibition of interventions because the court provided a partial definition of the prohibition’s scope. Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention: A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷ Thus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted...\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

Rather, the intervenor must employ\"methods of coercion\"to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To\"persuade\"has been defined as\"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴ However, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term\"coercion\"in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to\"methods of coercion\"severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 when the level of coercion is comparable to the threat to use force.¹⁴⁸ The inaccuracy of this view becomes obvious when some claim that coercive intervention must be “dictatorial” in nature, leaving the target state with no room for maneuver,¹⁴⁹ and that coercion requires the target state to be fully aware of its being coerced.¹⁵⁰ This very limited view of prohibited interventions is unconvincing.¹⁵¹ When partially defining the term “nonintervention,” the ICJ stressed it was only looking at “those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant” to the case before it.¹⁵² The court was dealing with the United States’ massive support of the Nicaraguan rebels, the Contras, who were attempting to overthrow their country’s government by force. There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible. Rather, the difference between coercive intervention and permissible persuasion comes down to whether the target state retains its freedom to choose in matters related to its independence as a state.¹⁵⁶ supra note 138 (offering a general discussion of the difficulty of distinguishing between acceptable “persuasion” of another state and unlawful “coercion”).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW91 Thus, an intervention is unlawful when the aim is to deprive the target state of its discretion to decide freely on issues related to its internal or external affairs.¹⁵⁷ As DeWitt Dickinson indicated in 1920, intervention is prohibited when it “cannot be terminated at the pleasure of the state that is subject to the intervention.”¹⁵⁸ Coercion, thus, merely requires that the target state is unable to respond to the outside interference and is therefore forced to tolerate it, irrespective of whether this tolerance is due to inability or lack of awareness. In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 excludes from the prohibition all activities by the intervening state of which the target state is not aware. This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW93 argument is similarly unconvincing. Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵ For an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 In summary, intervention is usually unlawful when a state is targeting the internal affairs of another state and thereby employing methods that the target state cannot\"terminate at its pleasure\"¹⁸⁰ and therefore are coercive. It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law. In order to reach a definitive verdict, however, it also needs to be ascertained that the intervening state was not acting within its rights under public international law when resorting to coercion.\n## Prohibited interventions in other states' elections\"In addition, I would be in favor of legislation prohibiting interference with the electoral processes in other countries.\"¹⁸¹ Cyrus Vance thus expressed his wish for US legislation outlawing foreign election meddling. The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared: Incontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law....\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW95 the purpose of influencing American public opinion on a political question.¹⁸³ Elections determine a people’s “choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy,” a decision which, according to the ICJ, must remain free.¹⁸⁴ There is, therefore, widespread agreement that a state’s electoral process is a matter within a state’s *domaine réservé* and is protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁸⁵ This protection is confirmed by numerous General Assembly resolutions that have stated that: [A]ny activities that attempt, directly or indirectly, to interfere in the free development of national electoral processes, in particular in the developing countries, or that are intended to sway the results of such processes, violate the spirit and letter of the principles established in the Charter and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.¹⁸⁶ Furthermore, the fact that intervenors often seem to succeed in influencing target-state election results,¹⁸⁷ thereby securing for themselves a say in choosing a target state’s government, renders any contrary arguments unconvincing. As Ray Meyer has pointed out, such an intervention, if successful, can result in “an inherently more extensive intervention in internal affairs because it may involve an indirect intervention in all future policy decisions made by the tainted INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 government.”¹⁸⁸ ## Persuasion Accordingly, the main emphasis of legal analysis must focus on whether the intervenor employed coercive means in order to achieve the desired election result.¹⁸⁹ As indicated earlier, the attempt by one state to persuade another state’s electorate to vote in a specific way is lawful under public international law.¹⁹⁰ What differentiates lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is the decision on the part of the meddling state, in the former case, to forego coercive methods. Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³ ## Deception and Manipulation Such interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW97 reports and editorials or posting political views on social media under the guise of being a target-state citizen is thus unlawful.¹⁹⁵ The difference from the situation described above hinges on the definition of coercion: this kind of deceit leaves the target state defenseless against the foreign intervention. The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰ If the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 similarly subversive.²⁰³ ## Disseminating false or true information Having thus identified the line where lawful persuasion becomes unlawful intervention, it is obvious that more serious activities, such as spreading fake news or forging documents in order to influence the target state's election outcome, are clearly unlawful.²⁰⁴ Although spreading disinformation may possibly lead to a target-state response, the intervenor's intention is to avoid an effective target-state reaction and to deceive that state's electorate. A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations. The intervenor's intention to avoid scrutiny and ward off any reaction on the target state's part makes the interference coercive.\nAs far as the spreading of true information gained by way of MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW99 espionage is concerned, this, too, constitutes unlawful intervention.²⁰⁸ Illicitly gained information is instrumentalized in order to influence the target state’s election results in a meaningful way.²⁰⁹ The fact that the information was gained by way of espionage taints the dissemination of the information. The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹ What remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 ## Funding political parties and/or candidates Funding parties or candidates and their election campaigns in another state, the most favored form of foreign intervention,²¹⁴ is unlawful.²¹⁵ The unlawfulness is particularly obvious when foreign funding of parties and candidates is prohibited in the target state.²¹⁶ In this context, funding is meant to include the training of target-state citizens in campaigning or producing campaigning materials for the preferred candidate. Here, too, the target state is unable to terminate the intervention at its pleasure. By enabling the preferred politicians to outspend their rivals—often by wide margins²¹⁷—the intervenor clearly is attempting to install a government favorable to its own goals that may well even be beholden to it due to the support received.\n## Intrusion on the electoral process itself The most severe kind of intervention in the sphere of election meddling is, of course, the manipulation of the electoral process itself.²¹⁸ Changing election results; making ballots disappear; deleting or adding names to the electoral register; or manipulating electronic voting machines, the\"electoral doomsday scenario,\"²¹⁹ are undoubtedly coercive in nature.²²⁰ The target state is not meant to notice the manipulation MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW101 and is therefore unable to terminate the intervention and the manipulation. If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications The possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵ Irrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the Cyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L. STUD. 549, 561 (2020); Gill, supra note 135, at 234.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 intervenor be targeting an electoral process in support of “democratic” forces in an insufficiently democratic environment, the intervention could possibly be justified on those grounds.²²⁷ On the other hand, the intervention in a “democratic” electoral process could not be justified under international law.²²⁸ Almost needless to say, such a view cannot be reflective of current customary international law, as many states have never been able to lay claim to being a “democracy.”²²⁹ In fact, currently it seems that “democracy” is in retreat, with many societies seemingly preferring stability to democracy.²³⁰ It is therefore highly unlikely that these states would accept a rule in international law according to which an intervention in their electoral processes would be justified, but not vice versa.²³¹ Furthermore, such a hypothetical rule of international law is unsurprisingly bound to be seen as self-serving: a reversion to western exceptionalism on the basis of a putative rule that just so happens to justify Western behavior while protecting Western societies against similar actions.²³² Lastly, the ICJ, too, has in the past ²²⁷.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk, MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103 rejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared: It [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention[233]... The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.[234] ## Economic Measures Nevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful.

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW105 consequences or the promise of economic benefits, as well as the intervening state's conduct, are arguably facts that voters should be considering when casting their vote.\n## Summary A state is free to interfere during another state's election campaign as long as its intent is persuasive rather than coercive. Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016 Applied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 the efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY Intervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of\"sovereignty\"as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty:\"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW107 dispute between the Netherlands and the United States concerning sovereignty over an island, the arbitrator at the Permanent Court of Arbitration explained that sovereignty “signifies independence. Independence, with regards to a portion of the globe, is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”246 There is widespread agreement that a violation of another state’s sovereignty is unlawful under public international law.247 Only very recently, the United Kingdom has sought to call this long-standing view into question by arguing that respect for another state’s sovereignty was not a rule of, but only a principle in, international law.248 Quite rightly, the United Kingdom so far has received very little official support from other states for this questionable line of argument.249 In fact, some International Law, in THE FOURTH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASIAN SOCIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 1, 5 (2013); Schmitt, supra note 10, at 43.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 states have since then rejected the UK's view.²⁵⁰ In 2020, NATO member states also confirmed that sovereignty is a primary rule of international law.²⁵¹ International courts have consistently taken that view,²⁵² as have other states.²⁵³ Some of the activities associated with election meddling are not only prohibited interventions in the internal affairs of another state but also violations of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁴ If the interventions described above are, for example, organized or carried out by the intervenor's embassy or consulate staff on the territory of the target state, then these activities will regularly be not only prohibited interventions but also violations of the target state's territorial sovereignty. For example, a state handing over money to political parties on the target state's territory will be exercising its governmental functions there and thus violating the other state's sovereignty.\nout that no state accused of violating another state's sovereignty had claimed to be entitled to do so); under the Obama Administration, the United States adopted the view that violating another state's sovereignty was unlawful: see Harald Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Sept. 18, 2012); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm; Brian J. Egan, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Nov. 10, 2016); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/264303.htm; see also Rep. Group Governmental Experts on Dev. Field Info. &amp; Telecommunications Context of Int'l Sec. (22 July 2015), UN Doc. A/70/174, ¶ 27, 28 (b); Schmitt, supra note 220, at 554–55.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW109 Similarly, the manipulation of voting machines located on the target state's territory, whether remotely or not, will violate the target state's sovereignty, as the target state's governmental authority is being usurped.²⁵⁵ Some forms of cyber activity, such as the hacking of e-mails stored on servers located within the target state's territory, will also involve an unlawful disregard of that state's sovereignty.²⁵⁶ Nevertheless, basing the unlawfulness of election meddling solely on the violation of the target state's sovereignty has significant drawbacks, as many of the interventions described above would consequently be lawful.²⁵⁷ If a state funds a foreign political party or candidate with the potential effect of massively influencing the outcome of the target state's election, there are many possible scenarios that do not involve a violation of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁸ Basically, it would be sufficient to hand over any monies on the intervenor's territory to avoid any violation of international law. Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰ In summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty. Therefore, the prohibition on violating other states' sovereignty is less relevant to the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 discussion of election meddling than the prohibition on interventions in the internal matters of other states.\n## THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION More recently, Jens David Ohlin has suggested another line of argument. According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³ This line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸ Although the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW111 independent state.²⁷⁰ However, that right of self-determination of a people in an existent state is already protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁷¹ The prohibition on coercive interventions in matters that each state can decide freely also serves to protect that state's people's right of self-determination.²⁷² As the ICJ has explained, an intervention is unlawful when it bears on matters such as\"the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.\"²⁷³ As James Crawford has explained,\"Where a self-determination unit is a State, the principle of self-determination is represented by the rule against intervention in the internal affairs of that State, and in particular in the choice of the form of government of the State.\"²⁷⁴ Thus, prohibited interventions are interventions that (also) violate the target-state people's right of self-determination.²⁷⁵ Furthermore, Ohlin's arguments have little prospect of acceptance as a rule of customary international law due to their implied reliance on the target state's\"democratic\"structures. Ohlin does not explore what the term\"democracy\"means in public international law. Is a state a democracy simply because there are competing parties and voters are permitted to cast ballots?²⁷⁶ Developments in states such as Iraq, Libya, INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 or Afghanistan imply that these criteria are not sufficient.²⁷⁷ What about a state, such as Hungary, that some refer to as an “illiberal democracy”?²⁷⁸ Indeed, some may claim doubts on whether the will of the people is properly reflected in an electoral system that enables a president to be elected against the wishes of the majority of voters, as is possible in the United States.²⁷⁹ Do recent changes to the electoral system in a number of states in the United States (changes which, according to some, are potentially disenfranchising large sections of the electorate),²⁸⁰ possibly mean that the US is no longer protected against outside intervention? Others may question whether a political system that has for decades produced majority governments—based on the support of as little as 35% of voters,²⁸¹ and whose parliamentary system includes a wholly appointed upper chamber,²⁸² as is the case in the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW113 UK—is truly “democratic.” Is it therefore really legitimate to solely exclude states’ political processes from international law’s protection solely because they bar some candidates often favored in the West?²⁸³ Such a view would seem to contradict what the ICJ had to say on interventions based on promoting democracy: “The court cannot contemplate the creation of a new rule opening up a right of intervention by one State against another on the grounds that the latter has opted for some particular ideology or political system.”²⁸⁴ By ignoring these issues, Ohlin’s line of argument runs the risk of being dismissed as both biased and premised on the idea of Western exceptionalism. Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵ and bishops of the Church of England).

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n## CONCLUSION This article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW115 can be classified as “methods of coercion.” The term “coercion” obviously excludes from the prohibition means of persuasion.²⁸⁹ Therefore, it is, for example, not unlawful for a state to publicly state its preferences as to the outcome of an election in another state.²⁹⁰ The interfering state is thereby simply advocating an outcome that it believes to be in its national interest. The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³ However, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 are concerned. Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication, ²⁹⁴.

Res. 2734 (XXV) ¶ 4, Declaration on International Security (Dec. 16, 1970). But see Ohlen, supra note 10, at 67–89 (viewing the prohibition on interventions as protecting only a state's sovereignty). However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117 seems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or\"democratic\"exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domaine réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses.

However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects. In this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct. ## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater.

In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10"

TERRY*\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections. . . . If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves. . . .¹\nFollowing the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, there has been noticeable interest in the lawfulness of foreign interference in another state's elections under public international law. The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n* Patrick C.

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵\nWhy, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n3. DOV H. LEVIN, MEDDLING IN THE BALLOT BOX: THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF PARTISAN ELECTORAL INTERVENTIONS 4 (2020).\n4. See id. at 3, 50, 158–60. For his research, Levin classified the following activities as “intervention”: “[p]rovision of campaign funds,” “[p]ublic and specific threats,” “[t]raining locals . . . in advanced campaigning,” “[d]issemination of scandalous exposés/disinformation,” “[d]esigning . . . of campaigning materials,” “[s]udden . . . provision of foreign aid or a significant increase,” and “[w]ithdrawal of part or whole of aid.” Id. at 51.

This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸\nThe analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰\n⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\nSecondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or\ncomplexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73\norganization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with. Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty. And indeed, very often\n11. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination. I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES\nRussia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.\nIn this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the\n13. OHLIN, supra note 10, at 91, 97-104.\n14.

In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government. This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe. As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations. To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties. Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy. The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election varies between $1 million and $10\n15.

In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57\n## Further Examples\nAs these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US \"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to \"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this, \"the CIA mounted a massive [. . . ]\n56.

Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States \"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\" the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely \"acquiesc[ed]\" to the US demand for an election. Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate. President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome. Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.\nIn 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections. During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance. US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won. Furthermore, the CIA \"leaked damaging information\" claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.\nRole of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n76.

Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention:\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷\nThus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted . . .\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

Rather, the intervenor must employ \"methods of coercion\" to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To \"persuade\" has been defined as \"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴\nHowever, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term \"coercion\" in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to \"methods of coercion\" severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited\n138.

There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible.

In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This\n157.

This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This\n165.

Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵\nFor an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹\n172.

It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law. In order to reach a definitive verdict, however, it also needs to be ascertained that the intervening state was not acting within its rights under public international law when resorting to coercion.\n## Prohibited interventions in other states' elections\n\"In addition, I would be in favor of legislation prohibiting interference with the electoral processes in other countries.\"¹⁸¹\nCyrus Vance thus expressed his wish for US legislation outlawing foreign election meddling. The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared:\nIncontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law. . . .\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for\n180.

Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³\n## Deception and Manipulation\nSuch interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in\n188.

The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰\nIf the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore\n195.

A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations. The intervenor's intention to avoid scrutiny and ward off any reaction on the target state's part makes the interference coercive.\nAs far as the spreading of true information gained by way of\n203.

In Wheatley's view, spreading true information can be unlawful if \"all other voices are drowned out.\" If such information is disseminated on the eve of an election, this results in other voices being drowned out because they cannot respond before the election takes place.\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW99\nespionage is concerned, this, too, constitutes unlawful intervention.²⁰⁸ Illicitly gained information is instrumentalized in order to influence the target state’s election results in a meaningful way.²⁰⁹ The fact that the information was gained by way of espionage taints the dissemination of the information. The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹\nWhat remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n208.

If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications\nThe possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵\nIrrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the\nCyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk,\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103\nrejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared:\nIt [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention. . . The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.\n## Economic Measures\nNevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful.

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic\n235. See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 28–29; but see Helal, supra note 10, at 81–82 (stating such economic measures are not coercive as long as they are not combined with other, unlawful measures in order to achieve the intervenor’s goals).\n236. See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 29–30; Watts, supra note 10, at 12–13; but see Helal, supra note 10, at 7, 62–64, 81–84, 85–86. In Helal’s view, withdrawing or granting benefits in order to achieve a specific election result –though generally lawful– becomes unlawful, if such actions are combined with other unlawful means. He views such a strategy as a composite breach of the non-intervention rule. Less convincingly, he argues that such economic measures merely amount to “persuasion” if not combined with unlawful means. Helal, supra note 10, at 81. For example, Helal views the hacking of the emails circulating among the leadership of Democratic Party and their subsequent publication in order to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election as unlawful. Had Russia at the same time threatened to impose sanctions on the United States, these sanctions would have therefore been rendered unlawful. Had Russia, on the other hand, only threatened the United States with the imposition of sanctions in the case of a Clinton victory, that, in his view, would have been lawful. A potentially extremely coercive measure’s legality (imposition of sanctions) would thus depend on whether the intervenor resorted to other, potentially minor, but unlawful means of intervention, which is not convincing. See also Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention on the Internal Affairs of States, UN GA Res. 36/103 (1981), op. para. II (k). However, it is very doubtful that the resolution reflected customary international law, as many western states opposed the resolution. See Jamnejad, Wood, supra note 138, at 355 n.32.\n237.

Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016\nApplied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\nthe efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY\nIntervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of \"sovereignty\" as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty: \"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a\n240.

The Department of Defense General Counsel, Paul C. Ney, Jr., stated that the US position “share[d] some similarities with the view expressed by the U.K. Government in 2018”.

Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰\nIn summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty.

According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³\nThis line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸\nAlthough the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an\n262.

Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it does not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory.

Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵\nand bishops of the Church of England).

Such disagreements could concern many issues of philosophy and practice – for example, single member districts versus at-large election, runoffs, proportional representation of minority parties . . .” possibly offering an intervenor many arguments in order to justify excluding a specific (target) state from its own understanding of democracy.\n284.

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n## CONCLUSION\nThis article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions\n286.

The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³\nHowever, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters\n289.

Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication,\n²⁹⁴.

However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117\nseems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or \"democratic\" exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory.

If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves. . . .¹\nFollowing the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, there has been noticeable interest in the lawfulness of foreign interference in another state's elections under public international law. The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n* Patrick C.

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵ Why, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71 In order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸ The analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰ ⁸.

L.J. 31, 40 (2018) (stating how recent cases of intervention do not have evidence of coercion and thus prohibitions on intervention cannot prevent them); Stephen Townley, Intervention's Idiosyncrasies: The Need for a New Approach to Understanding Sub-Forcible Intervention, 42 FORDHAM INT'L L.J. 1167, 1190–93 (2019) (discussing the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 Secondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or complexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73 organization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 election meddling will also result in a violation of another state's sovereignty. However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES Russia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14] In this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater. Although the US intervention in the Italian election occurred almost seventy years before the Russians meddled in the US election, it is the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW75 former intervention that was more intrusive and likely more successful.\n## US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 The Italian parliamentary election of 1948 was an early milestone in foreign election meddling. In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10 INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 million.²² Such generosity enabled the anti-Communist parties to spend 7.5 times more on the election campaign than the Communists.²³ This generosity was accompanied by a massive propaganda campaign that highlighted Soviet activities in Eastern Europe.²⁴ Pamphlets were produced that targeted Communist politicians' personal lives.²⁵ Letters allegedly from members of the Communist Party were forged and published widely.²⁶ Voice of America regularly broadcast US propaganda, as did various commercial radio stations with the support of the US State Department.²⁷ A massive letter-writing campaign was organized whereby Americans of Italian extraction were encouraged to write to their relatives in Italy to discourage them from voting for the Communists. At first written by Italian Americans themselves, these letters were soon mass-produced and only required an address and a signature.²⁸ Around ten million of such letters were sent to Italy.²⁹ On the other hand, the United States publicly threatened to reduce or stop any economic assistance should the Communists be elected, while promising to increase such aid in the event of the emergence of a government excluding the Communist Party.³⁰ Furthermore, the United States threatened to bar all Italians who were members of the Communist Party from entering the United States.³¹ There was some British assistance in support of US election interference.³² In the British Embassy in Rome, a committee was formed to organize covert election meddling.³³ To guarantee more favorable https://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=1&amp;year=1948 (last visited Jan. 29, 2022) (calculating that $1 in 1948 equals around $11.13 in 2021).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW77 reporting in Italian newspapers, journalists were bribed.³⁴ Unattributable papers were distributed to influence the electorate.³⁵ The greatest British triumph probably was the creation of the popular Don Camillo and Peppone series about a Communist mayor and a Catholic priest.³⁶ Nevertheless, due to financial restraints, the British effort was minor in comparison to US involvement.³⁷ US intervention in Italy might have become much more far-reaching had the Communists won the election. In some circles within the US government, there were debates on whether to intervene militarily or support a coup carried out by Italian military forces should the Communist Party emerge victorious from the elections.³⁸ In the end, the party supported by the United States, the Christian Democrats, won the 1948 parliamentary elections.³⁹ This was mainly or at least partly due, many believe, to the United States' massive involvement in the election campaign.⁴⁰ ## Russian intervention in the U.S. election of 2016 In early 2016, the Russian government and figures associated with the Russian government began to prepare their campaign of interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States. The aim of Russian meddling was to help defeat the Democratic Party candidate, the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton—who was perceived as being very critical of the Russian government—and to support the election of the Republican Party candidate, Donald Trump.⁴¹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 According to US authorities, Russia also sought to sow discord among Americans⁴² and to generally undermine public trust in the US electoral process and system of government.⁴³ To achieve this, the Russia-based Internet Research Agency (IRA), which according to the US government was “tasked” to do this by the Russian government,⁴⁴ bought advertisements supportive of Trump, or his policies, on social media sites, such as Facebook.⁴⁵ Moreover, in order to achieve its goal, fictitious Facebook,⁴⁶ Instagram,⁴⁷ and Twitter accounts were created.⁴⁸ Overall, the IRA was responsible for more than 61,500 posts on Facebook, more than 116,000 posts on Instagram, and more than 10.4 million tweets on Twitter.⁴⁹ In all of these instances, the IRA’s authorship was not acknowledged. Rather, the aim was to create the impression that these were messages posted by US citizens.⁵⁰ According to one estimate, the Russian-inspired Facebook posts reached 126 million users.⁵¹ Many of these posts were also successful in instigating actual US citizens to take further action, such as forwarding the posts to acquaintances.⁵² The IRA also used its social media presence to promote Trump rallies.⁵³ In addition, Russian news sites and television channels, such as RT and Sputnik, regularly broadcast material that was supportive of Trump and critical of Clinton.⁵⁴ Furthermore, Russia initiated the hacking of email accounts of persons in the Democratic Party leadership who were associated with Hillary Clinton.⁵⁵ These emails, which were damaging to the Clinton campaign, were subsequently published by WikiLeaks, allegedly in note 10, at 186.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW79 cooperation with Russian government circles.56 As is well known, the candidate the Russian government supported, Donald Trump, was victorious in the 2016 presidential election. In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57 ## Further Examples As these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US\"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to\"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this,\"the CIA mounted a massive [... ] INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 propaganda campaign\"62 that in the end resulted in\"24 daily newscasts in Santiago and the provinces, 26 weekly 'commentary' programs, and... 3,000 posters daily.\"63 The CIA concluded that this campaign was decisive in securing a majority for the favored candidate, Eduardo Frei.64 The United States also intervened in the congressional elections of 1965 and 1969 by providing campaign funding and producing propaganda.65 In 1965, nine of the twenty-two candidates supported by the CIA were elected;66 in 1969, ten of twelve.67 The Senate Report concludes that these CIA efforts were\"relatively successful\"and produced a\"substantial cumulative effect over these years.\"68 During the election campaign for the presidential election in 1970, the United States again interfered on a grand scale: although there was hardly any direct funding of political parties,69 the CIA once more launched a\"massive propaganda campaign.\"70 This included\"black propaganda\"in order to undermine the leftist coalition, a\"newsletter\"sent to\"journalists, academicians, politicians,\"and editorials, as well as radio broadcasts.71 In this instance, however, US involvement could not prevent the leftist candidate, Salvador Allende, from winning a plurality in the election.72 Subsequently, the United States unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Chile's Congress from confirming Salvador Allende as President.73 Political statements to that effect were issued, a new propaganda campaign was launched, economic pressure was exerted, and signals were given to military officers and others that a coup would be acceptable to the United States.74 The US also intervened in other Latin American elections, mainly in the 1980s and 1990s.75 Two examples are the 1982 election in El MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW81 Salvador and the 1990 election in Nicaragua. Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States\"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\"the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely\"acquiesc[ed]\"to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79] In 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA\"leaked damaging information\"claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83] Role of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 The United States' preferred candidate won.\nMore recently, the United States has been accused of interfering in Russia's presidential election of 1996⁸⁴ and the parliamentary election of 2011.⁸⁵ Dov Levin has described US interference in Russia's 1996 presidential election in favor of Boris Yeltsin as\"one of the most massive electoral interventions recorded in [his] dataset,\"⁸⁶ which covers the period from 1946 to 2000. The US government seemed to believe that the deeply unpopular Yeltsin⁸⁷ was the only democratic candidate and that it was necessary to prevent the victory of the Communist Party candidate.⁸⁸ In a highly critical report, the Speaker's Special Advisory Group on Russia concluded in 2000 that the US government had\"pressur[ed]\"the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\"to grant $10.2 billion in credits to Russia\"and had thereby\"effectively used the Fund... to subsidize Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign.\"⁸⁹ Furthermore, US spin-doctors flew into Moscow to support Boris Yeltsin's campaign.⁹⁰ According to some reports, their work was decisive in securing his eventual victory.⁹¹ How closely these advisors were connected to the US government remains unclear.⁹² During the 2011 parliamentary election campaign, the Russian government accused the US of interference in order to undermine MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW83 Russia's then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Allegedly, the US government paid NGOs in Russia to discredit the Russian electoral process even before the election had taken place.⁹³ Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin condemned such activities and declared:\"When financing comes to some domestic organizations which are supposedly national, but which in fact work on foreign money and perform to the music of a foreign state during electoral processes, we need to safeguard ourselves from this interference in our internal affairs and defend our sovereignty.\"⁹⁴ Vladimir Putin subsequently also accused the United States of instigating the protests that erupted following the elections, during which claims of electoral fraud were made.⁹⁵ Past US activities therefore may help explain US President Barack Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"⁹⁶ Although the statement fell short of an explicit condemnation of Russia's conduct as unlawful,⁹⁷ it does at the same time also leave some room for interpreting the US stance in such a way.⁹⁸ Russia, too, has been accused of meddling in other states' elections on numerous other occasions—for example, in the UK's Brexit referendum in 2016⁹⁹ and its general election in 2019.¹⁰⁰ While the pro-Brexit UK government has so far refused to investigate claims that Russia interfered during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign in favor of the\"Leave\"campaign,¹⁰¹ many others agree that such Russian ⁹³.

Evans ed., 5th ed. 2018).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 confirmed that the Friendly Relations Resolution was “declaratory of customary international law.”¹³³ The ICJ itself had previously stressed the legal quality of the prohibition of such interventions: already in 1949, it declared interventions in other states’ affairs to be unlawful.¹³⁴ The prohibition on interventions in the internal or external affairs of another state therefore qualifies as a rule of customary international law.¹³⁵ The ICJ’s 1986 judgment in the Nicaragua case is frequently cited when discussing the prohibition of interventions because the court provided a partial definition of the prohibition’s scope. Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention: A prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷ Thus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements.

Rather, the intervenor must employ\"methods of coercion\"to achieve its aims.¹⁴¹ When analyzing the definition the ICJ provided, it becomes evident that acts of persuasion cannot be unlawful even when they concern other states' internal affairs.¹⁴² To\"persuade\"has been defined as\"to cause people to do or believe something, esp[ecially] by explaining why they should.\"¹⁴³ As persuasion therefore lacks the coercive element demanded by the ICJ, state activities that aim to persuade a target state (or its electorate) to take a specific course of action cannot amount to unlawful intervention.¹⁴⁴ However, distinguishing lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is not as straightforward as it might seem.¹⁴⁵ This confusion arises because there is disagreement on the definition of the term\"coercion\"in international law.¹⁴⁶ Some claim the ICJ's reference to\"methods of coercion\"severely limits the scope of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁴⁷ According to this view, intervention is only prohibited INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 when the level of coercion is comparable to the threat to use force.¹⁴⁸ The inaccuracy of this view becomes obvious when some claim that coercive intervention must be “dictatorial” in nature, leaving the target state with no room for maneuver,¹⁴⁹ and that coercion requires the target state to be fully aware of its being coerced.¹⁵⁰ This very limited view of prohibited interventions is unconvincing.¹⁵¹ When partially defining the term “nonintervention,” the ICJ stressed it was only looking at “those aspects of the principle which appear to be relevant” to the case before it.¹⁵² The court was dealing with the United States’ massive support of the Nicaraguan rebels, the Contras, who were attempting to overthrow their country’s government by force. There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible. Rather, the difference between coercive intervention and permissible persuasion comes down to whether the target state retains its freedom to choose in matters related to its independence as a state.¹⁵⁶ supra note 138 (offering a general discussion of the difficulty of distinguishing between acceptable “persuasion” of another state and unlawful “coercion”).\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW91 Thus, an intervention is unlawful when the aim is to deprive the target state of its discretion to decide freely on issues related to its internal or external affairs.¹⁵⁷ As DeWitt Dickinson indicated in 1920, intervention is prohibited when it “cannot be terminated at the pleasure of the state that is subject to the intervention.”¹⁵⁸ Coercion, thus, merely requires that the target state is unable to respond to the outside interference and is therefore forced to tolerate it, irrespective of whether this tolerance is due to inability or lack of awareness. In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 excludes from the prohibition all activities by the intervening state of which the target state is not aware. This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW93 argument is similarly unconvincing. Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵ For an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹ INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 In summary, intervention is usually unlawful when a state is targeting the internal affairs of another state and thereby employing methods that the target state cannot\"terminate at its pleasure\"¹⁸⁰ and therefore are coercive. It is not necessary for the interference to be dictatorial in nature, nor need the state be aware of its being coerced. Furthermore, the success of the intervention is not a valid criterion under public international law. In order to reach a definitive verdict, however, it also needs to be ascertained that the intervening state was not acting within its rights under public international law when resorting to coercion.\n## Prohibited interventions in other states' elections\"In addition, I would be in favor of legislation prohibiting interference with the electoral processes in other countries.\"¹⁸¹ Cyrus Vance thus expressed his wish for US legislation outlawing foreign election meddling. The United States itself has long been intolerant of foreign interference in its political deliberations; to combat just such foreign meddling, the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938.¹⁸² Explaining why it deemed the FARA necessary, the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives declared: Incontrovertible evidence has been submitted to prove that there are many persons in the United States representing foreign governments or foreign political groups, who are supplied by such foreign agencies with funds and other materials to foster un-American activities, and to influence the external and internal policies of this country, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of international law....\nThis required registration will publicize the nature of subversive or other similar activities so that the American people may know those who are engaged in this country by foreign agencies to spread doctrines alien to our democratic form of government, or propaganda for MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW95 the purpose of influencing American public opinion on a political question.¹⁸³ Elections determine a people’s “choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy,” a decision which, according to the ICJ, must remain free.¹⁸⁴ There is, therefore, widespread agreement that a state’s electoral process is a matter within a state’s *domaine réservé* and is protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁸⁵ This protection is confirmed by numerous General Assembly resolutions that have stated that: [A]ny activities that attempt, directly or indirectly, to interfere in the free development of national electoral processes, in particular in the developing countries, or that are intended to sway the results of such processes, violate the spirit and letter of the principles established in the Charter and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.¹⁸⁶ Furthermore, the fact that intervenors often seem to succeed in influencing target-state election results,¹⁸⁷ thereby securing for themselves a say in choosing a target state’s government, renders any contrary arguments unconvincing. As Ray Meyer has pointed out, such an intervention, if successful, can result in “an inherently more extensive intervention in internal affairs because it may involve an indirect intervention in all future policy decisions made by the tainted INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 government.”¹⁸⁸ ## Persuasion Accordingly, the main emphasis of legal analysis must focus on whether the intervenor employed coercive means in order to achieve the desired election result.¹⁸⁹ As indicated earlier, the attempt by one state to persuade another state’s electorate to vote in a specific way is lawful under public international law.¹⁹⁰ What differentiates lawful persuasion from unlawful intervention is the decision on the part of the meddling state, in the former case, to forego coercive methods. Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³ ## Deception and Manipulation Such interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW97 reports and editorials or posting political views on social media under the guise of being a target-state citizen is thus unlawful.¹⁹⁵ The difference from the situation described above hinges on the definition of coercion: this kind of deceit leaves the target state defenseless against the foreign intervention. The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰ If the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 similarly subversive.²⁰³ ## Disseminating false or true information Having thus identified the line where lawful persuasion becomes unlawful intervention, it is obvious that more serious activities, such as spreading fake news or forging documents in order to influence the target state's election outcome, are clearly unlawful.²⁰⁴ Although spreading disinformation may possibly lead to a target-state response, the intervenor's intention is to avoid an effective target-state reaction and to deceive that state's electorate. A more difficult issue to address is whether spreading true information is similarly unlawful.²⁰⁵ Whether such activities are unlawful is dependent on how the information was obtained and when it was disseminated. No matter how the information was obtained, it is unlawful for a foreign state to intentionally disseminate true information on the eve of an election²⁰⁶ with the aim of preventing a meaningful response on the part of the target state or its politicians in order to influence the outcome of the target state's elections.²⁰⁷ After all, even correct information can be taken out of context or instrumentalized in order to insinuate false allegations. The intervenor's intention to avoid scrutiny and ward off any reaction on the target state's part makes the interference coercive.\nAs far as the spreading of true information gained by way of MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW99 espionage is concerned, this, too, constitutes unlawful intervention.²⁰⁸ Illicitly gained information is instrumentalized in order to influence the target state’s election results in a meaningful way.²⁰⁹ The fact that the information was gained by way of espionage taints the dissemination of the information. The intervenor’s intent to manipulate the outcome of the election, and to therefore intervene in the target state’s internal affairs by using the material obtained by deceit and manipulation, causes the act of espionage to be unlawful.²¹⁰ Here, too, the target state is not able to terminate either the espionage or the subsequent dissemination of the information, which makes such actions coercive in nature.²¹¹ What remains is the dissemination—in a timely manner—of true information gained by lawful means. If, for example, the relevant information can be found in open sources (such as a candidate’s old posts on Facebook) it is lawful for the interfering state to spread such information, although such action may well have a noticeable impact on the election outcome in the target state.²¹² This is due to the fact that such action is persuasive in nature—the intervenor is utilizing lawfully obtained material in order to persuade target-state voters to vote in a specific way.²¹³ As dissemination in a timely manner is a prerequisite, both the target state and the target state’s politicians have the opportunity to respond to any possible allegations.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 ## Funding political parties and/or candidates Funding parties or candidates and their election campaigns in another state, the most favored form of foreign intervention,²¹⁴ is unlawful.²¹⁵ The unlawfulness is particularly obvious when foreign funding of parties and candidates is prohibited in the target state.²¹⁶ In this context, funding is meant to include the training of target-state citizens in campaigning or producing campaigning materials for the preferred candidate. Here, too, the target state is unable to terminate the intervention at its pleasure. By enabling the preferred politicians to outspend their rivals—often by wide margins²¹⁷—the intervenor clearly is attempting to install a government favorable to its own goals that may well even be beholden to it due to the support received.\n## Intrusion on the electoral process itself The most severe kind of intervention in the sphere of election meddling is, of course, the manipulation of the electoral process itself.²¹⁸ Changing election results; making ballots disappear; deleting or adding names to the electoral register; or manipulating electronic voting machines, the\"electoral doomsday scenario,\"²¹⁹ are undoubtedly coercive in nature.²²⁰ The target state is not meant to notice the manipulation MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW101 and is therefore unable to terminate the intervention and the manipulation. If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications The possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵ Irrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the Cyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L. STUD. 549, 561 (2020); Gill, supra note 135, at 234.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 intervenor be targeting an electoral process in support of “democratic” forces in an insufficiently democratic environment, the intervention could possibly be justified on those grounds.²²⁷ On the other hand, the intervention in a “democratic” electoral process could not be justified under international law.²²⁸ Almost needless to say, such a view cannot be reflective of current customary international law, as many states have never been able to lay claim to being a “democracy.”²²⁹ In fact, currently it seems that “democracy” is in retreat, with many societies seemingly preferring stability to democracy.²³⁰ It is therefore highly unlikely that these states would accept a rule in international law according to which an intervention in their electoral processes would be justified, but not vice versa.²³¹ Furthermore, such a hypothetical rule of international law is unsurprisingly bound to be seen as self-serving: a reversion to western exceptionalism on the basis of a putative rule that just so happens to justify Western behavior while protecting Western societies against similar actions.²³² Lastly, the ICJ, too, has in the past ²²⁷.

That no such distinction should be made is also implied by two former U.S. Presidents’ statements: President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan. President Ford seems to have taken a similar view as far as treating like things like. In a news conference, he was asked (referencing Chile): “Mr. President, under what international law do we have the right to destabilize the constitutionally elected government of another country. And does the Soviet Union have a similar right to destabilize the Government of Canada, for example, or the United States?” To this, President Ford responded: “I’m not going to pass judgment on whether it is permitted or authorized under international law. It’s a recognized fact that historically as well as presently, such actions are taken in the best interests of the countries involved.” Transcript of President’s News Conference on Foreign and Domestic Matters, N.Y. TIMES, Sept. 17, 1974; see also Richard A. Falk, MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW103 rejected such attempts at justifying interventions in other states' affairs. Responding to arguments put forward by the United States in order to justify its support of the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, the ICJ declared: It [the Court] has to consider whether there might be indications of a practice illustrative of belief in a kind of general right for States to intervene, directly or indirectly, with or without armed force, in support of an internal opposition in another State, whose cause appeared particularly worthy by reason of the political and moral values with which it was identified. For such a general right to come into existence would involve a fundamental modification of the customary law principle of non-intervention[233]... The Court therefore finds that no such general right of intervention, in support of an opposition within another State, exists in contemporary international law.[234] ## Economic Measures Nevertheless, one of the most coercive interventions in another state's electoral process remains lawful. The threat of economic sanctions or the promise of financial, trade, or other benefits should a particular government be elected can undoubtedly have an enormously President Gerald Ford, CIA Covert Operations, and the Status of International Law, 69 AM.

Based on their view that interventions in favor of self-determination should be viewed differently than other interventions, they conveniently conclude that U.S. interventions in Italy or Greece promoted self-determination, while the Soviet Union's interventions unfailingly achieved the opposite).\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 coercive effect.²³⁵ Voters threatened with severe economic consequences or enticed by the promise of a bright future may well be compelled to vote in a particular way. Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result. The threat of economic MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW105 consequences or the promise of economic benefits, as well as the intervening state's conduct, are arguably facts that voters should be considering when casting their vote.\n## Summary A state is free to interfere during another state's election campaign as long as its intent is persuasive rather than coercive. Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016 Applied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 the efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY Intervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of\"sovereignty\"as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty:\"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW107 dispute between the Netherlands and the United States concerning sovereignty over an island, the arbitrator at the Permanent Court of Arbitration explained that sovereignty “signifies independence. Independence, with regards to a portion of the globe, is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”246 There is widespread agreement that a violation of another state’s sovereignty is unlawful under public international law.247 Only very recently, the United Kingdom has sought to call this long-standing view into question by arguing that respect for another state’s sovereignty was not a rule of, but only a principle in, international law.248 Quite rightly, the United Kingdom so far has received very little official support from other states for this questionable line of argument.249 In fact, some International Law, in THE FOURTH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF THE ASIAN SOCIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 1, 5 (2013); Schmitt, supra note 10, at 43.\n\nINDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 states have since then rejected the UK's view.²⁵⁰ In 2020, NATO member states also confirmed that sovereignty is a primary rule of international law.²⁵¹ International courts have consistently taken that view,²⁵² as have other states.²⁵³ Some of the activities associated with election meddling are not only prohibited interventions in the internal affairs of another state but also violations of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁴ If the interventions described above are, for example, organized or carried out by the intervenor's embassy or consulate staff on the territory of the target state, then these activities will regularly be not only prohibited interventions but also violations of the target state's territorial sovereignty. For example, a state handing over money to political parties on the target state's territory will be exercising its governmental functions there and thus violating the other state's sovereignty.\nout that no state accused of violating another state's sovereignty had claimed to be entitled to do so); under the Obama Administration, the United States adopted the view that violating another state's sovereignty was unlawful: see Harald Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Sept. 18, 2012); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/197924.htm; Brian J. Egan, Legal Adviser, U.S. Department of State, Remarks on International Law and Stability in Cyberspace, U.S. DEP'T STATE (Nov. 10, 2016); https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/l/releases/remarks/264303.htm; see also Rep. Group Governmental Experts on Dev. Field Info. &amp; Telecommunications Context of Int'l Sec. (22 July 2015), UN Doc. A/70/174, ¶ 27, 28 (b); Schmitt, supra note 220, at 554–55.\n\nMEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW109 Similarly, the manipulation of voting machines located on the target state's territory, whether remotely or not, will violate the target state's sovereignty, as the target state's governmental authority is being usurped.²⁵⁵ Some forms of cyber activity, such as the hacking of e-mails stored on servers located within the target state's territory, will also involve an unlawful disregard of that state's sovereignty.²⁵⁶ Nevertheless, basing the unlawfulness of election meddling solely on the violation of the target state's sovereignty has significant drawbacks, as many of the interventions described above would consequently be lawful.²⁵⁷ If a state funds a foreign political party or candidate with the potential effect of massively influencing the outcome of the target state's election, there are many possible scenarios that do not involve a violation of the target state's sovereignty.²⁵⁸ Basically, it would be sufficient to hand over any monies on the intervenor's territory to avoid any violation of international law. Similarly, many of the cyber activities mentioned above, such as posting political messages under the guise of being a target-state citizen, cannot plausibly be argued to violate the target state's sovereignty so long as the activity is conducted from outside the target state's territory.²⁵⁹ Also, some forms of cyber espionage do not violate the target state's sovereignty, such as intercepting e-mails during transmission or obtaining e-mails stored on servers located outside of the target state's territory.²⁶⁰ In summary, although the violation of the target state's sovereignty is often implicated when discussing election meddling, there are many instances of such behavior that cannot be construed as interfering with the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁶¹ Furthermore, the reliance on a sovereignty violation also does not address the one issue the prohibition on interventions does not resolve: threatening economic consequences in the case of an unfavorable election outcome does not violate the target state's sovereignty but is rather an expression of the intervenor's sovereignty. Therefore, the prohibition on violating other states' sovereignty is less relevant to the INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 discussion of election meddling than the prohibition on interventions in the internal matters of other states.\n## THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION More recently, Jens David Ohlin has suggested another line of argument. According to him, election meddling, such as the actions the Russians are accused of in relation to the 2016 US presidential election, violates the collective right of self-determination of the target state's people.²⁶² By implication, Ohlin suggests that the prohibition of such actions may be limited to cases where the states targeted are democracies.²⁶³ This line of reasoning is not convincing for a number of reasons. Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸ Although the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW111 independent state.²⁷⁰ However, that right of self-determination of a people in an existent state is already protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁷¹ The prohibition on coercive interventions in matters that each state can decide freely also serves to protect that state's people's right of self-determination.²⁷² As the ICJ has explained, an intervention is unlawful when it bears on matters such as\"the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy.\"²⁷³ As James Crawford has explained,\"Where a self-determination unit is a State, the principle of self-determination is represented by the rule against intervention in the internal affairs of that State, and in particular in the choice of the form of government of the State.\"²⁷⁴ Thus, prohibited interventions are interventions that (also) violate the target-state people's right of self-determination.²⁷⁵ Furthermore, Ohlin's arguments have little prospect of acceptance as a rule of customary international law due to their implied reliance on the target state's\"democratic\"structures. Ohlin does not explore what the term\"democracy\"means in public international law. Is a state a democracy simply because there are competing parties and voters are permitted to cast ballots?²⁷⁶ Developments in states such as Iraq, Libya, INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 or Afghanistan imply that these criteria are not sufficient.²⁷⁷ What about a state, such as Hungary, that some refer to as an “illiberal democracy”?²⁷⁸ Indeed, some may claim doubts on whether the will of the people is properly reflected in an electoral system that enables a president to be elected against the wishes of the majority of voters, as is possible in the United States.²⁷⁹ Do recent changes to the electoral system in a number of states in the United States (changes which, according to some, are potentially disenfranchising large sections of the electorate),²⁸⁰ possibly mean that the US is no longer protected against outside intervention? Others may question whether a political system that has for decades produced majority governments—based on the support of as little as 35% of voters,²⁸¹ and whose parliamentary system includes a wholly appointed upper chamber,²⁸² as is the case in the MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW113 UK—is truly “democratic.” Is it therefore really legitimate to solely exclude states’ political processes from international law’s protection solely because they bar some candidates often favored in the West?²⁸³ Such a view would seem to contradict what the ICJ had to say on interventions based on promoting democracy: “The court cannot contemplate the creation of a new rule opening up a right of intervention by one State against another on the grounds that the latter has opted for some particular ideology or political system.”²⁸⁴ By ignoring these issues, Ohlin’s line of argument runs the risk of being dismissed as both biased and premised on the idea of Western exceptionalism. Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵ and bishops of the Church of England).

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n## CONCLUSION This article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian\"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW115 can be classified as “methods of coercion.” The term “coercion” obviously excludes from the prohibition means of persuasion.²⁸⁹ Therefore, it is, for example, not unlawful for a state to publicly state its preferences as to the outcome of an election in another state.²⁹⁰ The interfering state is thereby simply advocating an outcome that it believes to be in its national interest. The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³ However, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2 are concerned. Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication, ²⁹⁴.

Res. 2734 (XXV) ¶ 4, Declaration on International Security (Dec. 16, 1970). But see Ohlen, supra note 10, at 67–89 (viewing the prohibition on interventions as protecting only a state's sovereignty). However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW117 seems to want to limit the application of the right of self-determination to democracies as understood in mainly Western and allied societies. It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or\"democratic\"exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory. Thus, violating another state's sovereignty and intervening in its domaine réservé are both unlawful, but at times distinct offenses.

As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or \"democratic\" exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory.

    "# Voting by Proxy—Meddling in Foreign Elections and Public International Law\n\nPATRICK C. R. TERRY*\n\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections. . . . If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves. . . .¹\n\nFollowing the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, there has been noticeable interest in the lawfulness of foreign interference in another state's elections under public international law. The obvious lack of previous research on the issue is surprising, given that election meddling in other states has been a widespread practice since at least the end of World War II.² Indeed, according to Dov Levin, between 1946 and 2000, the United States and the Soviet Union (and Russia) alone were responsible for 117 partisan “electoral interventions”\n\n* Patrick C.

Based on his groundbreaking research on foreign interference in elections,⁴ Dov Levin has concluded, “I find such interference to have a significant impact in the desired direction in most situations, frequently in a magnitude sufficient to determine the identity of the winner.”⁵\n\nWhy, then, this sudden interest in the topic? Most likely, this is due to the fact that, for the first time in ages, the United States was the target of a meaningful information operation initiated abroad, with the goal of influencing the outcome of a presidential election.⁶ However, many instead have argued that new means of technology have made it necessary to analyze the legal situation in more detail—the way social media enables foreign governments to target an audience of millions by spreading fake or manipulated news stories.⁷ While there can be no doubt that the internet has changed the dimensions of what is possible as far as spreading propaganda or misinformation is concerned, it is, nevertheless, not correct to claim that the election meddling of the past was much less intrusive. Rather, considering the contemporary means at the disposal of both the target states and the foreign intervenors, past election meddling has at times been comparable, if not more intrusive, than the Russian actions in the run-up to the 2016 election in the United States. Rather than limiting the discussion to cyber meddling, it is therefore justified to examine the lawfulness of election meddling as a whole, irrespective of the technical means employed.\n\n3. DOV H. LEVIN, MEDDLING IN THE BALLOT BOX: THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF PARTISAN ELECTORAL INTERVENTIONS 4 (2020).\n4. See id. at 3, 50, 158–60.

    "MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW71\n\nIn order to illustrate that election meddling is a long-standing practice and that past instances evidenced interference on a massive scale, I will first describe two well-known examples of outside interference in more detail—the massive US intervention in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian interference in the US elections in 2016—before briefly turning to some other instances of alleged US and Russian election meddling. This will be followed by an in-depth analysis of the legality of foreign election meddling, which will conclude that the prohibition on interventions in the internal affairs of other states is the appropriate benchmark to decide whether a specific action by a state to interfere in another state's election was lawful or not.⁸\n\nThe analysis will necessitate a definition of what constitutes a prohibited intervention in the internal affairs of another state. Based on the partial definition the International Court of Justice (ICJ) provided,⁹ it needs to be established, firstly, whether the intervenor's aim was to influence matters that belong to the target state's protected internal affairs (domaine réservé). There is, however, widespread agreement that the process whereby a population chooses its government falls within the scope of the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.¹⁰\n\n⁸.

    "INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\n\nSecondly, for the intervention to be unlawful, it needs to be coercive. At what point mere interference morphs into a coercive intervention is very controversial. I will argue that, generally speaking, interference turns coercive when the target state cannot terminate the outside meddling at its pleasure. By differentiating lawful interference from possibly unlawful intervention, it will become obvious that states do have some leeway in trying to influence another state's voters. Even if this is irritating to the target state, it is, for example, acceptable for a foreign government to express its preferences as to who ought to win an election in another state so that official criticism of a foreign party's manifesto, or of statements made by foreign politicians, is similarly lawful. If, at the other end of the scale, the intervenor attempts to attack another state's election procedure by manipulating vote counts, deleting or adding voters to electoral registers, or otherwise disrupting the electoral process, then the threshold of a coercive intervention is undoubtedly met. In my view, the same is true when a state engages in funding preferred parties or candidates in another state.\n\nBut the threshold of intervention is also met, I will argue, when actions that may well only be judged as persuasive if clearly attributable to a foreign state are instead undertaken in a deceptive, manipulative way. For example, when a state pays off target-state journalists so that they write or broadcast comment pieces favorable to the intervenor's goals during an election campaign or initiates a campaign on social media, and thereby insinuates that the relevant posts were authored by target-state citizens, then that constitutes unlawful intervention. This is even more the case if the intervenor spreads fake news or engages in espionage to obtain information harmful to the disfavored candidate that is then published during an election campaign.\n\nIn these borderline cases, the difference between persuasion and intervention comes down to the deception. If a state openly articulates its preferences, the target state can react in all kinds of ways, and its citizens can evaluate the foreign state's statements in the proper context. The manipulative intrusion, on the other hand, robs the target state of the opportunity to react and serves to confuse the electorate that, for example, may well judge a fellow citizen's views differently than it would a foreign state's opinion. This difference is also the reason for the deception on the part of the intervenor. The intervening state does not want to be recognized as such, well aware that its views otherwise might well be dismissed by target-state voters and refuted by the target state itself. By posturing as a target-state citizen or\n\ncomplexities of domaine réservé and when it allows the prohibition of intervention).",
    "MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW73\n\norganization, the intervenor wants to prevent the target state from reacting, as there is no reason why a state should prohibit its citizens from expressing their views. The intervening state's conduct thus amounts to coercion because it actively participates in another state's election campaign in a way the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Furthermore, the intervening state cannot rely on any legal justification for its actions. Such actions are therefore unlawful interventions in the internal affairs of another state, whether successful or not.\n\nMy analysis of prohibited interventions will, however, also make the point that it is not always sufficient for an act to be coercive to be unlawful. Exceptionally, even a coercive intervention can be lawful if the means employed by the intervening state correspond with its sovereign right to decide its own external matters freely. For example, a state may threaten to impose economic sanctions on another state if a specific party is elected into power. Although frequently more coercive in effect than manipulating and deceiving voters during an election campaign, such a threat, nevertheless, is lawful, as there is still widespread agreement that it is at every state's discretion to decide the states it wants to do business with.[11] Furthermore, it is at least arguable that by announcing such measures before an election, the intervenor is providing target-state voters with factual information they may wish to consider when casting their vote.\n\nBefore concluding, I will briefly analyze other rules of public international law that may be implicated by election meddling and explain why I believe these rules are not as relevant to the discussion as the prohibition on interventions. Many authors argue that election meddling violates the target state's sovereignty.[12] And indeed, very often\n\n11. See Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicar. v.

However, it is also true that many of the actions described previously do not violate another state's sovereignty so that many of the intervenor's actions would be left unregulated. More recently, Jens Ohlin has suggested that election meddling violates the target-state population's collective right of self-determination.[13] I will briefly set out why I believe this to be unconvincing based on the fact that, in my view, the collective right of self-determination of peoples in already existent states is one of the rights the prohibition on interventions protects.\n\nIn this article, I will not deal with the issue of attribution of election meddling to states, which, certainly in the cyber realm, has at times become an almost insoluble problem. Furthermore, I will not discuss whether a state has the duty to stop private individuals from intervening in another state's elections. When actions of private individuals or companies are mentioned in this article, it will be assumed that the respective state instructed such private actors to undertake the intrusive actions described. Finally, as far as specific actions are attributed to specific states, I am relying on publicly available information. Obviously, I cannot judge whether the conclusions drawn as to a state's responsibility are correct.\n\n## ELECTION MEDDLING IN 1948 AND 2016 AND FURTHER EXAMPLES\n\nRussia's 2016 operation was simply the cyber-age version of standard United States practice for decades, whenever American officials were worried about a foreign vote.[14]\n\nIn this section, I will analyze two well-known examples of election meddling before summarizing some other instances of alleged US and Russian election interference. First, I will describe the US intervention in the Italian parliamentary election of 1948 before subsequently outlining Russian activities in the run-up to the US presidential election of 2016. This short chapter aims to show the various methods states employ in order to influence the outcome of elections in other states. This comparison will also serve to refute the argument that, due to the internet, the scope of election meddling has become much greater.

In the United States and elsewhere, there were fears that the Communist Party might win the forthcoming elections and be able to form a government.[15] This was seen as a potential major setback in the struggle against Soviet advances in Europe.[16] As a result, there was massive US intervention in the run-up to the election in support of the center-right parties, mainly the Christian Democrats, by means of overt economic aid and military support, as well as covert operations.[17] To that end, the United States engaged in massive funding of these parties.[18] Between 1948 and 1968, $65 million was spent on supporting center-right parties and individual politicians in Italy.[19] The estimate of the amount spent by the United States on the 1948 election[20] varies between $1 million[21] and $10\n\n15.

In his research on election meddling, Dov Levin concluded that Russian interference may well have been decisive in securing that outcome.57\n\n## Further Examples\n\nAs these two examples illustrate, states have been intervening in other states' elections for a long time. It is also not necessarily true that the possibilities of the internet have enabled states to intervene much more forcefully. The Italian example illustrates that it has always been possible to massively interfere in the electoral process of another state.\n\nThere have been many other examples that evidence this as well, such as US meddling in Latin America during the Cold War. Here, too, the US government sought to prevent the election of governments perceived as communist or socialist. Probably the most notorious US campaign in that respect took place in Chile. Beginning in the early 1960s, the United States became actively involved during election campaigns there. This involvement finally culminated in the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Chile, Salvador Allende,58 in 1973, once US covert actions to prevent such an election outcome had failed.\n\nThe US Senate Report on Covert Action in Chile concluded that the US \"was involved on a massive scale in the 1964 presidential election in Chile.\"59 The CIA spent more than three million dollars on the campaign, financing more than 50% of the favored centrist Christian Democrats' election campaign expenses.60 Some money was also channeled to the right-wing Radical Party and to \"private citizens' groups.\"61 In addition to this, \"the CIA mounted a massive [. . . ]\n\n56.

Following a coup and the eruption of civil war in the country, El Salvador held elections in 1982. According to one account, the United States \"planned, organised, funded, managed, and publicized\" the election in order to win international support for its policy of supporting right-leaning politicians in the country, while the state's government merely \"acquiesc[ed]\" to the US demand for an election.[76] Due to the conditions the incumbent government imposed as far as the election was concerned, leftist parties did not participate. Nevertheless, the United States decided to interfere and throw its weight behind the Christian Democrats' candidate in order to prevent the election of a right-wing candidate.[77] President Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and the US ambassador to El Salvador all issued statements supporting the Christian Democrats and implying that the granting of further aid was dependent on the election outcome.[78] Once the election did not end in the way the United States had hoped, it became heavily and successfully involved in Salvadorian efforts to form a government and choose its president by issuing public statements, exerting covert pressure, and withholding $100 million dollars in funds.[79]\n\nIn 1990, the United States directed its attention towards Nicaragua. In the election of that year, the incumbent government composed of the Sandinistas faced off against Violetta Chamorro, a conservative candidate. The United States had for many years supported the Contra rebels against the Sandinista government and wanted to ensure that movement's defeat in the upcoming elections.[80] During the election campaign, the United States spent $5 million on supporting parties within the opposition alliance.[81] US President George Bush Sr. and many members of Congress publicly endorsed the opposition candidate, and the US government declared that the trade embargo would be lifted if Chamorro won.[82] Furthermore, the CIA \"leaked damaging information\" claiming that the incumbent government was corrupt.[83]\n\nRole of the United States in El Salvador, 7 ASILS INT'L L.J. 89 (1983) (detailing the U.S.'s involvement in El Salvador's election from 1981 to 1983).\n76.

Reaffirming the principle of nonintervention as a rule of customary international law,¹³⁶ the ICJ went on to define a prohibited intervention:\n\nA prohibited intervention must accordingly be one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty to decide freely. One of these is the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy. Intervention is wrongful when it uses methods of coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones.¹³⁷\n\nThus, unlawful intervention consists of two elements. The intervenor must be targeting another state’s internal or external affairs or, as the ICJ phrased it, “matters in which each state is permitted . . .\n\nYost, said the resolution had “the precise job of enunciating that law” as far as non-intervention was concerned); see also Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, Advisory Opinion, 1996 I.C.J.

There was no need to explore the issue of “coercion” in any detail.¹⁵³ The United States’ involvement in the rebels’ use of force was undoubtedly coercive regarding Nicaragua’s system of government.¹⁵⁴ The fact that the ICJ did not provide a more concise definition of prohibited interventions,¹⁵⁵ therefore, does not mean that less coercive means are permissible.

However, the ILC repeatedly emphasized that this “narrow,” definition only applied “for the purpose of Article 18.” Id. at 69–70. Article 18’s scope is narrow as it only applies to the coercing state’s responsibility under international law for an unlawful act committed by the coerced state.

    "MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW91\n\nThus, an intervention is unlawful when the aim is to deprive the target state of its discretion to decide freely on issues related to its internal or external affairs.¹⁵⁷ As DeWitt Dickinson indicated in 1920, intervention is prohibited when it “cannot be terminated at the pleasure of the state that is subject to the intervention.”¹⁵⁸ Coercion, thus, merely requires that the target state is unable to respond to the outside interference and is therefore forced to tolerate it, irrespective of whether this tolerance is due to inability or lack of awareness. In both cases, the target state is robbed of its ability to defend itself against foreign meddling in its affairs.\n\nThis is a far more convincing definition than demanding “dictatorial interference” with the strong implication that an intervention needs to rise almost to the level of the use of force to be unlawful,¹⁵⁹ consequently allowing powerful foreign states to intervene in other states’ affairs as long as it could plausibly be claimed that the target state still retained some discretion, however hypothetical, to make a choice in its internal or external matters.¹⁶⁰ Applying the standard of “dictatorial interference,” even to the events in Nicaragua, arguably would result in the conclusion that the United States did not violate the prohibition on intervention. After all, the government of Nicaragua was able to resist the activities of both the United States and the Contras for many years.¹⁶¹ Consequently, it is arguable that the government of Nicaragua retained its freedom of choice.¹⁶² Furthermore, the term “intervention”—in contrast to, for example, imposition—implies the possibility of some discretion remaining on the part of the target state.¹⁶³ In summary, equating prohibited intervention with dictatorial interference is unacceptable if the prohibition on outside interventions is to have any meaning.\n\nSome claim that a state can only be coerced if it is aware of the intervenor’s activities and thus aware of its being coerced by it.¹⁶⁴ This\n\n157.

This, too, is an unnecessary and unconvincing limitation of the prohibition on interventions.¹⁶⁵ Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, this would imply that the US support of the Contras would have been lawful as long as Nicaragua was not aware of American activities and continued to blame the Contras' activities solely on this domestic opponent.¹⁶⁶ On the other hand, such activities would become unlawful the moment the target state became aware of the foreign intervenor's involvement. This unsatisfactory distinction between lawful and unlawful activities evidences that awareness on the part of the target state is not a suitable criterion to differentiate between lawful activities and unlawful coercion.¹⁶⁷ This is also confirmed by opinio juris: both the United States and the United Kingdom have declared that the manipulation of election results by cyber means is an unlawful intervention in the target state's internal affairs.¹⁶⁸ This view is widely supported,¹⁶⁹ but is incompatible with the view that a state must be aware of the coercion for the intervention to be unlawful.\n\nLastly, it is sometimes claimed that the prohibition on interventions is very difficult to apply in practice, as it often remains unclear whether the intervention was successful or not.¹⁷⁰ For example, some have argued that the Russian meddling in the US presidential election of 2016 cannot be judged as unlawful, as it remained uncertain whether these activities actually influenced the outcome of the election.¹⁷¹ This\n\n165.

    "MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW93\n\nargument is similarly unconvincing. Whether a state's actions are successful or not does not determine their lawfulness.¹⁷² Applied to the US activities in Nicaragua, such an understanding of unlawful interventions would require an assessment as to whether supporting the Contras' military campaign was successful in compelling the Nicaraguan government to comply with US demands.¹⁷³ Interpreting the prohibition in such a way would lead to an even greater proliferation of coercive interventions, as states would not be acting unlawfully as long as the intervention remained unsuccessful.¹⁷⁴ Failure or, as in the case of Russian election meddling, the lack of proof of a causal relationship between the intervention and its success would thus imply that the intervenor was acting lawfully. Such an interpretation is clearly inadequate.¹⁷⁵\n\nFor an intervention to be judged unlawful it is, nevertheless, not sufficient to conclude that the intervenor employed coercive methods. Even coercive interventions in another state's internal matters can be lawful as long as the intervenor resorts to means that he is entitled to under public international law. This phenomenon is especially true in the case of economic penalties and benefits. Though not entirely uncontroversial,¹⁷⁶ many view the unilateral imposition of sanctions against a target state as a lawful exercise of state sovereignty.¹⁷⁷ This imposition is even more justified when extending or withdrawing economic benefits to or from another state.¹⁷⁸ Every state has the right to decide whether it wants to initiate, continue, deepen, or rupture economic relations with another state.¹⁷⁹\n\n172.

Thus, it is perfectly acceptable for a state to criticize another state’s government or to publicly announce its preferences as to an election outcome in another state, including via its resident diplomats in the target state.¹⁹¹ The same is true of broadcasts on that state’s television and radio networks or reports and editorials in newspapers there, even if instigated by the intervening government.¹⁹² These criticisms or announcements are not in any way coercive, as the target state and the electorate can respond by, for example, rejecting or agreeing with the arguments put forward by the intervenor. Furthermore, the target state’s electorate is fully aware of the endorsement’s source and can evaluate it accordingly. Such actions lack a coercive element and are therefore lawful.¹⁹³\n\n## Deception and Manipulation\n\nSuch interference turns coercive, however, when methods of deception and manipulation are introduced into the equation.¹⁹⁴ Bribing target-state journalists to support the foreign government’s policies in\n\n188.

The target state cannot terminate it “at its pleasure” since target-state citizens or journalists are well within their rights when expressing their views publicly.¹⁹⁶ Furthermore, voters in the target state are misled into believing that the intervening country’s views are put forward by fellow citizens, and these voters will almost certainly pay more attention to such opinions than they would to easily identifiable foreign interference.¹⁹⁷ The intervenor’s activities, in truth, amount to nothing else but a secret election campaign in support of the preferred candidates. The strategy on the part of the intervening state demonstrates the coercive intent—it chooses to hide the origin of the views expressed in print, on air, or online in order to deceive the target state and its voters and to prevent the target state from responding.¹⁹⁸ The coercion towards the target state manifests itself in the intervening state’s active participation in another state’s election campaign, conducted in a way that the target state cannot prevent or terminate. As Dov Levin has concluded, “a covert intervention carries far lower chances of a backlash due to the inherent secrecy in the provision of the electoral aid.”¹⁹⁹ An overt intervention, on the other hand, may “lead to a backlash against the preferred candidate, hurting rather than helping their chances of being elected.”²⁰⁰\n\nIf the intervenor’s aim is not only to secure the preferred election outcome but also to undermine public trust in the electoral process more generally, as claimed in the case of the Russian meddling in the 2016 US election,²⁰¹ the coercive intent becomes even more obvious. The intervenor is seeking to subvert the target state’s system of government by way of deception, which renders the target state defenseless as long as the deception is not uncovered.²⁰² On the other hand, should the deception be uncovered, the public may well view an election outcome as illegitimate—in the belief that foreign meddling influenced the results—which undermines the public’s trust in its government and is therefore\n\n195.

If successful, this manipulation might well lead to the imposition of a government by outsiders, irrespective of the electorate's wishes. Short of the use of force, this amounts to the most coercive intrusion into another state's electoral process.\n\n## Preclusion of the intervention's wrongfulness / Justifications\n\nThe possibility, however, remains that the target state has granted its consent to the foreign intervention. It is widely agreed that valid consent precludes the intervention's wrongfulness.²²¹ In the context of election meddling, the question arises whether the governing party could grant such consent on behalf of the state to a foreign intervention intended to keep it in power. That is not the case. Generally, a government's consent on behalf of a state is sufficient.²²² Nevertheless, in such cases it is obvious to both sides, the governing party and the intervenor, that consent is not being granted on behalf of the state but on behalf of the political party that is in power at that moment.²²³ The officials tolerating or agreeing to such outside intervention are not acting as representatives of the state but rather as representatives of a political party.²²⁴ A political party's agreement, even if it should be the currently governing party, to outside intervention is therefore not sufficient to preclude the intervention's unlawfulness.²²⁵\n\nIrrespective of the foregoing legal analysis, some authors argue that the legality of interventions in another state's electoral process should also be judged according to the intervenor's goals.²²⁶ Should the\n\nCyber Capabilities and the International Law of Sovereignty and Intervention, 96 INT'L L.

Here, too, the target state is impotent, as it cannot force the intervenor to desist. Despite the coercive effects of such actions, they remain lawful.²³⁶ This is due to the fact that there is widespread agreement that the maintenance or rupture of economic relations with another state is at the discretion of each state.²³⁷ Of course, this is even truer as far as providing financial or other assistance is concerned.²³⁸ Although the intervenor’s intent is to intervene in the target state’s internal affairs, which would normally taint the economic measures taken, it must be acknowledged that the decision to maintain, enhance, or rupture economic relations with another state is a matter that, according to the ICJ, every state, the intervenor included, must be free to decide independently.²³⁹ In fact, as the intervening state is acting within its rights, it could be argued that it is truthfully informing the target state’s electorate of the consequences of a specific election result.

In Helal’s view, withdrawing or granting benefits in order to achieve a specific election result –though generally lawful– becomes unlawful, if such actions are combined with other unlawful means. He views such a strategy as a composite breach of the non-intervention rule. Less convincingly, he argues that such economic measures merely amount to “persuasion” if not combined with unlawful means. Helal, supra note 10, at 81. For example, Helal views the hacking of the emails circulating among the leadership of Democratic Party and their subsequent publication in order to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election as unlawful. Had Russia at the same time threatened to impose sanctions on the United States, these sanctions would have therefore been rendered unlawful. Had Russia, on the other hand, only threatened the United States with the imposition of sanctions in the case of a Clinton victory, that, in his view, would have been lawful. A potentially extremely coercive measure’s legality (imposition of sanctions) would thus depend on whether the intervenor resorted to other, potentially minor, but unlawful means of intervention, which is not convincing.

Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion.\n\nOnce a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.\n\n## A brief legal analysis of the interventions in 1948 and 2016\n\nApplied to the 1948 election in Italy and the 2016 election in the United States, the foregoing analysis leads to the following assessment: official statements on the part of US officials in the run-up to the Italian election in 1948, which statements advised against voting for the Communist Party, were lawful, as their aim was to persuade rather than coerce. Similarly, the broadcasts, such as those by the Voice of America, described above (which broadcasts were accessible in Italy) or through Russian-origin television programs on RT or Sputnik, even though biased and perhaps influential, were not unlawful either. Similarly, the intent of the massive letter-writing campaign organized in the United States among Italian Americans was persuasive rather than coercive.\n\nThe forging of documents, the bribing of Italian journalists, and the massive funding of center-right parties in Italy were unlawful, as were",
    "INDIANA JOURNAL OF GLOBAL LEGAL STUDIES 29:2\n\nthe efforts by the Russian government to initiate and maintain a social media campaign in favor of Trump utilizing fake American identities. The hacking of e-mails originating from leaders within Clinton's Democratic Party, and the subsequent disclosure of the information, were unlawful because they were gained by unlawful espionage in order to achieve an unlawful aim—namely, having a say in another state's election outcome. Without more details, it is difficult to judge whether the US disclosures as far as Italian politicians' personal lives are concerned were lawful or unlawful—that depends on how the information was obtained and whether the stories disseminated were true or false. Lastly, possibly the most coercive instruments used by the United States, the threat to stop economic aid to Italy and the promise of further economic support dependent on the Italian election results, were lawful, as was the threat to bar Communist-supporting Italians from entering the United States, because these measures were within the United States' rights as an independent state conducting its external affairs.\n\n## THE VIOLATION OF SOVEREIGNTY\n\nIntervening in another state's election can also imply a violation of that state's sovereignty. Although it is difficult to provide an exact definition of \"sovereignty\" as understood in public international law,²⁴⁰ there is general agreement that sovereignty includes a state's right to demand respect for its territorial integrity and political independence.²⁴¹ As early as 1949, the ICJ stressed the importance of the concept of sovereignty: \"Between independent states, respect for territorial sovereignty is an essential foundation of international relations.\"²⁴² Territorial sovereignty includes a state's right to govern effectively to the exclusion of other states on its territory.²⁴³ Consequently, no state has the right to exercise governmental functions on another state's territory without that state's permission.²⁴⁴ In the Las Palmas case,²⁴⁵ a\n\n240.

Most scholars responding to Ohlin's arguments have pointed out that the right of self-determination has so far not been viewed as applicable to already existent states.²⁶⁴ Rather, the counterargument goes, the right of self-determination has traditionally only been granted to peoples in the process of decolonization.²⁶⁵ More recently, in light of the Canadian Supreme Court's groundbreaking judgment on a possible secession by Québec,²⁶⁶ some have argued that a right of external self-determination could apply to a people suffering internal discrimination within an existent state.²⁶⁷ Sovereign states though, the argument concludes, cannot lay claim to a right of self-determination.²⁶⁸\n\nAlthough the arguments just set out do have some merit, I agree with Ohlin that a people living within an already existent state does have a right of self-determination that can be violated.²⁶⁹ There is no reason to believe that the right of self-determination automatically ceases to exist once a people has managed to organize itself in an\n\n262.

However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it does not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory.

Although any “Western” (or allied) system of government would be protected by Ohlin’s understanding of the right of self-determination, it potentially may seem acceptable to intervene in Russian, or perhaps even Hungarian, elections due to the fact that they do not follow a democratic model closely aligned to the US example.²⁸⁵\n\nand bishops of the Church of England).

See Damrosch, supra note 11, at 37–45. However, Damrosch argues that interfering in other states’ political processes may be justified if the target state does not allow for meaningful participation on the part of its citizens. She only wants to exclude target states from the prohibition of interventions that evidence a “serious pattern of violation of political human rights,” while emphasizing that “[w]estern-style pluralist democracy is only one of a variety of models that states may employ to give their citizens a voice in government . . .” Limiting international law’s protection to “democratic” states, on the other hand, may well lead to a “disagreement . . . over the specific modalities of political participation. Such disagreements could concern many issues of philosophy and practice – for example, single member districts versus at-large election, runoffs, proportional representation of minority parties . . .” possibly offering an intervenor many arguments in order to justify excluding a specific (target) state from its own understanding of democracy.\n\n284.

Furthermore, the way Ohlin seems to want to apply such a right—namely, by offering protection only to democratic systems as understood mainly in the United States—has no chance of being accepted as a rule of customary international law, as non-Western states are bound to reject the creation of a rule that gives the impression of being self-serving.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThis article set out to examine the lawfulness of foreign election meddling in public international law. I began by describing two such events in the past in more detail—the US interference in the Italian election of 1948 and the Russian activities in relation to the US election in 2016. I then briefly addressed a few other instances of US or Russian election interference. These examples served to illustrate that it has always been possible to become heavily involved in other states' elections and that states have done so in different ways. Past US interference in other states' elections may help explain US President Obama's ambiguous statement regarding Russian election meddling in 2016, when he declared such actions as Russian \"efforts to undermine international norms of behavior.\"²⁸⁷ Subsequently, I analyzed whether such election meddling is compatible with public international law and argued that the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs is the decisive rule of international law when trying to establish whether a specific action amounts to a violation of international law. There is widespread agreement that elections are among the matters protected by the prohibition on interventions.²⁸⁸ The subsequent analysis therefore centered on the question of whether specific actions\n\n286.

    "MEDDLING IN FOREIGN ELECTIONS AND PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW115\n\ncan be classified as “methods of coercion.” The term “coercion” obviously excludes from the prohibition means of persuasion.²⁸⁹ Therefore, it is, for example, not unlawful for a state to publicly state its preferences as to the outcome of an election in another state.²⁹⁰ The interfering state is thereby simply advocating an outcome that it believes to be in its national interest. The target state and its people remain free to decide whether and how to respond.\n\nSuch persuasion, however, morphs into coercion if the intervenor employs deception or manipulation in order to promote its self-interest during another state’s election campaign.²⁹¹ Although messages posted on social media may be persuasive rather than coercive in content, the fact that the intervenor disguises these posts’ origin by implying that they reflect views held by target-state citizens makes them coercive, as the target state cannot respond to, much less terminate, such interference at its pleasure. It is the target state’s helplessness in the face of such interference that is the driving force behind the intervenor’s deception. The intervening state actively participates in another state’s election campaign in a way that the target cannot respond to, much less prevent or terminate. This therefore amounts to coercive interference. It follows that more intrusive election meddling, such as spreading fake news, (cyber) espionage, and funding political parties and individual politicians, as well as disrupting the target state’s electoral process, certainly meet the threshold of a prohibited intervention.²⁹² This threshold is even more clearly met if the intervenor’s goal is to undermine the public’s trust in the target state’s electoral process.²⁹³\n\nHowever, the analysis also revealed that one of the most coercive interventions in another state’s election is lawful. The threat to sever economic ties or, conversely, the promise of economic benefits dependent on the election result is potentially extremely coercive as far as voters\n\n289.

Given that maintaining, enhancing, or discontinuing economic ties with another state is widely seen as an issue at every state's sovereign discretion, it follows that such economic coercion, nevertheless, remains lawful.²⁹⁴ In such instances, it could even plausibly be argued that the intervenor is providing target-state citizens with information they may wish to consider when deciding who to vote for. Lastly, the application of these rules to the instances of election meddling in Italy in 1948 and the United States in 2016 confirms that the prohibition on interventions enables a comprehensive legal analysis of foreign interference in elections.\n\nAfter explaining the central role of the prohibition on interventions when judging the lawfulness of election meddling, I briefly set out why I believe the two other rules of international law that are invoked in this context are less satisfactory. While many of the activities associated with election meddling potentially violate the target state's sovereignty, I also explained that many other such undertakings do not. Funding political parties, and many forms of cyber intervention, often do not undermine the target state's exclusive authority within its territory.²⁹⁵ Lastly, I discussed the right of self-determination as another potential rule of public international law implicated by election meddling, as is argued by Jens Ohlin.²⁹⁶ I argued that, in my view, there is no room for the separate application of the right of self-determination as far as already existent states are concerned, as their peoples' rights are sufficiently protected by the prohibition of outside interventions in their internal matters.²⁹⁷ Furthermore, Jens Ohlin, at least by implication,\n\n²⁹⁴.

Res. 2734 (XXV) ¶ 4, Declaration on International Security (Dec. 16, 1970). But see Ohlen, supra note 10, at 67–89 (viewing the prohibition on interventions as protecting only a state's sovereignty). However, Ohlen's proposition is not convincing. A state's sovereignty is not necessarily completely identical to the right to be free from outside interventions as Ohlen claims. Rather, sovereignty and the prohibition on interventions certainly overlap insofar as the intervenor is interfering with the target state's right to govern within its territory. However, a prohibited intervention can take place that, for example, aims to severely disrupt the target state's foreign or trade policy. Such an intervention would not necessarily violate the target state's sovereignty, as it",

It follows that there is no chance of such a rule being accepted as customary international law by a majority of states.\n\nMany forms of election meddling are unlawful and violate the prohibition on interventions in other states' internal affairs. The fact that economic coercion remains lawful, however, renders the prohibition much less effective. Of course, it would be beneficial if clear international rules could be developed that outline which conduct is permissible in respect of other states' elections. Now that powerful states such as the United States are themselves vulnerable to potentially decisive foreign election meddling, there may even be a unique opportunity to develop such legal guidelines. That kind of discussion is urgently needed, as the danger of massive interventions in foreign elections is growing rapidly due to the vast possibilities the internet offers. As Dov Levin has pointed out, the greatest dangers to the integrity of future elections are massive campaign funding utilizing cryptocurrencies²⁹⁸ and tampering with election results.²⁹⁹ Negotiations should therefore be initiated but conducted on a level playing field.³⁰⁰ An approach based on Western or \"democratic\" exceptionalism will undoubtedly fail.\n\ndoes not need to take place on its territory and does not have to amount to a usurpation of the target state's governmental functions within that territory.

Issuing statements in support of one of the competing parties, instigating editorials in domestic newspapers, or broadcasting reports supportive of a candidate are lawful. The target state can respond, and the electorate can evaluate such information correctly. It is also lawful to disseminate true information in a timely manner so long as the intervenor obtained it in a lawful fashion. Once a state resorts to deceit and manipulation in order to disguise its intentions, the intervention becomes unlawful, as the target state cannot terminate the interference. The intervening state is thereby actively, but often covertly, participating in the target state's election campaign in such a way that the intervenor hopes the target state cannot prevent or terminate. Funding foreign political parties or intervening in the electoral process itself is similarly coercive in nature and violates the prohibition on interventions. Nevertheless, any prospective intervenor has a powerful tool at its disposal—although also clearly coercive, the threat to sever, or the promise to enhance, economic relations is lawful, as such decisions are at every state's, the intervenor's included, discretion.",
