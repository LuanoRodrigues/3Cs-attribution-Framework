This article introduces a conceptual framework to discuss trust within cyberspace as an information system, and its impact on coercive power in state-state and state-private relations. Contrasting Chinese and Western cyber ecosystems reveals that leveraging domestic political economy is key in projecting national cyber power, but cyberspace itself may suffer adverse structural outcomes of increased information asymmetries, lower trust, and potential fragmentation.\n# 1. Introduction\nThere is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation¹, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal².\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n¹ Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\".

Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations³⁴, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence⁵, and theories of economic sanctions⁶ provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy⁷ economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence⁸⁹ upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime¹⁰.\n³ Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’¹¹¹² has been applied to domains of surveillance¹³, governance of Internet platforms¹⁴, telecommunications rivalries¹⁵, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models¹⁶. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies¹⁷.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition¹⁸, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'¹⁹. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance²⁰²¹. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive²².\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n¹⁸ Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation²⁴. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n²⁴ David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n## 2. On trust\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus²⁵, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’²⁶.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n²⁵ Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n²⁶ Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n27 Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n28 Korczynski, M. (2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds²⁹.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened³⁰³¹. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu\n²⁹ Kydd, A. H. (2018).

(2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'³².\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence\n³² Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system\nCyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyber-\nspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions³³ ³⁴³⁵. Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation³⁶; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'³⁷. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n³³ Kuehl, D. T. (2011). From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem. Cyberpower and National Security. F. D. Kramer, S. H. Starr and L. K. Wentz, University of Nebraska Press.\n³⁴ .Definition and Implications :Cyberspace .(2010) Lorents .and P .R ,Ottis\n³⁵ Clark, D. D. (2010). Characterizing cyberspace: Past, present and future.

(2013). \"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\" Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems³⁸ as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n³⁸ Adner, R. (2017). \"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.\nStructurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents³⁹. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n³⁹ Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000). \"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\" Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection\nStrategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance⁴⁰ (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n⁴⁰ Cadell, C. \"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\" Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction⁴¹.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'⁴². As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n⁴¹ Thompson, A.

Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'⁴³.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains ⁴⁴ in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox⁴⁵ where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the\n⁴³ Lonergan, E.

Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats⁴⁶.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n⁴⁶ Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs⁴⁷⁴⁸. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'⁴⁹. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n⁴⁷ Damm, J.

(2020). \"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\" Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence,\n50 Cunningham, F. S.

Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative⁵³⁵⁴. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance⁵⁵, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.\n## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft\nHow states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical⁵⁷, fated to self-regulation⁵⁸, or destined for international order⁵⁹; as a social, networked space⁶⁰, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic\n⁵⁶ Holland, J. and E.

Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\n61 Deibert, R. and R.

Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain⁶⁶, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability⁶⁷ incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools⁶⁸. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the\n⁶⁶ Kello, L.

As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior\n⁶⁹ Jensen, B.

Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nagreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global\nsupply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its\n72 Norris, W.

Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations\nMany analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations⁷⁴. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors\n⁷³ .'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo .(2023) .B .G ,Mueller\n⁷⁴ Carr, M. (2016). \"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\" International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software\nsupply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009⁷⁶.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations⁷⁷. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance\n⁷⁶ Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n⁷⁷ Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling⁷⁸⁷⁹⁸⁰⁸¹.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer⁸². In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub-\n⁷⁸ Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively⁸³. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence⁸⁴.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities\nPrivate actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets.

Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as\nWhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa\ntion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector⁸⁵.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible⁸⁶. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities\n⁸⁵ Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n⁸⁶ Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n# 5. Conclusion\n[87] Huang, Y. (2023).

An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles $^{8990}$ . Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies $^{91}$ . Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds.

Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting $^{93}$  in what has been characterized as an anarchical space $^{94}$ , may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives $^{95}$ .\n92 Mueller, M.

(2022). \"Fighting Alone is called Losing: The Unlearned Lessons of Fragmented Systems\".\" The Cyber Defense Review 7(1): 75-82.\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity⁹⁶.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building⁹⁷, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin-\n⁹⁶ .'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China .(2023) .I ,Group\n⁹⁷ Fick, N.

Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility¹⁰⁰.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the\n⁹⁸ Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance.

This article introduces a conceptual framework to discuss trust within cyberspace as an information system, and its impact on coercive power in state-state and state-private relations. Contrasting Chinese and Western cyber ecosystems reveals that leveraging domestic political economy is key in projecting national cyber power, but cyberspace itself may suffer adverse structural outcomes of increased information asymmetries, lower trust, and potential fragmentation.\n# 1. Introduction\nThere is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal.\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\". Security Studies 26(3): 452-481.\n Economic, political or technological conflict is mediated through interdependence in cyberspace: in strategic competition over control of semiconductor supply chains for greater compute, market domination over electric vehicle and associated consumer data, subsidies in tech sector investments, and trade reciprocity in the use of consumer tech apps such as TikTok or WhatsApp in US and Chinese digital marketplaces respectively are not explicit cyber capabilities, but can all indirectly impact and influence strategic success. Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence, and theories of economic sanctions provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime.\n Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’ has been applied to domains of surveillance, governance of Internet platforms, telecommunications rivalries, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses. Software businesses such as Apple and Microsoft diversified into tech ecosystems, offering a series of interconnected products despite anti-trust concerns.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive.\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n## 2. On trust\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu\n Kydd, A. H. (2018). Trust and Mistrust in International Relations, Princeton University Press.\n Gambetta, Diego (ed.) (1988). Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations. Blackwell.\n Korczynski, M. (2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'.\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence\n Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system\nCyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyber-\nspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions . Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n Kuehl, D.

(2013). \"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\" Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n Adner, R. (2017). \"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.\nStructurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000). \"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\" Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection\nStrategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n Cadell, C. \"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\" Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'. As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n Thompson, A. (2021). Buying Silence: The Price of Internet Censorship in China’, Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n Blagden, D. (2020). \"Deterring Cyber Coercion: The Exaggerated Problem of Attribution'.\" Survival 62(1): 131-148.\nThe coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains  in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the\n Lonergan, E.

Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n Damm, J. (2007). \"The Internet and the Fragmentation of Chinese Society'.\" Critical Asian Studies 39(2): 273-294.\n Jiang, Y. (2012). Cyber-Nationalism in China.

(2020). \"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\" Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence,\n\nChina’s 'wangluo quangguo' strategy of a competitive tech industry is incentivized to invest in long-term cyberspace stability.\nChina’s cooperative strategies in cyberspace are an extension of its foreign policy objectives. Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances. The exclusion of France from the 2021 AUKUS alliance for nuclear powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific created diplomatic tensions ultimately resolved in December 2023 through a bilateral security\n Chinese and ?Coalition of the Unwilling .(2019) Creemers .Adamson and R .L ,.D ,Broeders .’Russian Perspectives on Cyberspace\n Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, 2023\n Curtis, S. and I.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.\n## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft\nHow states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical, fated to self-regulation, or destined for international order; as a social, networked space, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic\n Holland, J. and E. Staunton (2024). \"'BrOthers in Arms': France, the Anglosphere and AUKUS'.\" International Affairs 100(2): 712-729.\n Post, D. G.

Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\n\nAs discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the\n Kello, L.

Computers &amp; Security 72: 26-59.\ncost of Stuxnet... could have launched three cruise missile offensive strikes’ and the supposed 'ease of attack' may not lead to deterrence through ease in deception.\nDespite mixed success in signaling intentions due to a high risk of misinterpretation, scope creep by affecting unintended targets through interdependence, or miscalculation in imposed costs on both sides, overtly coercive strategies do not always produce concessions — possibly because the target’s structural position renders concessions more expensive than imposed by coercion, or the object of concession has been misunderstood between coercer and target. As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior\n Jensen, B. (2017). \"The Cyber Character of Political Warfare'.\" The Brown Journal of World Affairs 24(1): 159-172.\n Gartzke, E. and J. R.

Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nagreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global\nsupply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its\n\nprivate partnerships, despite Western intelligence agencies' high estimation of Russia's cyber capabilities. Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations\nMany analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors\n .'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo .(2023) .B .G ,Mueller\n Carr, M. (2016). \"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\" International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software\nsupply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance\n Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer. In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub-\n Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities\nPrivate actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets.

Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as\nWhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa\ntion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities\n Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n# 5. Conclusion\n[87] Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.\nA political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles $^{8990}$ . Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies $^{91}$ . Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role\n\ncontexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting $^{93}$  in what has been characterized as an anarchical space $^{94}$ , may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives $^{95}$ .\n\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin-\n .'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China .(2023) .I ,Group\n Fick, N.

Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the\n Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance.

Public-private actor structural relations Many analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations⁷⁴. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace."

    "# 1. Introduction": "There is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation¹, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal².\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n¹ Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\".

Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations³⁴, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence⁵, and theories of economic sanctions⁶ provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy⁷ economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence⁸⁹ upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime¹⁰.\n³ Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’¹¹¹² has been applied to domains of surveillance¹³, governance of Internet platforms¹⁴, telecommunications rivalries¹⁵, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models¹⁶. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies¹⁷.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition¹⁸, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'¹⁹. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance²⁰²¹. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive²².\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n¹⁸ Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation²⁴. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n²⁴ David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.",
    "## 2. On trust": "### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus²⁵, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’²⁶.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n²⁵ Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n²⁶ Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds²⁹.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened³⁰³¹. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu ²⁹ Kydd, A. H. (2018). Trust and Mistrust in International Relations, Princeton University Press.\n³⁰ Gambetta, Diego (ed.) (1988). Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations. Blackwell.\n³¹ Korczynski, M. (2000).\"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'³².\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence ³² Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system Cyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyberspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions³³ ³⁴³⁵. Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation³⁶; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'³⁷. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n³³ Kuehl, D. T. (2011). From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem. Cyberpower and National Security. F. D. Kramer, S. H. Starr and L. K. Wentz, University of Nebraska Press.\n³⁴.Definition and Implications:Cyberspace.(2010) Lorents.and P.R,Ottis ³⁵ Clark, D. D. (2010). Characterizing cyberspace: Past, present and future.

(2013).\"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\"Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems³⁸ as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n³⁸ Adner, R. (2017).\"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.\nStructurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents³⁹. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n³⁹ Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000).\"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\"Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection Strategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance⁴⁰ (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n⁴⁰ Cadell, C.\"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\"Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction⁴¹.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'⁴². As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n⁴¹ Thompson, A. (2021). Buying Silence: The Price of Internet Censorship in China’, Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n⁴² Blagden, D. (2020).\"Deterring Cyber Coercion: The Exaggerated Problem of Attribution'.\"Survival 62(1): 131-148.\nThe coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'⁴³.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains ⁴⁴ in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox⁴⁵ where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the ⁴³ Lonergan, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2022).\"Cyber Operations, Accommodative Signaling, and the De-Escalation of International Crises.\"Security Studies 31(1): 32-64.\n⁴⁴ Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017).\"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\". Ibid. 26(3): 452-481.\n⁴⁵ Lindsay, J. and E. Gartzke (2016). Coercion through Cyberspace: The Stability-Instability Paradox Revisited'.

Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats⁴⁶.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n⁴⁶ Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs⁴⁷⁴⁸. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'⁴⁹. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n⁴⁷ Damm, J. (2007).\"The Internet and the Fragmentation of Chinese Society'.\"Critical Asian Studies 39(2): 273-294.\n⁴⁸ Jiang, Y. (2012). Cyber-Nationalism in China.

(2020).\"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\"Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence, China’s 'wangluo quangguo' strategy of a competitive tech industry is incentivized to invest in long-term cyberspace stability⁵².\nChina’s cooperative strategies in cyberspace are an extension of its foreign policy objectives. Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative⁵³⁵⁴. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance⁵⁵, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances. The exclusion of France from the 2021 AUKUS alliance for nuclear powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific created diplomatic tensions ultimately resolved in December 2023 through a bilateral security ⁵² Chinese and?Coalition of the Unwilling.(2019) Creemers.Adamson and R.L,.D,Broeders.’Russian Perspectives on Cyberspace ⁵³ Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, 2023 ⁵⁴ Curtis, S. and I.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.",
    "## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft How states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical⁵⁷, fated to self-regulation⁵⁸, or destined for international order⁵⁹; as a social, networked space⁶⁰, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic ⁵⁶ Holland, J. and E. Staunton (2024).\"'BrOthers in Arms': France, the Anglosphere and AUKUS'.\"International Affairs 100(2): 712-729.": "⁵⁷ Post, D. G.

Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\nAs discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain⁶⁶, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability⁶⁷ incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools⁶⁸. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the ⁶⁶ Kello, L.

As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior ⁶⁹ Jensen, B.

Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global supply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its private partnerships, despite Western intelligence agencies' high estimation of Russia's cyber capabilities⁷³. Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.",
    "## 4. Public-private actor structural relations Many analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations⁷⁴. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.": "## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors ⁷³.'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo.(2023).B.G,Mueller ⁷⁴ Carr, M. (2016).\"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\"International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software supply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009⁷⁶.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations⁷⁷. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance ⁷⁶ Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n⁷⁷ Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling⁷⁸⁷⁹⁸⁰⁸¹.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer⁸². In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub- ⁷⁸ Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively⁸³. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence⁸⁴.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities Private actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets. The ⁸³ Zúñiga, N. (2024).\"The geopolitics of technology standards: historical context for US, EU and Chinese approaches\". International Affairs 100(4): 1635-1652.\n⁸⁴ Zhang, A. H. (2021). Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as WhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa tion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector⁸⁵.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible⁸⁶. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities ⁸⁵ Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n⁸⁶ Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.",
    "# 5. Conclusion [87] Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.": "A political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles. Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies. Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role contexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting in what has been characterized as an anarchical space, may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives.\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity⁹⁶.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building⁹⁷, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin- ⁹⁶.'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China.(2023).I,Group ⁹⁷ Fick, N. (2022).\"Confronting Reality in Cyberspace: Foreign Policy for a Fragmented Internet.\"Council on Foreign Relations.\nancial crisis⁹⁸, and abandoned a liberal economic approach⁹⁹. Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility¹⁰⁰.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the ⁹⁸ Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance. The future of China's domestic political economy may well indicate its ¹⁰¹ Blagden, D.

This article introduces a conceptual framework to discuss trust within cyberspace as an information system, and its impact on coercive power in state-state and state-private relations. Contrasting Chinese and Western cyber ecosystems reveals that leveraging domestic political economy is key in projecting national cyber power, but cyberspace itself may suffer adverse structural outcomes of increased information asymmetries, lower trust, and potential fragmentation.\n# 1. Introduction\nThere is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal.\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\".

Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence, and theories of economic sanctions provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime.\n Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’ has been applied to domains of surveillance, governance of Internet platforms, telecommunications rivalries, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses. Software businesses such as Apple and Microsoft diversified into tech ecosystems, offering a series of interconnected products despite anti-trust concerns.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive.\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n## 2. On trust\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu\n Kydd, A. H. (2018). Trust and Mistrust in International Relations, Princeton University Press.\n Gambetta, Diego (ed.) (1988). Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations. Blackwell.\n Korczynski, M. (2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'.\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence\n Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system\nCyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyber-\nspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions . Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n Kuehl, D. T. (2011). From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem. Cyberpower and National Security. F. D. Kramer, S. H. Starr and L. K. Wentz, University of Nebraska Press.\n .Definition and Implications :Cyberspace .(2010) Lorents .and P .R ,Ottis\n Clark, D. D. (2010). Characterizing cyberspace: Past, present and future.

(2013). \"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\" Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n Adner, R. (2017). \"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.\nStructurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000). \"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\" Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection\nStrategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n Cadell, C. \"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\" Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'. As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n Thompson, A. (2021). Buying Silence: The Price of Internet Censorship in China’, Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n Blagden, D. (2020). \"Deterring Cyber Coercion: The Exaggerated Problem of Attribution'.\" Survival 62(1): 131-148.\nThe coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains  in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the\n Lonergan, E.

Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\". Ibid. 26(3): 452-481.\n Lindsay, J. and E. Gartzke (2016). Coercion through Cyberspace: The Stability-Instability Paradox Revisited'.

Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n Damm, J. (2007). \"The Internet and the Fragmentation of Chinese Society'.\" Critical Asian Studies 39(2): 273-294.\n Jiang, Y. (2012). Cyber-Nationalism in China.

(2020). \"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\" Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence,\n\nChina’s 'wangluo quangguo' strategy of a competitive tech industry is incentivized to invest in long-term cyberspace stability.\nChina’s cooperative strategies in cyberspace are an extension of its foreign policy objectives. Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances. The exclusion of France from the 2021 AUKUS alliance for nuclear powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific created diplomatic tensions ultimately resolved in December 2023 through a bilateral security\n Chinese and ?Coalition of the Unwilling .(2019) Creemers .Adamson and R .L ,.D ,Broeders .’Russian Perspectives on Cyberspace\n Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, 2023\n Curtis, S. and I.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.\n## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft\nHow states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical, fated to self-regulation, or destined for international order; as a social, networked space, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic\n Holland, J. and E. Staunton (2024). \"'BrOthers in Arms': France, the Anglosphere and AUKUS'.\" International Affairs 100(2): 712-729.\n Post, D. G.

Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\n\nAs discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the\n Kello, L.

Computers &amp; Security 72: 26-59.\ncost of Stuxnet... could have launched three cruise missile offensive strikes’ and the supposed 'ease of attack' may not lead to deterrence through ease in deception.\nDespite mixed success in signaling intentions due to a high risk of misinterpretation, scope creep by affecting unintended targets through interdependence, or miscalculation in imposed costs on both sides, overtly coercive strategies do not always produce concessions — possibly because the target’s structural position renders concessions more expensive than imposed by coercion, or the object of concession has been misunderstood between coercer and target. As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior\n Jensen, B. (2017). \"The Cyber Character of Political Warfare'.\" The Brown Journal of World Affairs 24(1): 159-172.\n Gartzke, E. and J. R.

Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nagreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global\nsupply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its\n\nprivate partnerships, despite Western intelligence agencies' high estimation of Russia's cyber capabilities. Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations\nMany analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors\n .'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo .(2023) .B .G ,Mueller\n Carr, M. (2016). \"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\" International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software\nsupply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance\n Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer. In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub-\n Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities\nPrivate actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets.

Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as\nWhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa\ntion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities\n Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n# 5. Conclusion\n[87] Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.\nA political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles $^{8990}$ . Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies $^{91}$ . Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role\n\ncontexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting $^{93}$  in what has been characterized as an anarchical space $^{94}$ , may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives $^{95}$ .\n\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin-\n .'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China .(2023) .I ,Group\n Fick, N.

Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the\n Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance.

This article introduces a conceptual framework to discuss trust within cyberspace as an information system, and its impact on coercive power in state-state and state-private relations. Contrasting Chinese and Western cyber ecosystems reveals that leveraging domestic political economy is key in projecting national cyber power, but cyberspace itself may suffer adverse structural outcomes of increased information asymmetries, lower trust, and potential fragmentation.\n# 1. Introduction\nThere is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal.\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\".

Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence, and theories of economic sanctions provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime.\n Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’ has been applied to domains of surveillance, governance of Internet platforms, telecommunications rivalries, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses. Software businesses such as Apple and Microsoft diversified into tech ecosystems, offering a series of interconnected products despite anti-trust concerns.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive.\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n## 2. On trust\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu\n Kydd, A. H. (2018). Trust and Mistrust in International Relations, Princeton University Press.\n Gambetta, Diego (ed.) (1988). Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations. Blackwell.\n Korczynski, M. (2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'.\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence\n Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system\nCyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyber-\nspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions . Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n Kuehl, D. T. (2011). From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem. Cyberpower and National Security. F. D. Kramer, S. H. Starr and L. K. Wentz, University of Nebraska Press.\n .Definition and Implications :Cyberspace .(2010) Lorents .and P .R ,Ottis\n Clark, D. D. (2010). Characterizing cyberspace: Past, present and future.

(2013). \"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\" Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n Adner, R. (2017). \"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\".

Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000). \"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\" Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection\nStrategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n Cadell, C. \"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\" Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'. As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n Thompson, A. (2021). Buying Silence: The Price of Internet Censorship in China’, Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n Blagden, D. (2020). \"Deterring Cyber Coercion: The Exaggerated Problem of Attribution'.\" Survival 62(1): 131-148.\nThe coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains  in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the\n Lonergan, E.

Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n Damm, J. (2007). \"The Internet and the Fragmentation of Chinese Society'.\" Critical Asian Studies 39(2): 273-294.\n Jiang, Y. (2012). Cyber-Nationalism in China.

(2020). \"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\" Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence,\n\nChina’s 'wangluo quangguo' strategy of a competitive tech industry is incentivized to invest in long-term cyberspace stability.\nChina’s cooperative strategies in cyberspace are an extension of its foreign policy objectives. Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances. The exclusion of France from the 2021 AUKUS alliance for nuclear powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific created diplomatic tensions ultimately resolved in December 2023 through a bilateral security\n Chinese and ?Coalition of the Unwilling .(2019) Creemers .Adamson and R .L ,.D ,Broeders .’Russian Perspectives on Cyberspace\n Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, 2023\n Curtis, S. and I.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.\n## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft\nHow states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical, fated to self-regulation, or destined for international order; as a social, networked space, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic\n Holland, J. and E. Staunton (2024). \"'BrOthers in Arms': France, the Anglosphere and AUKUS'.\" International Affairs 100(2): 712-729.\n Post, D. G.

(2007). \"Cyberspace as/and Space'.\" Columbia Law Review 107: 210.\nrestraints'61; as an ‘equalizer’ affording all actors the power of scale, markets and anonymity62; as a 'control space' consisting of socio-technical regulatory and contract mechanisms that operates as 'an institution' instead of anarchy63; as a previously anarchical space that may be governed through evolving norms and standards up to which liberal democracies can hold themselves64.\nWhile these varying viewpoints are contemporaneous interpretations, we observe through our framework that cyberspace is neither uniformly anarchical, nor fully institutional. Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\n\nAs discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the\n Kello, L.

Computers &amp; Security 72: 26-59.\ncost of Stuxnet... could have launched three cruise missile offensive strikes’ and the supposed 'ease of attack' may not lead to deterrence through ease in deception.\nDespite mixed success in signaling intentions due to a high risk of misinterpretation, scope creep by affecting unintended targets through interdependence, or miscalculation in imposed costs on both sides, overtly coercive strategies do not always produce concessions — possibly because the target’s structural position renders concessions more expensive than imposed by coercion, or the object of concession has been misunderstood between coercer and target. As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior\n Jensen, B. (2017). \"The Cyber Character of Political Warfare'.\" The Brown Journal of World Affairs 24(1): 159-172.\n Gartzke, E. and J. R. Lindsay (2015). \"Weaving Tangled Webs: Offense, Defense, and Deception in Cyberspace'.\" Security Studies 24(2): 316-348.\n Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy.

Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nagreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global\nsupply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its\n\nprivate partnerships, despite Western intelligence agencies' high estimation of Russia's cyber capabilities. Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations\nMany analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors\n .'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo .(2023) .B .G ,Mueller\n Carr, M. (2016). \"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\" International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software\nsupply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance\n Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer. In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub-\n Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities\nPrivate actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets.

Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as\nWhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa\ntion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities\n Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n# 5. Conclusion\n[87] Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.\nA political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles $^{8990}$ . Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies $^{91}$ . Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role\n\ncontexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting $^{93}$  in what has been characterized as an anarchical space $^{94}$ , may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives $^{95}$ .\n\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin-\n .'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China .(2023) .I ,Group\n Fick, N.

Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the\n Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance.

This article introduces a conceptual framework to discuss trust within cyberspace as an information system, and its impact on coercive power in state-state and state-private relations. Contrasting Chinese and Western cyber ecosystems reveals that leveraging domestic political economy is key in projecting national cyber power, but cyberspace itself may suffer adverse structural outcomes of increased information asymmetries, lower trust, and potential fragmentation.\n# 1. Introduction\nThere is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation¹, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal².\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n¹ Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\". Security Studies 26(3): 452-481.\n² Economic, political or technological conflict is mediated through interdependence in cyberspace: in strategic competition over control of semiconductor supply chains for greater compute, market domination over electric vehicle and associated consumer data, subsidies in tech sector investments, and trade reciprocity in the use of consumer tech apps such as TikTok or WhatsApp in US and Chinese digital marketplaces respectively are not explicit cyber capabilities, but can all indirectly impact and influence strategic success. Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations³⁴, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence⁵, and theories of economic sanctions⁶ provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy⁷ economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence⁸⁹ upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime¹⁰.\n³ Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’¹¹¹² has been applied to domains of surveillance¹³, governance of Internet platforms¹⁴, telecommunications rivalries¹⁵, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models¹⁶. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies¹⁷.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition¹⁸, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'¹⁹. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance²⁰²¹. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive²².\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n¹⁸ Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation²⁴. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n²⁴ David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n## 2. On trust\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus²⁵, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’²⁶.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n²⁵ Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n²⁶ Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n27 Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n28 Korczynski, M. (2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds²⁹.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened³⁰³¹. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu\n²⁹ Kydd, A. H. (2018).

(2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'³².\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence\n³² Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system\nCyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyber-\nspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions³³ ³⁴³⁵. Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation³⁶; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'³⁷. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n³³ Kuehl, D. T. (2011). From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem. Cyberpower and National Security. F. D. Kramer, S. H. Starr and L. K. Wentz, University of Nebraska Press.\n³⁴ .Definition and Implications :Cyberspace .(2010) Lorents .and P .R ,Ottis\n³⁵ Clark, D. D. (2010). Characterizing cyberspace: Past, present and future.

(2013). \"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\" Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems³⁸ as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n³⁸ Adner, R. (2017). \"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.\nStructurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents³⁹. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n³⁹ Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000). \"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\" Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection\nStrategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance⁴⁰ (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n⁴⁰ Cadell, C. \"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\" Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction⁴¹.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'⁴². As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n⁴¹ Thompson, A. (2021). Buying Silence: The Price of Internet Censorship in China’, Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n⁴² Blagden, D. (2020). \"Deterring Cyber Coercion: The Exaggerated Problem of Attribution'.\" Survival 62(1): 131-148.\nThe coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'⁴³.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains ⁴⁴ in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox⁴⁵ where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the\n⁴³ Lonergan, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2022). \"Cyber Operations, Accommodative Signaling, and the De-Escalation of International Crises.\" Security Studies 31(1): 32-64.\n⁴⁴ Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\". Ibid. 26(3): 452-481.\n⁴⁵ Lindsay, J. and E. Gartzke (2016). Coercion through Cyberspace: The Stability-Instability Paradox Revisited'. The Power to Hurt: Coercion in Theory and in Practice. Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats⁴⁶.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n⁴⁶ Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs⁴⁷⁴⁸. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'⁴⁹. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n⁴⁷ Damm, J. (2007). \"The Internet and the Fragmentation of Chinese Society'.\" Critical Asian Studies 39(2): 273-294.\n⁴⁸ Jiang, Y. (2012). Cyber-Nationalism in China.

(2020). \"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\" Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence,\n50 Cunningham, F. S. (2022). \"Strategic Substitution: China’s Search for Coercive Leverage in the Information Age\". International Security 47(1): 46-92.\n51 Adamsky, D. (2023).

The Russian Way of Deterrence, Stanford University Press.\nChina’s 'wangluo quangguo' strategy of a competitive tech industry is incentivized to invest in long-term cyberspace stability⁵².\nChina’s cooperative strategies in cyberspace are an extension of its foreign policy objectives. Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative⁵³⁵⁴. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance⁵⁵, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.\n## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft\nHow states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical⁵⁷, fated to self-regulation⁵⁸, or destined for international order⁵⁹; as a social, networked space⁶⁰, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic\n⁵⁶ Holland, J. and E. Staunton (2024). \"'BrOthers in Arms': France, the Anglosphere and AUKUS'.\" International Affairs 100(2): 712-729.\n⁵⁷ Post, D. G.

Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\n61 Deibert, R. and R. Rohozinski (2010). \"Liberation vs. Control: The Future of Cyberspace\". Journal of Democracy 21(4): 43-57.\n62 Rowland, J., M. Rice and S.

(2020). \"The Territorialization of Cyberspace*.\" International Studies Review 22(3): 482-506.\nAs discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain⁶⁶, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability⁶⁷ incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools⁶⁸. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the\n⁶⁶ Kello, L.

As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior\n⁶⁹ Jensen, B.

Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nagreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global\nsupply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives.\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its\n72 Norris, W.

Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations\nMany analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations⁷⁴. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors\n⁷³ .'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo .(2023) .B .G ,Mueller\n⁷⁴ Carr, M. (2016). \"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\" International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition.\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software\nsupply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009⁷⁶.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations⁷⁷. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance\n⁷⁶ Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n⁷⁷ Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling⁷⁸⁷⁹⁸⁰⁸¹.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer⁸². In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub-\n⁷⁸ Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively⁸³. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence⁸⁴.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities\nPrivate actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets. The\n⁸³ Zúñiga, N. (2024). \"The geopolitics of technology standards: historical context for US, EU and Chinese approaches\". International Affairs 100(4): 1635-1652.\n⁸⁴ Zhang, A. H. (2021). Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as\nWhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa\ntion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector⁸⁵.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible⁸⁶. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities\n⁸⁵ Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n⁸⁶ Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n# 5. Conclusion\n Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.\nA political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles $^{8990}$ . Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies $^{91}$ . Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role\n88 Powers, S. M. and M. Jablonski (2015). The Real Cyber War: The Political Economy of Internet Freedom, University of Illinois Press.\n89 Lonergan, E. D.

Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast, but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting $^{93}$  in what has been characterized as an anarchical space $^{94}$ , may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives $^{95}$ .\n92 Mueller, M.

(2022). \"Fighting Alone is called Losing: The Unlearned Lessons of Fragmented Systems\".\" The Cyber Defense Review 7(1): 75-82.\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity⁹⁶.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building⁹⁷, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin-\n⁹⁶ .'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China .(2023) .I ,Group\n⁹⁷ Fick, N.

Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility¹⁰⁰.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the\n⁹⁸ Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance. The future of China's domestic political economy may well indicate its\n¹⁰¹ Blagden, D.

This article introduces a conceptual framework to discuss trust within cyberspace as an information system, and its impact on coercive power in state-state and state-private relations. Contrasting Chinese and Western cyber ecosystems reveals that leveraging domestic political economy is key in projecting national cyber power, but cyberspace itself may suffer adverse structural outcomes of increased information asymmetries, lower trust, and potential fragmentation.\n# 1. Introduction\nThere is no salient political theory of cyber statecraft. What makes a state more prone to conflict in cyberspace? What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation¹, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains. We define cyber statecraft as any methodology deployed in, on, or using tools of cyberspace to secure a state's national interests domestically and overseas, by achievement of some political, economic, societal, or technological strategic goal².\nParallels with economic statecraft are natural. Both strategically deploy instruments to deter, engage, or debilitate another; the use of Stuxnet is a canonical example in cyber conflict. Theories of economic statecraft in the interest of national security evolve with geopolitics. The Cold War cat-\n¹ Borghard, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2017). \"The Logic of Coercion in Cyberspace\". Security Studies 26(3): 452-481.\n² Economic, political or technological conflict is mediated through interdependence in cyberspace: in strategic competition over control of semiconductor supply chains for greater compute, market domination over electric vehicle and associated consumer data, subsidies in tech sector investments, and trade reciprocity in the use of consumer tech apps such as TikTok or WhatsApp in US and Chinese digital marketplaces respectively are not explicit cyber capabilities, but can all indirectly impact and influence strategic success. Legal instruments, such as China’s new counter espionage laws targeting foreign businesses, can indirectly assist in gaining leverage.\nalyzed the centrality of power to the political economy of international relations³⁴, with contemporaneous formalisms between power and interdependence⁵, and theories of economic sanctions⁶ provided a basis for the tools of economic conflict between two ideologically opposed and economically independent superpowers.\nIn the aftermath of Perestroika, the liberal perspective of political economy⁷ economic inducements of free trade and globalization, and exploiting such interdependence⁸⁹ upheld Western security interests for the first two decades of the 21st century. However, the perceived rise of China, alliances such as BRICS and SCO, Russian military interventions in Ukraine and Georgia, amongst domestic grievances in the West, such as increasing economic inequality since the 2008 financial crisis, have led scholars to pursue Marxian or structural perspectives at the nexus of economic statecraft and national security, revisiting and revising the 'weak effects' of interdependence under US hegemony during peacetime¹⁰.\n³ Knorr, K.

Structural theories on coercive strategies, such as ‘weaponized interdependence’¹¹¹² has been applied to domains of surveillance¹³, governance of Internet platforms¹⁴, telecommunications rivalries¹⁵, semiconductor manufacturing, and as policy responses to Chinese governance models¹⁶. Weaponized interdependence suggests that nation-states weaponize power asymmetries entrenched in globally networked ecosystems — such as the global financial system or the Internet — acting as ‘panopticons’ or ‘chokepoints’ to funnel or restrict information flows, respectively. However, in practice, private actors leverage their economic value in supply chains to temper states’ coercive strategies¹⁷.\nThe late 1990s emergence of early e-commerce platforms was revitalized by REST APIs in the mid 2000s, propelling social media websites into advertising powerhouses.

Despite the distributed architecture of the Internet, power concentrations are centralized in tech platforms. Any conception of 'great power cyber competition' in the realist tradition¹⁸, is bounded by the constraints owing to Internet topology, its dominant private actors, and resulting anarchical behavior in cyberspace.\nUnlike its economic analogue, cyber statecraft has no enduring collection of multilateral bodies that capture, define, or defend evolving norms in line with technological and geopolitical changes. While the UN ITU and GGE have proposed cyber norms to maintain a balance of power, even according to Tallinn 2.0, 'cyber operations are not per se regulated by international law'¹⁹. Espionage, in particular, a ubiquitous tool of statecraft, is notoriously resistant to norm emergence and governance²⁰²¹. The alignment of private sector incentives with states' contrasting political attitudes to governance, such as 'whole of society' and 'responsible power' approaches, as opposed to those that take the view of 'strategic autonomy' and 'sovereignty' in cyberspace above all, remains elusive²².\nAs a result, the relationships between state actors and private actors, such as tech platforms and third party groups that supply or exploit cyber capabilities, are largely self-determined and self-\n¹⁸ Gioe, D.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation²⁴. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n²⁴ David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n## 2. On trust\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,\nsome even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus²⁵, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’²⁶.\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n²⁵ Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n²⁶ Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.\nthat the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n\nUnreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds²⁹.\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened³⁰³¹. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu ²⁹ Kydd, A. H. (2018). Trust and Mistrust in International Relations, Princeton University Press.\n³⁰ Gambetta, Diego (ed.) (1988). Trust: Making and Breaking Cooperative Relations. Blackwell.\n³¹ Korczynski, M. (2000).\"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).\nrity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'³².\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence ³² Leonard, T. G. A., I. Krastev and Mark (2023). Living in an à la carte world: What European policymakers should learn from global public opinion, ECFR.\nand greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system Cyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyberspace social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions³³ ³⁴³⁵. Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation³⁶; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'³⁷. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n³³ Kuehl, D. T. (2011). From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem. Cyberpower and National Security. F. D. Kramer, S. H. Starr and L. K. Wentz, University of Nebraska Press.\n³⁴.Definition and Implications:Cyberspace.(2010) Lorents.and P.R,Ottis ³⁵ Clark, D. D. (2010). Characterizing cyberspace: Past, present and future.

(2013).\"Trust and context in cyberspace\".\"Archives and Records 34(2): 214-234.\nBy assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.\nWe define ecosystems³⁸ as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n³⁸ Adner, R. (2017).\"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.\nStructurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents³⁹. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n³⁹ Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000).\"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\"Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.\nIn this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection Strategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance⁴⁰, along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n⁴⁰ Cadell, C.\"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\"Reuters online (2020).\ncally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction⁴¹.\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'⁴². As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n⁴¹ Thompson, A. (2021). Buying Silence: The Price of Internet Censorship in China’, Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n⁴² Blagden, D. (2020).\"Deterring Cyber Coercion: The Exaggerated Problem of Attribution'.\"Survival 62(1): 131-148.\nThe coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'⁴³.\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains ⁴⁴ in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox⁴⁵ where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the ⁴³ Lonergan, E. D. and S. W. Lonergan (2022).\"Cyber Operations, Accommodative Signaling, and the De-Escalation of International Crises.\"Security Studies 31(1): 32-64.\n⁴⁴ Borghard, E. D. and S. W.

Forthcoming, Oxford University Press.\nalleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats⁴⁶.\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n⁴⁶ Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy. Cyber Strategy: The Evolving Character of Power and Coercion. B. Valeriano, B. Jensen and R. C. Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nChina's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage. In the domestic sphere, China views personal economic freedoms as separate from political liberties, 'contrary to Western media portrayals... [the population] does not want democracy' despite access to Western technology and the democratization of ICTs⁴⁷⁴⁸. Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries. China views deterrence and coercion as interchangeable through its philosophy of 'weishe'⁴⁹. The implications of this approach may provide useful strategic responses to China's bargaining efforts in multilateral forums towards its desired cyberspace sovereignty: in virtual or physical territories that it views as domestic — legitimately or otherwise — China's approach in leveraging its structural position and power appears to use coercive strategies by default. In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n⁴⁷ Damm, J. (2007).\"The Internet and the Fragmentation of Chinese Society'.\"Critical Asian Studies 39(2): 273-294.\n⁴⁸ Jiang, Y. (2012). Cyber-Nationalism in China.

(2020).\"The People's Republic of China's Cyber Coercion: Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the South China Sea'.\"Issues &amp; Studies 56(03): 2040013.\nGiven this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations. As such, while a common attitude of persistent coercion appears in both Chinese and Russian cyber statecraft as a means of deterrence, China’s 'wangluo quangguo' strategy of a competitive tech industry is incentivized to invest in long-term cyberspace stability⁵².\nChina’s cooperative strategies in cyberspace are an extension of its foreign policy objectives. Accrued power from established interdependencies allow China to cooperate with a state in one domain that it could coerce in another. The digital and non-digital dimensions of the Belt and Road initiative intersect in West African states where China invests in building infrastructure as a loan as part of its Belt and Road initiative, use the resulting soft power from so-called nation building, and apply it to cooperative alliances on security, such as through the 2023 Global Security Initiative⁵³⁵⁴. Any aggregated debt from Chinese investments in infrastructure-building provides future coercive instruments in cyberspace and otherwise.\nAs the dominant power within its networked ecosystem of allies, China’s signals of trustworthiness are necessary for engendering cooperation between other states in its alliance⁵⁵, thereby expanding Chinese influence in multiple domains. Indeed, the effect of previously established interdependencies and resulting cooperative strategies has consequences for substructure alliances. The exclusion of France from the 2021 AUKUS alliance for nuclear powered submarines in the Indo-Pacific created diplomatic tensions ultimately resolved in December 2023 through a bilateral security ⁵² Chinese and?Coalition of the Unwilling.(2019) Creemers.Adamson and R.L,.D,Broeders.’Russian Perspectives on Cyberspace ⁵³ Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, 2023 ⁵⁴ Curtis, S. and I.

Policymakers may assess where allied or adversarial agents are positioned structurally in a network topology to assess the impact of policies that undermine new and established trust relations, and resulting limitations on cooperative strategies.\n## 3. The aims of cyber statecraft How states decide to adopt overtly, covertly coercive, or cooperative strategies to secure national objectives, and in what proportion, is as much a function of a state and its target’s relative structural position in cyberspace, as much as a feature and limitation of cyberspace itself. Views on the governance of cyberspace are bedded in political thinking: regulatory approaches conceive of cyberspace as anarchical⁵⁷, fated to self-regulation⁵⁸, or destined for international order⁵⁹; as a social, networked space⁶⁰, full of complex actors, sometimes over-regulated and needing ‘liberal-democratic ⁵⁶ Holland, J. and E.

Despite systemic factors such as mixed success in norm-building due to role conflicts, opposing national objectives, hegemonic challenges, and examples of ‘responsible cyber power’ behavior, cyberspace is a heterogenous network where agents’ relative power governs the nature of information flows around the information system. States with sympathetic political economies attract interdependence, fluctuating in a fluid, 'territorial ontology' with networks65. States that can influence new trust processes will do so through power consolidated by entrenched interdependencies. Through cross-domain coercion, diplomatic instruments through multilateral institutions, or offensive cyber capabilities, success in the governance of a relevant part of cyberspace is structural.\n\nAs discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain⁶⁶, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability⁶⁷ incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools⁶⁸. The cost of cyber coercion is not always an advantage over other domains, as impact of covert action is easily miscalculated; 'the ⁶⁶ Kello, L.

Computers &amp; Security 72: 26-59.\ncost of Stuxnet... could have launched three cruise missile offensive strikes’⁶⁹ and the supposed 'ease of attack' may not lead to deterrence through ease in deception⁷⁰.\nDespite mixed success in signaling intentions due to a high risk of misinterpretation, scope creep by affecting unintended targets through interdependence, or miscalculation in imposed costs on both sides, overtly coercive strategies do not always produce concessions⁷¹ — possibly because the target’s structural position renders concessions more expensive than imposed by coercion, or the object of concession has been misunderstood between coercer and target. As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication. Cooperative strategies such as coalition-building in the form of establishing norms, standards, or responsible behavior ⁶⁹ Jensen, B. (2017).\"The Cyber Character of Political Warfare'.\"The Brown Journal of World Affairs 24(1): 159-172.\n⁷⁰ Gartzke, E. and J. R.

Maness, Oxford University Press: 0.\nagreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global supply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its private partnerships, despite Western intelligence agencies' high estimation of Russia's cyber capabilities⁷³. Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations Many analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations⁷⁴. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors ⁷³.'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo.(2023).B.G,Mueller ⁷⁴ Carr, M. (2016).\"Public–private partnerships in national cyber-security strategies'.\"International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 92(1): 43-62.\nThe tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software supply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009⁷⁶.\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations⁷⁷. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance ⁷⁶ Buchanan, B. (2020). Strategic Espionage. The Hacker and the State, Harvard University Press: 86-107.\n⁷⁷ Maurer, T. (2018). Cyber Mercenaries, Cambridge University Press.\ntools, but also information exfiltration tooling targeting large email platforms as well as spyware, hardware interceptors, and surveillance evasion tooling⁷⁸⁷⁹⁸⁰⁸¹.\nWhile previously identified APT and state-sponsored groups operated as now-defunct front companies for the PRC, Anxun appeared to be an independent security contractor as any private actor, headed by a former hacktivist. It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer⁸². In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub- ⁷⁸ Brazil, M.

Its 'Anti-Monopoly Law' is a dual use instrument of domestic suppression — to regulate tech platforms that are perceived to pose a domestic political threat, as with Alibaba, while simultaneously a lever in suppressing foreign businesses and other strategic fronts of competition with the US. American and European approaches to governance of technological standards are based on economically or socially undesirable consequences, respectively⁸³. In contrast China’s use of antitrust regulation as a foreign policy instrument of retaliation has significant, if economically limited, consequences as political signals to global regulatory regimes due to interdependence⁸⁴.\n## 4.2 Coercion and cooperation as strategic capabilities Private actors are subject to hierarchies of power depending on their economic status in global supply chains as high or low value. They interact ‘horizontally’ with other private actors of relative higher or lower values, ‘vertically’ with the state in its legislative and regulatory roles, as well as irregularly with foreign states by forming economic partnerships or becoming security targets. The ⁸³ Zúñiga, N. (2024).\"The geopolitics of technology standards: historical context for US, EU and Chinese approaches\". International Affairs 100(4): 1635-1652.\n⁸⁴ Zhang, A. H. (2021). Weaponizing Antitrust During the Sino-US Tech War’. A. H. Zhang, Oxford University Press.\ntopology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as WhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa tion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector⁸⁵.\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible⁸⁶. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities ⁸⁵ Zhang, A. H. (2024). High Wire: How China Regulates Big Tech and Governs Its Economy, Oxford University Press.\n⁸⁶ Fujino, I. (2024). Huawei breaks free from Google ecosystem with homegrown OS, Nikkei Asia.\nties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n# 5. Conclusion [87] Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.\nA political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles. Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies. Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role contexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting in what has been characterized as an anarchical space, may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives.\n\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity⁹⁶.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building⁹⁷, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin- ⁹⁶.'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China.(2023).I,Group ⁹⁷ Fick, N. (2022).\"Confronting Reality in Cyberspace: Foreign Policy for a Fragmented Internet.\"Council on Foreign Relations.\nancial crisis⁹⁸, and abandoned a liberal economic approach⁹⁹. Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility¹⁰⁰.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the ⁹⁸ Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance.

What makes states such as North Korea decide on using instruments of sabotage or extortion, such as ransomware, as appropriate instruments of statecraft, while others, such as Russia or China, use their capabilities to target dominant tech platforms and global supply chains through sophisticated 'living-off-the-land' techniques? Why do some prefer to have stronger defensive postures than offensive capabilities, such as Germany before its 2023 Zeitenwende? Why do seemingly liberal democracies engage in the facilitation of spyware on their civil societies? Understanding state\nintentions in cyberspace is increasingly necessary due to the 'high risk of misperception' and potential for conflict escalation¹, but difficult when intentions are not obvious.\nStates adopt varying heuristics in conducting relations with others over cyberspace: some may see it as a continuation of long-standing 'information operations' to maintain or increase dominance, others as newer ground for espionage, coercion or subversion, and still others as a means for strategic advancement through intellectual property theft, extortion, or expanding foreign influence. The use of statecraft in cyberspace may signal political, military or economic intentions in other domains.

As Chen and Evers point out, 'business-state relations ... shape the effectiveness of economic statecraft' and '... as two [rising and dominant] states ... seek to maximize their relative power ... resulting disruption to profits leads high-value businesses to develop more conflictual relations with the dominant state in which they are based.' States must contend with domestic economic challenges posed by businesses while balancing foreign policy objectives. Those especially susceptible to protectionism in trade policy face the increased cost of breaking out from interdependent structures, and use cyber statecraft as a potential means of reducing this cost.\nIn cyberspace, primarily a system of interdependent information flows, states' abilities to exercise coercion or cooperation strategies to achieve domestic or foreign security objectives depend on navigating trust and power relations with key private actors, as well as adversarial or allied states. In this article, we present a conceptual framework on the effect of trust relations on cyber power, public-private and private-private interdependence, and accordingly, evolving cyber statecraft. Trust, an independent variable, is conceptualized as a process inside the information system that preserves the properties of information flowing between two agent(s) as remaining private or public, resulting in the creation of some mutually beneficial, or public, good. The process may be used by the agent to signal their trustworthiness, forming cooperative relations and fomenting interdependence, and the resulting structural implications on power (Fig 1).\nSeeing trust as a process variable in an information system, rather than a purely normative phenomenon allows us to reconcile its extant formulations: as a concept in computer network security; as a political or personal social phenomenon; and as an action of economic agency. Concurrent concepts in literature take on different vocabularies; in appraising China's asymmetric statecraft, for\nFigure 1: A conceptual framework in an information system highlighting the structural dependence of the systemic variable, power, on the process variable, trust, through new and established interdependencies. An actor's ability to deploy and leverage strategies such as cooperation or coercion depend on its structural position vis-a-vis interdependence and relative power.\nexample, 'alignment' is used as an implicit substitute for trust $^{23}$ , characterized as a property of a relationship. Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela\ntionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation²⁴. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n²⁴ David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.\ncording to a nation-state’s domestic political economy. The Chinese cyber ecosystem is a running example throughout the article. Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n\n---\n\n## # 5. Conclusion [87] Huang, Y. (2023). China’s Asymmetric Statecraft: Alignments, Competitors, and Regional Diplomacy, UBC Press.\n\nA political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles. Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies. Its British and American counterparts, the National Cyber Force and US Cyber Command, have published responsible behavioral standards, and touted efficient use of taxpayer funds. Capturing the specific, complex role contexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting in what has been characterized as an anarchical space, may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives.\nThe paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity⁹⁶.\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building⁹⁷, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise. In particular, the adaptiveness of nation-states to leverage their domestic public-private relationships to achieve foreign policy objectives. Chinese analysts appear to have noted growing divergences in American and European domestic political economies, security outcomes arising from the 2008 fin- ⁹⁶.'s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power'Charting China.(2023).I,Group ⁹⁷ Fick, N.

Top-down, centralized leadership in China has enabled rapid coercion to control tech platforms domestically. Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility¹⁰⁰.\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example. Offensive cyber operations originating from ‘CRINK’ can spark two opposing types of policy recommendations: to either retaliate against the 'common interest' rather than the ⁹⁸ Xiaohong, Y. (2013).

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator. Russia's alleged military alliance with North Korea two years into the Ukraine war may compel the Chinese to either undermine North Korea by assuming the role of primary supplier, or coerce Russia into otherwise decreasing its reliance. The future of China's domestic political economy may well indicate its ¹⁰¹ Blagden, D.

Regardless, the benefit of reconciling various approaches to trust helps explain perceived inconsistencies in an agent's behaviors towards others, for instance, states increasingly form relationships based on a wider set of choices rather than relying the influence of a single power axis, as well as structural implications on power of trust relations shifting from 'what to trust' to 'who to trust', as seen on social media.\n\nThe exploitation of these trust relationships, through either indirect exploitation of interdependence, such as 'influence operations' that redirect information flows in favorable directions, or through direct exploitation of power, through coercive strategies in the form of offensive cyber operations, form the basis of cyber statecraft. For example, a state like North Korea, which has no trust rela",
    "tionships, and therefore interdependencies, with Western allies, has impunity to exercise coercive cyber power in the extreme by using ransomware to target its adversaries' civil society and critical national infrastructure, as seen in the WannaCry case. It may impose the maximum possible cost on its adversaries, short of escalating severe conflict strategies.\n\nOn the other hand, among the Five Eyes, trust relationships formed as a result of the collective means that intelligence as a commodity is interdependent; it would be too expensive for each member to gather intelligence in isolation²⁴. As such, members are more likely to use the least coercive means possible to achieve their objectives; usually through passive surveillance, as suggested in the Snowden leaks regarding US surveillance on Germany. The manner of exploiting trust — and its structural power implications — are signaled by the adversary's strategic interests, ultimately derived from its political economy in concert with other diplomatic, military, or economic tools.\n\nThis article makes three contributions: first, the conceptual framework introduces trust as a process variable on which power depends in the form of cooperative or coercive strategies. There are few explicit links between trust and power in extant security studies literature. In particular, a definition of trust as a process that changes the property of information flows, builds a relationship between the concepts of systems in computer science and management, and structures in international relations, adding a systems-view to scholarship on statecraft. Second, we use the conceptual framework to reason about optimal strategies of statecraft, such as cooperation or coercion in cyberspace, ac\n\n²⁴ David Baldwin characterizes economic interdependence as the 'opportunity cost' it would take to break out of the structure. Synergies in cyberspace include the cost incurred by an agent to leave a network due to a trust relationship that is no longer desirable, such as a security alliance, or some too-expensive redundancy, such as free-riding on a dominant agent(s) for a public good, such as security, when it is no longer in the dominant agent's interest to keep providing. The other type of cost is the maximum possible imposed on an adversary, to achieve some behavioral outcome, through a coercive strategy like offensive cyber operations.",

Third, we discuss the benefits and limitations of statecraft in cyberspace, given its interdependencies in political and economic systems, and how a nation-state’s structural position may prove advantageous to these strategies, at the risk of maintaining stability.\n\nSection 2 provides a systemic definition of trust, discuss applications to cyberspace, and implications on strategies of cooperation and coercion. Section 3 discusses the aims of cyber statecraft, the benefits and limitations of using these instruments on creating or ending trusted relationships, and the networked actor ecosystems under consideration. In Section 4, we outline public-private actor relations, discuss the conflict in the state’s roles and impact to trust and power relations. Section 5 concludes with a summary of policy and structural implications, potential future work on modeling trust dynamics, and a discussion of complexity and limitations of the framework.\n\n## 2. On trust\n\n### 2.1 Many faces, many actors\n\nThe conceptual treatment of trust in different literatures is inconsistent. Across the social sciences, trust is presented as either a capacity in, or as a social value 'given' by, one actor to another in exchange for meeting a social or economic expectation. Sociologists have formulated typologies of trust relationships between the government, through the roles its institutions play towards societies and citizenry, in describing contexts such as power hierarchies. Economists tend to use trust as an implicit property of a transaction that provides a basis for cooperative strategies between actors,",
    "some even repudiating the need for an explicit concept as unnecessary to economic calculus²⁵, relying on norms assumed to be mutually known, shared, and understood.\n\nTrust in sociology is chiefly employed as a concept of organizational and management theory. Although there is no consistent definition across management theory, trust is used as a device for describing incentives in institutional actors and as behavioral support for decision-making over, for example, resource allocation. In international relations, trust is implicit, yet again, describing relationships between states; in particular as a conduit in reducing uncertainty and ‘Hobbesian’ fear between dominant and challenger states, in firmly established concepts such as deterrence theory and security dilemmas. In computer science and related fields such as cybersecurity, trust is viewed as a by-product of an access control policy, controlling information flows between two computer systems, and has led to popular computer network security architectures such as those based on ‘zero trust’²⁶.\n\nIn summary, trust has been defined, variously, as a property in, product of, or a feature of a transaction between actors. Where this property is present, trust is a descriptor of the relationship between 'trustworthy' actors. As a property of a transaction, it is dependent on the participating actor's agency; their choice of strategies, based on beliefs, incentives, preference sets or some other relevant outcome calculus. Sabel, for example, adopts the definition that trust is 'the mutual confidence\n\n²⁵ Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n\n²⁶ Ward, R. and B. Beyer (2014). \"Beyondcorp: a new approach to enterprise security\".;login:: the magazine of USENIX &amp; SAGE 39(6): 6-11.",
    "that the other party to an exchange will not exploit one's vulnerabilities'27. The inherent reciprocity assumed in this definition is a departure from its sociological counterparts that describe institutional power, for example. In reasoning about market power and behavior, a 'political economy' of trust28 organizes a taxonomy of different perspectives in literature on the bases of confidence factors between actors, such as structural considerations or mutual knowledge of norms. These bases are used to establish a notion of 'high' and 'low' trust economies, bridging sociological and economic literatures.\n\nHowever, conceptual formulations of trust as a relationship descriptor present some limitations to analyzing behavior as it is revealed, rather than expected, possibly because underlying assumptions about factors such as norms, reciprocity, vulnerabilities, shared incentives, and information asymmetries remain implicit. How trust is interpreted becomes highly relative; the observer outside an actor's frame of reference interprets a possible trust relationship through their own beliefs — for example, beliefs arising from their own political systems — but the actors conducting the relationship inside the frame of reference may have a different, selective, or more granular view towards those with whom they enter into trust relations and form networks. Trust relations may not be mutual; the direction of information flows from the truster to the trustee and may not be reciprocated. As networks become more complex, multiple trust relations are established through constituent information flows. Actors create a dependence on those they share information with — the recipient carries the dependent's expectation of not perverting the information flow.\n\n27 Williamson, O. E. (1993). \"Calculativeness, Trust, and Economic Organization.\" The Journal of Law and Economics 36(1, Part 2): 453-486.\n\n28 Korczynski, M. (2000). \"The Political Economy of Trust\". Journal of Management Studies 37(1).",
    "Unreciprocated trust creates heterogeneity in the quantity and properties of information known to actors in a network, in turn, creating information asymmetries between actors. Recipients who exploit this asymmetrical interdependence have greater relative capabilities to exercise cooperative or coercive strategies in their neighbors; we define the ability to exert these strategies as an actor's relative power in a system. While conceptual formulations of trust explain the structural effects of power on trust relations, they do not identify the structural effect of trust on power relations. Andrew Kydd has gamified the effects of power on trust relations, for example, to argue that at the time of US hegemony as a 'solitary superpower', 'the structural features of the post-Cold War era indicate that US foreign policy may... raise world suspicions of US motivations' and that, post-Iraq, the US 'will need to implement a policy of reassurance,' especially towards defection-prone states with high-trust thresholds²⁹.\n\nThe structural effect of trust on power relations, however, is the cause of gradual relational changes, such as power transitions or new interdependencies. A structure may represent a collection of networks representing a market, institution, or organizational hierarchy. In 'high trust' market economies, relative power is balanced among actors; in 'low-trust' economies, institutions are weakened³⁰³¹. In cyberspace, the result of globally interdependent information flows has been to allow actors a greater choice in who they share information with. Strategic choice is a second, implied limitation of previous conceptualizations of trust. Conceptualized as an actor's capacity, trust corroborates the 'spheres of influence' theory in international relations, but may be inadequate in explaining perceived inconsistencies in states' behaviors, given a greater choice of potential trust partners. Middle powers such as India and Saudi Arabia have seemingly contradicting stances on secu\n\n²⁹ Kydd, A. H. (2018).

    "rity and trade, in relation with the US position on Russia since the war on Ukraine. Middle and emerging powers increasingly operate in an 'à la carte world'³².\n\nBoth limitations, in their inability to explain how power relations are affected by trust, arise due to implicit social, political and economic assumptions, possibly as these analyses are restricted to trust observed in a dyadic relationship behavior, as opposed to the relationship being conducted in a wider system with multiple frames of social, political, and economic references. As such, the so-called 'trustworthiness' of actors is neither homogeneous across networks, nor consistent within actor relationships. Modeling methodologies such as rational-actor game theoretic treatments can omit the cause and network effects of multiple, many directional informational flows, arbitrated by pluralistic views of actors' trustworthiness. As recorded in social network literature and revealed on social media, these network effects account for much of the 'who to trust' phenomenon, over information integrity, as discussed earlier. Over a long-running network, the focus on dyadic relations and implicit assumptions result in exacerbating information asymmetries; the worst effects of actor-based, rather than information-based, trust processes is seen in the rise of disinformation on social networks, in turn reinforcing the erosion of social trust.\n\nFinally, while extant treatments in sociology and economics literatures use trust to form a basis for cooperative interaction between actors, they do not provide explicit or rigorous reasoning for seemingly inconsistent behavior, such as an actor with some relative power using an established cooperative relationship in one strategic domain to coerce an ally into showing cooperative behavior in another strategic domain. Given the cross-domain nature of statecraft spread over political, economic, military, diplomatic, and now, cyber information systems, structural advantages of interdependence\n\n³² Leonard, T. G.

    "and greater relative power in one domain may allow for greater bargaining in relationships in other domains. In this article, we use the conceptual framework to overcome some of these limitations by not assuming homogeneity in political and economic factors in analyzing cyber statecraft, but by basing trust relationships in the context of state actors' domestic political economies.\n\nA state's ability to choose between cooperative or coercive strategies in cyberspace, and the success of these strategies in achieving national objectives and intended leverage, relies on state-state relationships vis-a-vis foreign policies, the mobilization of the state's domestic private sector — such as its tech industry, critical infrastructure providers, researchers, or third parties sponsored by the state — as well as incentivizing key foreign private sectors to cooperate, for example, by providing market access. The extent and nature of each strategy, 'vertical' or 'horizontal' in the power arrangement of public-private and private-private relations, respectively, is determined by political economic variables of trust, interdependence, and power. Cyberspace, as an information system, offers domain-specific features that enable states with opposing political economies to exercise cooperative and coercive strategies of statecraft, given their relative power and degree of interdependence.\n\n## 2.2 In cyberspace as an information system\n\nCyberspace is the collection of all networked computer-based information systems. There is more consensus in literature about the characteristics of cyberspace than its definition; operators and users, or in our vocabulary, 'actors', digital technology, and information communication give cyber-",
    "space social, political, economic, technological and military dimensions³³ ³⁴³⁵. Accordingly, trust in cyberspace has been variously conceptualized as a system-level property of 'trustworthiness', where a system acts according to expectation³⁶; maintained by 'transparency' of the provenance of data and 'objectivity'³⁷. This technocratic, system-level view of trust has motivated many secure computer network architecture models, based on the principle that systems integrity is key to preventing distrust, especially in conflict domains.\n\nThe concept of trust in this article is similarly based in informational integrity; it does not presuppose the characteristic property of a system, rather, as a process variable within an information system, associated to an actor as part of their agency. Trustworthiness is a structural property in an actor; as the perception of an actor's ability to execute a trust process changes, so does the observer's beliefs of the actor's trustworthiness. As a result of the conceptual framework, the relative power of actors is a system variable, dependent on trust. Specifically, it is the power, compared to other actors, of the ability to deploy coercive or cooperative strategies on to targets in service of some objective. The mutually beneficial, or public, good, that arises from a trust relation becomes the source of leverage. In cyberspace, the framework establishes a relationship between 'structures', or networks in international relations, and 'systems', as understood in computational and management literature.\n\n³³ Kuehl, D.

    "By assigning a common taxonomy to actor behaviors, structural bounds on their beliefs and relative agency, a dynamic theory of power relations emerges: by adding to the literature on existing theories of structural power competitions, such as 'weaponized interdependence', we discuss how state-state and state-private relations, in concert, underlie national power projections. Changes in these relations initiate entrenched power transfer or imbalances, albeit slowly, as opposed to a 'steady state' model of initial power configurations exacerbating over time. In particular, a more dynamic approach to trust and power relations can be adapted to both 'great power' as well as middle and emerging power behaviors, given that structures both facilitate and temper power simultaneously; the framework does not assume its bases in a liberal international political economy.\n\nCyberspace, imbued with social, political, economic and technological character, must accommodate overlaps with financial, political, and societal information systems through pervasive digital technologies which act as communication channels. Financial transactions and political discourse are increasingly conducted in cyberspace, for example, and weaponized. The overlap in these information systems provides a foundation for reconciling computational, personal or political, and economic definitions of trust. Any instrument of statecraft, such as overt or covert action, must balance the structural considerations of relative power vis-a-vis these overlapping information systems. In an information system, instruments of statecraft are the set of strategies available to an actor, where the cost of deploying a strategy depends on the initiator and target's relative structural position. In cyberspace, these strategies are deployed through legal, economic, political, or technological action in ecosystems.",
    "We define ecosystems³⁸ as self-forming substructures around the economic character of a digital technology. This definition motivates states’ leveraging their political economies with regards public-private relations and the relative economic value extracted by private actors. Typically, the economic character is some demand-supply based resource transaction, such as disclosing personal information to a tech company in exchange for personal or social utility derived from its products. Tech platforms are incentivized to create ecosystems with closed feedback loops to retain consumer trust. On the other hand, economic character based around the demand for commodities, such as spyware, engages a collection of ecosystems of public and private actors researching different technology stacks, with a commercial organization such as an exploit vendor delivering the offensive capability to state or state-sponsored actors. Ecosystems are networked through such information transactions: public ecosystems are accessible to all agents in the wider system, private ecosystems require new trust relations to be formed or broken for agents to enter or leave.\n\nAn agent may establish or improve its 'trustworthiness' if it can use its agency and resources to signal to other agents that it is able to execute a trust process, and the receiving agents accept the signal. Trust is improved over multiple, possibly repeated transactions; a relationship is a mutually trusted one when process execution is bilateral between agents. The perception of a trusted relationship between two agents may initiate trustworthiness signals in a third agent, execute a new process, and the network expands. In cyber statecraft, as in the case of economic statecraft, interdependencies formed as a consequence of expanding networks are exploited by agents in structurally favorable positions directly, or through proxies. While some ecosystems may be networked, other networks may not have overlapping ecosystems, such as ideological separate political information systems in the Cold War, despite economic interdependencies.\n\n³⁸ Adner, R. (2017). \"Ecosystem as Structure: An Actionable Construct for Strategy\". Journal of Management 43(1): 39-58.",
    "Structurally favorable positions lead to power hierarchies, formed initially as a result of some trust process such as voting for a political party in a democratic election, but then reinforced through cooperative or coercive strategies by the resulting government on to the 'citizen' agent. Political trust, and the trustworthiness of a government actor, signaled in its policies and institutions can affect interpersonal trust between agents³⁹. In cyberspace, both personal and political trust as social phenomenon are reflected through information intermediaries, such as social media platforms, which are a natural target for coercive strategies such as so-called influence operations from state actors of varying relative power. By attempting to manipulate existing or new trust processes through offensive cyber capabilities, the coercer attempts to reroute information flows that form the basis for social trust.\n\nOn the other hand, states in unfavorable structural positions, or lower relative power, find themselves compensating by imposing more defensive costs in their targets if there are no interdependencies, or if the cost of an offensive incurred is lower than breaking indirect interdependencies. In defensive capacities, as seen with strategic choice, they may instead appeal to structurally better positioned actors through offering one-sided economic or political inducements, or cooperating in another information system in exchange for free-riding benefits from the better positioned actor's security offering. As any first-mover advantage is limited in relatively lower power actors, they are more likely to be targets of coercion in strategic competition between states of approaching power parities.\n\n³⁹ Levi, M. and L. Stoker (2000). \"Political Trust and Trustworthiness'.\" Annual Review of Political Science 3: 475-507.",
    "In this article, we are concerned with cyber statecraft firstly in the context of state-state relations, such as through instruments like foreign policy or covert strategies, directly on to the target state or through a proxy. Secondly, in state-private relations, where a state either attempts to leverage domestic policies to extract a political outcome through engaging with a private actor operating within its jurisdiction, or it exploits an interdependence forged through an ecosystem such as a supply chain between a domestic private actor with a target foreign private actor.\n\nThe latter strategy, in turn, is implicitly aimed at some strategic competitor state, which houses the target foreign private actor. Direct strategies of statecraft include inducing cooperation in, or coercing, a competing state through security coalitions or covert cyber operations. Indirect strategies of statecraft target private sector supply chain interdependence, and success depends on the initiating state's structural position in trust networks. These structural positions determine relative power in both public and private actors; the surrounding cyberspace as networked information systems takes on the political and economic character of these actors.\n\n## 2.3 Coercion and deterrence, cooperation and defection\n\nStrategic leverage is gained as a result of coercive or cooperative dynamics; successful statecraft must calculate the appropriate balance. Our conceptual framework supplies additional perspectives in the logic of coercion: where trust relations create structural conditions such as new or retrenched interdependencies, agents bid to consolidate domain power, determining how effective any coercive strategy can be, whether domestic or foreign. The CCP's exploitation of social network trust dynamics through account mining and surveillance⁴⁰ (Cadell, 2021), along with an estimated $7 billion spend annually on Internet censorship nationwide helps shape its influence operations domestically.\n\n⁴⁰ Cadell, C. \"China's coronavirus campaign offers glimpse into surveillance system.\" Reuters online (2020).",
    "cally by suppressing dissent, and internationally by profiling skeptics and generating noise as distraction⁴¹.\n\nCoercion is an offensive strategy deployed on a target agent to deter a behavioral outcome. Applied in an information system, coercion addresses an informational asymmetry by bypassing, manipulating, or denying the execution of a target's trust process, in order to deter the target's intended outcome. The strategic rationale behind the coercive method depends on some cost calculus; successful coercion can achieve deterrence at a cost-benefit advantage to the coercer, mostly by increasing defense costs for the target, or by deploying cheaper instruments to punish the target than up to some threshold of conflict escalation.\n\nThrough cyberspace, as in other mediums of coercion, the desired change in the target's behavioral outcome is in '... align[ment] with the coercer's political, social and economic preferences... coercion serves as a mechanism of [the attacker's] preference revelation'⁴². As an offensive strategy on the target's political economy, coercion in cyberspace is exposed to the same structural considerations vis-à-vis the effects of power and interdependence on coercive abilities (Fig 1). Operationally, the coercer either attempts cyberattacks that may cause a denial of service, exfiltrate data, or more generally, reroute information flows, or the use of a legal instrument that disproportionately increases the cost of target defense.\n\n⁴¹ Thompson, A.

    "The coercer's structural position and relative power within an ecosystem determines both its access to such an offensive cyber capability, as well as the resulting cost of coercion, based on the target's relative power and the expected effect of the cyberattack. Similarly, the target's structural position and relative power determines the credibility of the coercer's perceived threat. Through our trust framework, we ascribe two character types to coercion: overtly coercive strategies such as cyberattacks on critical national and civilian infrastructure that (are intended to) threaten domestic, political trust-based structures. Covertly coercive strategies, such as espionage and most counterintelligence operations in cyberspace, targeting specific, powerful actors in heterogenous networks, may be more expensive for the coercer, but carry lesser weight on the need for public attribution, instead, acting as 'accommodative signals'⁴³.\n\nBoth types of coercion are intended to fill a 'leverage deficit', albeit in different ways. There is broad consensus among cyber coercion scholars that the cyber domain alone is insufficient in producing a concessionary outcome than when used in conjunction with other domains ⁴⁴ in part due to the so-called 'stability-instability' paradox⁴⁵ where damage incurred due to cyberattacks is minimal despite cyberspace being an unstable system. However, why some coercive strategies in the cyber domain remain more or less successful at producing strategic outcomes remains to be explained; for example, the seemingly limited success of Chinese cyber espionage in evoking concessions, or the\n\n⁴³ Lonergan, E.

    "alleged success of the US model of combining espionage, cyber degradations and economic threats⁴⁶.\n\nIn responding to overtly coercive outcomes, the target state has to defend its resilience domestically to its society and industry to maintain trust. Since China’s 2014 compromise of the US Office of Personnel Management through the People’s Liberation Army and one of several Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups associated with it, the position of the US and its allies towards such coercive strategies has increasingly become public attribution. In recent years, the Five Eyes have been vocal about the Volt Typhoon intrusion into Microsoft, another APT using lateral movement techniques, attributed to the Chinese state, and its additional, alleged role in compromising defense personnel records in the UK.\n\nThrough transparent national strategies, keeping their populaces informed and partnering with their private sectors on defense, Western allies seek to maintain trust relations with their societies and one another, and this transparency is claimed by the body politic to be consistent with their liberal democratic political systems. On the other hand, the lack of public attribution of Western cyberattacks by target states like China and Russia is explained by Western analysts as owing to their illiberal systems of government, to prevent admitting weakness, in accordance with their attitude towards trust, and containing dissent. There are no records of attributing offensive cyber activity or passive surveillance attempts between China and Russia either, despite deepening trade, security, and political relations. Repeated instances of public attributions by the West have not deterred China from pursuing coercive strategies in cyberspace.\n\n⁴⁶ Valeriano, B. (2018). Cyber Coercion as a Combined Strategy.

    "China's political economy helps in analyzing its attitudes towards public attribution, choice of coercive strategies, and how it views its own structural position and relative power in a cyberspace it has long sought to free from interdependencies that create information asymmetries to its disadvantage.

Additionally, in what it perceives to be its domestic sphere, China's coercive strategies in Hong Kong and the Taiwan Strait are a further indication of its attitude towards trust.\n\nChina's attitude to maintaining trust appears to be based on increasing information asymmetries.

In summary, in both its foreign and domestic relations within cyberspace, China's coercive approach to promoting its national interests results from, and reinforces growing relative and absolute power, respectively.\n\n⁴⁷ Damm, J.

    "Given this structural advantage, responses to cyberattacks in the form of economic sanctions applied by Western states on individuals actors such as Chinese military personnel or civilian hackers has very limited to no deterrent effects, leading to supply chain sanctions on high-value businesses such as Huawei 5G. As such, offensive cyber activity is normalized in China's information operations to the point of being a 'strategic substitute' in compensating for military shortcomings, and as a gauge for reprisals to show of power through coercive strategies like 'brinkmanship'50. China has no structural incentive to deter from using coercive strategies; its relative power in an interdependent cyberspace assures that any significant deterrence would be structural, and its cost also borne by the coercer. Despite its desire for Internet sovereignty, much of China's impunity is owed to interdependence.\n\nNew scholarship since the Ukraine war on evolving Russian attitudes towards deterrence in cyberspace describes the lack of a coherent, current doctrine in anticipation of the Kremlin's objective of information sovereignty, but theorizes the concept of 'cumulative coercion', derived from historical and cultural factors, that — similar to China — conflates with 'strategic deterrence' as '... constant low-intensity engagement of the adversary... unlimited use of limited force'51. Conflict and coercion are described as interchangeable parts of an overarching influence and shaping strategy with little difference between offensive and defensive operations.

    "As discussed before, cyber statecraft may lend itself to natural comparisons with economic statecraft as a means of securing national objectives, even though cyberspace and the global financial system aren't isomorphically governable. Both types of statecraft leverage domestic business relationships to achieve national security objectives, but may not be seen mutually exhaustively. Legal and regulatory measures also exist at the nexus of the two information systems, for example, export controls on spyware. Sanctions display 'negative' power, causing denial of gain⁶⁶, but in recent years denial of service attacks on protocols and platforms such as the DNS provider Dyn and Amazon Web Services, show similar effects through downtime in digital economies. The effects of punitive economic measures may be felt quickly and publicly; the same is not true for covertly coercive cyber strategies. But contradictions in operationalizing cyber statecraft further limit its success as an effective coercive strategy.\n\nStates must develop long-term trust relations with actors who perform offensive cyber operations by permission or in partnership. These semi-private actors, mercenaries, or APT groups must balance high degradation of cyber capabilities with persistent offensive engagement. This 'transitory nature' of offensive cyber capability⁶⁷ incentivizes states to limit access to new capabilities through legislative means or by disclosure, causing immediate degradation, and in turn also limiting accessibility and development of exploits for private actors who share such tools⁶⁸.

As a strategic substitute, persistent coercive engagement is seen as ‘fair game’ by China and Russia as 'low-intensity conflict behavior'. Other covertly coercive strategies as a result of civil society surveillance have either leveled the structural disadvantages of smaller states, for instance through commercial spyware getting cheaper over time before Western moratoria, or consolidated power in pre-existing information 'panopticons' through weaponized interdependence.\n\nSo why cyber statecraft? Coercive strategies such as cyberattacks in the past decade have verified that cyberspace is no equalizer, but rewards existing structural asymmetries of power that determine coercive success. Smaller states without coherent national cyber strategies or digital resources are disproportionately affected by cyberattacks of varying technical sophistication.

    "agreements either favor coalitions of sympathetic political economies, or elicit little recourse for misdemeanors. Losing the offender’s trust may be too expensive vis-a-vis upholding cooperative relations in other domains, with few levers to deter undesirable actions without risking volatility in a coalition, and punishment is simply too expensive. The utility of cyber statecraft, particularly in its overtly coercive forms, must not be exaggerated.\n\nHowever, coercion in cyberspace can disproportionately favor middle powers as well as challengers to hegemons in asymmetric networks as they lack the economic power to impose loss through sanctions. Established powers find themselves in a defensive position by default — due to unpredictability and obfuscation of the challenger’s objectives, as Kello observes — and are better equipped to initiative cooperative strategies that passively exploit a priori interdependencies. As opposed to the financial system as an information system, cyberspace suffers from a lesser burden of authentication, verification and audit in transactions, and can act as a gateway to other domains that leverage ICTs with controlled risk. Networks in cyberspace, like the Internet, were initially designed without security protocols in TCP/IP, and security features such as sender-recipient validation were added in layers; routing information flows requires a lower technical and resource cost than in networks such as, for example, SWIFT.\n\nWhile the creation of new trust relationships and structural change in existing power asymmetries favoring agents with lower relative power in an ecosystem may be limited, it is much easier for these agents to undermine trust relations between other agents with higher relative power. This is a product of the heterogenous nature of anarchy in cyberspace, that states not bound to cooperative coalitions need not adhere to 'responsible' behavior, and is a comparative advantage of cyber statecraft. Additionally, while economic punishments in response to cyber coercion may come at a disadvantage to the target, as sanctions affect businesses with high levels of interdependence in global",
    "supply chains, responses in cyberspace to economic coercion impose cost on the defender. For structurally less significant nation-states, the benefits of cyber statecraft aren't absolute, but incremental and comparative than from other domains; it may not yield concessions, but increase bargaining power.\n\nThe hegemon is incentivized to preserve the balance of power and need only engage asymmetrically in specific, tactical conditions, as it can wield far more influence through cross-domain engagement; the challenger seeks to break this status quo and must, strategically, engage asymmetrically. Over time, covertly coercive strategies such as influence operations based on disinformation, or more sophisticated persistent engagement, can alter trust relations in the target's domestic structures, extending to existing cooperative strategies with foreign partners. In this case, the style of statecraft adopted by a nation-state in domains such as trade and finance are indicative of the overall posture and political economy, which may serve as predictors of cyberspace behavior. For example, Chinese economic statecraft targets domestic political economic actors directly, through the state taking a 'king-making role' that favors commercial entities who espouse state objectives[72].\n\nSo far, the conceptual framework describes the dynamics between adversarial or allied nation-states, where interdependence arises from trust processes between agents in networked ecosystems. Nation-states must also leverage their private-public sector relations efficiently to achieve political, economic and social objectives in cyberspace. Some analysts attribute the difference between the expected damage and sabotage to critical national infrastructure caused by Russian offensive cyber operations, as opposed to the more passive reality of greater espionage attempts and influence operations since the Ukraine war at least in part due to the inability of the Russian state to mobilize its\n\n72 Norris, W.

Complex interdependence extends to the private sector through global supply chains; we offer a graduated view of the actors involved, their relationships with the state, and implications for structures and statecraft.\n\n## 4. Public-private actor structural relations\n\nMany analyses of public-private relations in national cyber strategies tend to focus on relationships between the state and business, where the 'privateness' of the business actor extends, in particular, to technology industry ecosystems such as consumer platforms or infrastructure providers, which operate with a degree of independence from the state, consistent with market economy-based governance systems. However, unclear separation of duties in operational matters of technology security and undesirable market effects in the private sector can create national security vulnerabilities from asymmetric public-private power relations⁷⁴. Additionally, given the aims and instruments of cyber statecraft, we must consider a number of private actors that states seek to leverage through coercive abilities arising from their domestic political economies. In particular, roles played by third party actors such as cyber mercenaries, hacker-for-hire and/or APT groups, and providers of offensive cyber capabilities, are subject to varying degrees of state control, which is a key determinant of strategic success in cyberspace.\n\n## 4.1 The 'privateness' of actors\n\n⁷³ .'Ukrainian War-Cyber Operations during the Russo .(2023) .B .G ,Mueller\n⁷⁴ Carr, M.

    "The tech industry actor offers services that are consumed by societies within competing states. Whether through direct interaction on consumer platforms such as social media, or indirect interaction in providing the state and other industries with underlying infrastructure needed to operate digital economies or coordinate physical infrastructure, the tech industry plays a pivotal role in mediating societal attitudes towards their governments. States are incentivized to cooperate with, or coerce, tech industrial actors domestically to maintain or entrench a political status quo. However, tech businesses create online ecosystems that are designed to 'gate-keep' user information, satisfying their engagement-based business models.\n\nThe ability of the actor to keep information flows private results in an economic good, motivating the property of 'privateness'. To compete with other businesses in digital marketplaces, they form informational interdependencies as part of global supply chains. From these supply chains, businesses extract 'high' and 'low' economic values, that govern their negotiating strategies with their respective states; dominant states are, furthermore, more likely to play home state to high-value businesses, setting up inter-state competition[75].\n\nPrivate-sector interdependencies vary; the provision of low-level materials such as semiconductor chips to increase computing power and compete on the new strategic frontier of language learning models; critical national infrastructure such as telecommunications, for example, the soon-to-be-reversed reliance of British Telecom on Huawei equipment for lower fidelity cellular services such as 2G and 3G, or the removal of Android from Huawei OS due to US export control; marketplace mediations, such as Apple's removal of WhatsApp from the Chinese App Store; low-level software",
    "supply chain interdependence such as the use of another provider's software libraries in, for example, cryptographic protocols. The resulting economic value or public good is a target for overt or covert action through cyberspace; states are also incentivized to target tech companies internationally to undermine a competitor state's objectives, as seen in Operation Aurora, the Chinese state espionage campaign on Google in 2009⁷⁶.\n\nThe tension between the state's coercive abilities as an offensive actor and a company's defensive posture as potential attack surface varies based on economic advantages from the company's structural position as a defensive strategy, as well as its ability to respond to state coercion. Such power dynamics are less volatile for other, (less) private actors, such as state-sponsored mercenaries or exploit vendors, as their incentives are derived from regular state patronage. In general, states form long-term trust relations with cyber mercenaries to compensate for lack of in-house capability or achieve national objectives through arms-length covertly coercive operations⁷⁷. However, leaks on the code repository GitHub in February 2024 containing a dump of documents belonging to a Chinese government contractor, Anxun (i-Soon), long associated with APT-41, provides meta-analyses into the Chinese offensive cyber ecosystem.\n\nFirst, Anxun is understood to have had contracts with the Chinese government at state and provincial levels, undertaking hacking activities targeting both international economic actors, such as Canadian firm Com100, as well as fulfilling its regional statecraft ambitions in central and east Asia, as well as smaller African nations. Second, Anxun developed training materials for burgeoning offensive cyber practitioners. Third, it developed and provided not just low-level surveillance\n\n⁷⁶ Buchanan, B. (2020).

It also appears to have had a much larger scope of work vis-a-vis list of domestic and International targets, technological capabilities and tooling, simultaneous remit as a hacker-for-hire, exploit vendor, and educational capabilities, while harboring internal employee discontent over low pay, which may indicate that the PRC did not see Anxun as a market player in regards to compensation.\n\nLeaked supporting documents reveal a complex ecosystem, not too dissimilar from Western counterparts, of smaller exploit vendors acquired by larger groups in bidding for government contracts, as well as subcontractors handling different aspects of offensive tooling on offer⁸². In summary, the distinctions drawn from the Anxun leaks raise two significant observations: first, not all mercenaries and exploit vendors may be seen as separate private actors; 'privateness' is relative to state coercive abilities and a company's product offering, and second, that the Chinese military-industrial complex as regards its offensive cyber ecosystem appears to be broader and with more blurred pub-\n\n⁷⁸ Brazil, M.

    "topology of these relationships describe a private actor's vulnerability to state coercion, and are structural indicators of private power.\n\nThe state must be capable of weaponizing a more favorable structural position to wield the appropriate strategy over a target private actor located in a competing state, and use it to implicitly target its strategic competitor. Effectiveness weaponization depends on the political and economic levers available to the state; these levers are originate from, and affect, economic and political information systems through, and in addition, to cyberspace. Uses of cross-domain levers on domestic or foreign private actors, distinct from the more direct strategy of cross-domain coercion in state-state relations, are nevertheless structural strategies and may be analyzed as state capabilities.\n\nIn particular, the state must command to its advantage three interdependent features in domestic political economy to leverage private actors in achieving its national objectives. First, political coupling. The more closely a private actor is coupled with the political objectives of the state in which it locates primary operations, the more it will be aligned to changes in the state's domestic and foreign policy. As the private actor develops a self-reinforcing trust relationship with the state (which may not be reciprocal) the actor may enjoy the state's protection and favor as it loses political independence. In authoritarian governments, such as with the Chinese state's role as 'king-maker', tight political coupling plays to the economic incentive of the private actor; it is especially in the interest of the mercenary to maintain trust with the state, despite staff-level discontent in the Anxun case.\n\nSecond, economic independence. When the private actor extracts a high or low economic value in a global supply chain based on market forces, the state's coercive capabilities on the actor are reduced up to a threshold, where high value businesses can counter with coercive strategies of their own, such as threats to leave a jurisdiction or domestic market. For example, consumer apps such as",
    "WhatsApp and Signal threatened to leave UK markets in response to drafts of the Online Safety Bill that propose state access message metadata, bypassing end-to-end encryption, and OpenAI and other tech startups’ resistance to safety provisions in the European AI act.\n\nHigh-value businesses have increased bargaining abilities which can overcome the state’s coercive strategies and impact national security. In democratic capitalist systems in particular, the state may interpret higher economic value in a private actor, such as a tech platform, as a proxy for societal trust, which it can instrument to foster political trust to achieve domestic objectives. In general, the state is better positioned to exercise cooperative strategies the more 'private' the actor becomes in such political economies, at the potential short-term trade off in public goods such as national security, to use the reputational or economic leverage gained in cyberspace. Low-value businesses look to forming economic interdependencies with higher value actors through interaction in the supply chain, in part to benefit from the free rider benefits that come with the high value actor’s bargaining power with the state.\n\nThird, legal and regulatory incentives. High-value businesses in market economies can coerce the state’s regulatory apparatus towards extreme situations such as regulatory capture; the resulting entrenched power allows the private actor to exercise 'state-like' strategies, as any attempt for the state to remove its own interdependencies may be too expensive. Political compliance thresholds imposed in authoritarian systems, on the other hand, allow the state to coerce even high-value businesses and their lower-value dependencies. China’s dynamic regulatory model can tighten or loosen regulatory controls quickly in the absence of dissent to its top-down hierarchies and severe domestic informa",
    "tion asymmetries, but pivoting comes at the cost of high volatility and disengagement of the private sector⁸⁵.\n\nDepending on the type of market failure correction, Western counterparts can instrument regulation that imposes a greater proportional cost on lower-value businesses to comply, but can generate the same public good in other jurisdictions because of interdependent information flows, such as data protection through the EU GDPR. Although the effect of the regulation, such as antitrust, reroutes the direction of information flows to limit the economic benefit to private actors from gatekeeping, the formulation of regulation is based on cooperative strategies in liberal democratic systems that trade-off slow reversal for greater stability between industry and state allies. In contrast, Zhang’s model uses Chinese tech regulation as an implicit trust process between state and industry, which industry uses to calibrate self-regulation in practice where state coercion is too expensive.\n\nIn summary, private actors, especially industry actors, must balance their structural vulnerabilities to state coercion with market competition; the imposed cost on the actor to remain competitive will also be passed to low and high value businesses in the supply chain. In May 2024, Huawei smartphones replaced Google’s Android operating system with a proprietary OS to evade US export controls, at significant cost to WeChat and other smaller app developers, who must rewrite apps to remain OS compatible⁸⁶. If the state’s coercive capabilities are too aggressive, it may still achieve its national security goals, but change trusted information flows within the private actor ecosystem that encourage competition by reducing the cost of innovation or integration. As private actors seek power parity with competitors, their reciprocal strategies towards foreign and home state capabilities\n\n⁸⁵ Zhang, A. H. (2024).

    "ties are guided by the same structural incentives as middle power states in state-state dynamics; strategic choice may allow rising private actors to use cooperative regulatory and economic state strategies while evading too-close political coupling.\n\nThe state actor, in its several roles vis-a-vis private actors, such as a regulator of private information flows in tech ecosystems, a buyer of offensive cyber capabilities, a partner on public-private defensive strategies, has limited coercive abilities on cyberspace directly as offensive cyber capabilities are not without technological interdependencies. Instead, the state uses political coupling, economic and legal incentives or punishments to shape political and economic information systems, for which cyberspace serves as the underlying communication channel by facilitating information flows. Policymakers must balance existing trust relations and interdependencies in all three information systems to select optimal strategies that reshape networks in cyberspace and meet their national objectives. China's statecraft towards regional powers is perceived as asymmetric by default[87]. The state adopts a mix of 'uniform' and 'selective' strategies towards its neighbors, based on structural factors such as relative power, existing 'alignment', or competitor status. In cyberspace, to continue asymmetric engagement with competing states, it must overcome a low-trust domestic environment of fluctuating coercion, high volatility and fragility to maintain or expand its whole-of-nation coercive leverage, otherwise risking fragmentation in business-state trust relations to create new national security vulnerabilities.\n\n# 5.

    "A political theory of cyber statecraft may be instructive in analyzing, predicting, or responding to adversarial behavior in cyberspace. An adversary's structural position in domestic and foreign ecosystems, using the tool of political economy, can form the basis for these dynamics. The use of political economy as an analytic tool for cyberspace behavior and governance is not new; a theory of 'structuration'88 argues that 'the real cyber war... is a competition between different political economies of the information society'. In this article a conceptual framework unites the power and interdependence through an explicit approach to trust within information systems such as cyberspace.\n\nThis article omits specific military aspects of cyber statecraft, in particular, the mobilization of state and private actor capabilities in the military domain and the application of trust relations. This is, in part, due to cultural complexities in a state's roles $^{8990}$ . Previously opaque structures within authoritarian governments are changing towards a separation of roles in cyber statecraft; even the Chinese state, which has traditionally seen information warfare as a homogenous offensive front through its Strategic Support Force, has now separated its military activities within the PLA through a new Information Support Force, in addition to state and provincial bodies $^{91}$ .

    "contexts played by a state across conflict domains may be useful for future work on theorizing the development and mobilization of a state's cyber power.\n\nWe conclude with three implications of our theory for cyber statecraft. Firstly, the role of entrenched trust relationships over time. One possible outcome of structural shifts in cyberspace is fragmentation, resulting from protectionist policies in Internet governance. The literature on fragmentation is vast[92], but state-private relations through this conceptual framework suggest a more subtle shift towards increasing volatility, where a gradual hardening of trust relations over time comes at the cost of forming new ones, leading to the formation of 'information enclaves' which deprioritize investment in security.\n\nHowever, policy responses such as increased emphasis on norm-contesting $^{93}$  in what has been characterized as an anarchical space $^{94}$ , may have deepened the emerging cyberspace phenomenon that prioritizes trust based on agents' identity, rather than information integrity. While national security strategies may incentivize states to contain information flows within their jurisdictions, in liberal democracies, volatility leads to a security paradox where increased information asymmetries lead to poorer defenses and security, as seen in military cyber incident response initiatives $^{95}$ .\n\n92 Mueller, M.

    "The paradox presents two corollaries regarding the impact of these structural changes to future trust relationships. Firstly, the strategic implications of agent-, not information-based trust on decision-making in middle powers and how they will choose to align themselves in future, as well as the future of trust in multilateral institutions. Secondly, that in a bid to reduce information asymmetries caused by volatility, covert activity in cyberspace, such as espionage, will further rise to compensate for the resulting leverage deficit. The US Cyber Command's strategy of 'persistent engagement' is a recent example. Some researchers have linked China's 2021 mandatory vulnerability disclosures with increased offensive cyber activity⁹⁶.\n\nRecent scholarship on national strategies for a fragmented cyberspace acknowledges the renewed need for building trust, through cooperative strategies of trade agreements, aid, coalitions and partnerships with aligned public and private players, and norm-building⁹⁷, while recognizing that the suggestion of former Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe, that 'trusted data flows' should be prioritized over spreading Western-style democracy, remains an effective guiding principle.\n\nSecondly, the ability for effective response to structural changes, desirable or otherwise.

Circumventing norms, political dissent, and civil society to reverse a regulatory regime that was reliant on Western capital, has come at the severe cost of high domestic political volatility¹⁰⁰.\n\nOn the other hand, coercive strategies in Western nation-states vary in their effectiveness based on political economic attitudes: the European Union’s approach to regulating the tech sector for anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior through the Digital Markets Act, for example, continues a tradition of policymaking rooted in social welfare, contrasted with the American perspective of a market-based approach. One potential trade-off of slower mobilization of domestic private-partner relationships is the increased independence of industry to innovate, diversify its supply chains, and contribute to structural changes in a more stable manner.\n\nThirdly, the stability of coalitions based on a vaguely-defined ‘common interest’ versus trust-based relations, which may be long-term and strategic, or short-term and tactical in nature. The degree of interdependence within coalitions of competitors in different sectors that show adversarial behavior to so-called Western interests in cyberspace, such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea is a salient example.

This may, in part, be due to a growing consensus that 'the attribution problem' of who to blame for cyberattacks, and how to punish them, is no longer a useful deterrent in cyberspace.\n\nSimply challenging hegemonic power does not mean that self-interest is aligned with common interest. While defense commentators in the West perceive of this coalition of non-liberal democratic or authoritarian governments as a new 'axis', it has coercive dynamics of its own. Each player has associated structural strengths and weaknesses, and relative power. China's 'all-of-nation' approach to offensive cyber activity and domestic structures are in stark contrast with Iran's cyberspace posture, or North Korea's extortion-based attacks to support its political economy. The national objectives these adversaries seek to fulfill, manifested through destabilizing actions in cyberspace, seemingly intend to produce sectorial outcomes. Simple belligerence towards various aspects of Western polities and economies may not form the basis for sustainable trust relations.\n\nDyadic relations, in addition to group relations, may be another useful indicator.
