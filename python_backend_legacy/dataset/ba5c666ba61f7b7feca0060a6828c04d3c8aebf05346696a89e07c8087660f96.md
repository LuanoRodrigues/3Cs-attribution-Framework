The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. The article opens with a discussion of the application of the traditional principles of sovereignty to activities in cyberspace and subsequently analyses how the principles of countermeasures may be applied to various forms of harmful cyber-incidents that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence. The article also examines the extent to which a plea of necessity may be invoked in order to justify the use of immediate defensive measures against cyber-attacks that may have an effect on other states.\n## Keywords\nlow level cyber-attack – sovereignty – due diligence – attribution – non-intervention – countermeasures – necessity\n* The author would like to thank Katrine Vedel Thisted for excellent student assistance.\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2015 | DOI 10.1163/15718107-08402008\nHENRIKSEN\n# 1 Introduction\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed that it had been the target of a cyber-attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data, such as unreleased movies. A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un.¹ Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack² and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry.³ North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.⁴\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns⁵\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’.⁶ Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks.

And while we have witnessed instances of extensive cyber campaigns conducted both during conventional military operations[11] and in the immediate period leading up to a conventional military attack,[12] we have yet to see the first cyberwar conducted entirely in cyberspace. Indeed, the notorious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007[13] that accelerated much of the scholarly interest in identifying the legal framework governing computer network operations neither reached the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence[14] nor initiated an armed conflict in cyberspace. In his response to the hacking of Sony, U.S. President Barack Obama was also careful to distance himself from any notion that the hacking was somehow tantamount to an 'act of war' and instead opted to use the term 'cyber-vandalism'.[15] For the time being, then, the most pressing legal issues for those states, such as the Nordic countries, that are in the process of establishing national guidelines for countering harmful interferences in cyberspace relate not to responding to 'armed attacks' or to the proper conduct of a cyberwar as such, but rather to identifying the proper legal framework for responding to those harmful cyber-incidents that, though still a cause of concern and widespread disturbance, are of a much less serious character.[16]\n11 One example would be the Russian cyber operations conducted during the 2008 international armed conflict with Georgia, see E.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

The article ends with a brief conclusion (section five). Before proceeding, however, some clarification is needed about the basic tenets of cyberspace and the various forms harmful cyber-interferences may take.\nIn contrast to the four physical domains (land, water, air and space), cyberspace is an entirely man-maid arena where humans and machines communicate and interact. In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'.[17] Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\".[18] While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users.[19] It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".[20]\n17 See e.g., M.

In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one.²¹ Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence.²² The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel²³ and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project²⁴ belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n²¹ Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n²² Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n²³ M.

It may also be to inflict civilian or military losses on another state by derailing trains, polluting drinking water or disrupting electricity supply. In such cases, the civilian infrastructure is 'weaponised' in the sense that it is not the 'cyber weapon' as such (the software code) that inflicts the injury or causes a kinetic effect, but rather the physical structure that is controlled by the computer or network under attack.26 A particular type of cyber-attacks consists of computer-enabled efforts to seize control of the opponent's weapons systems.27 In practice, of course, as the hacking of Sony illustrates, it may be very difficult to determine how one should classify a particular cyber-incident according to the three categories just listed and there is no doubt that some interferences in cyber-space may incorporate elements of two or even all three of the categories.\n## 2 Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIn the early to mid-1990s, cyberspace was often referred to as a new sort of domain – sui generis – that was somehow meant to be outside the reach of individual states. In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards. Indeed, cyberspace never became self-regulated, it never became borderless and states never became\n25 U.S. Department of Defense, United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations, November 2006, <www.dod.mil joint_staff=\"\" pubs=\"\" joint_staff_jointoperations=\"\" 07-f-2105doc1.pdf=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.

On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.²⁹\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”.³⁰ In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”³¹ With a few exceptions,³² then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein.³³ To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n34 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 126.

Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation,⁴² it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm.⁴³ It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct.⁴⁴ Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\".⁴⁵ To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\".⁴⁶ The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n⁴² See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n⁴³ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n⁴⁴ See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

These are cases of constructive knowledge where the state 'should have known' about cyber-attacks emanating from its territory.47 Consequently, it is unsettled if a territorial state violates its obligation to protect other states from harmful acts \"if it fails to use due care in policing cyber activities ... and is therefore unaware of the acts in question\".48 As Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg has noted, however, it may not make much of a practical difference if a standard of constructive knowledge is established or not. The technological configurations of cyberspace make it \"difficult, if not impossible\" to fulfil wide-ranging obligations to prevent potentially harmful activities from occurring.49 The authors of the manual could also not agree if the territorial state is obliged to stop cyber-attacks against other states that are merely routed through its infrastructure.50 Also in this regard, however, the technological issues involved may render an obligation meaningless because the \"data in question could simply be rerouted and then still reach the destination in the target State\".51\nPractical difficulties aside, the fundamental legal principle is clear: If a territorial state does not live up to its responsibility to protect other states from harmful cyber-attacks that emanate from its territory, it is breaching its international due diligence obligations towards the victim state. As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed\n47 Ibid., rule 5(11).\n48 Ibid. Clearly, this is an area in which there are inherent trade-offs between liberty and security at stake. Although there is little doubt that overall security would be enhanced if states were better at patrolling the cyber-activities that occur within their territories, there is also a limit as to how much governmental oversight that is desired. The more territorial states are required to protect other states from harmful activities, the more incentive the law creates for surveillance and other forms of interferences with the very freedoms that have always made cyberspace such a cherished space.\n49 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 137.\n50 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 5(12).\n51 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 138.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nattacks' in cyberspace. Hence, the analysis will not discuss the parameters of the application of the right to self-defence to cyber-attacks.\n## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n### 3.1 Introduction\nInternational law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law⁵² and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility.⁵³ According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\".⁵⁴ As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\"⁵⁵ Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state.⁵⁶ Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors.⁵⁷ Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations⁵⁸ and the measure\n⁵² Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

Furthermore, measures that are exerted as a means of revenge are unlawful. According to the ILC, countermeasures must be \"taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question\".59 Countermeasures must be reversible60 and the measures must be lifted as soon as the internationally wrongful act ceases.61\n## 3.2 A Breach of an International Obligation in Cyberspace\nAs mentioned above, a state can employ countermeasures against a state that breaches its obligations towards that state. This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n59 Ibid., Art. 49(3).

But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately.⁶⁵ While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law.⁶⁶ The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities,⁶⁷ the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law.⁶⁸ Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\"⁶⁹ does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.⁷⁰\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n⁶⁵ For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A.

The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question.⁸² As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n⁸⁰ Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n⁸¹ For more, see the reference in note 13.\n⁸² The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n341\nbehind false IP addresses, foreign servers and aliases, attackers can act with almost complete anonymity and relative impunity\".83 There is, in short, a well-known attribution problem in cyberspace.84 While this problem is most acute with regard to the use of measures of self-defence,85 it also limits the use of countermeasures. Two considerations are worth stressing, however.\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n83 Cornish et al., supra note 7, p. 13.\n84 In practical terms, the lack of knowledge of the identity of the aggressor will also make it difficult for the victim state to judge the motive and/or purpose of the activities in question, which in turn makes it hard for the state to determine the proper response. As Susan W. Brenner has noted, our domestic procedures for responding to harmful conduct depend on basic assumptions about the purpose of the conduct in question. See Brenner, supra note 16, pp. 379–475: See also D.B. Hollis, ‘An e-sos for Cyberspace’, 52:2 Harvard International Law Journal (2011) pp. 374–432 and J.

If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.⁸⁸\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁸⁹ Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.⁹⁰\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist.⁹¹ The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter.⁹² The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck.⁹³ The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n⁸⁸ D.E.

In practical terms, of course, both quantitative and qualitative elements may be of relevance.98\nIf a countermeasure is of such gravity that it appears to fail the proportionality test, it may be interpreted as revenge or punishment on the targeted state and therefore fall outside the boundaries of lawful countermeasures.99 It is important to note, however, that countermeasures need not be reciprocal in nature and that, in theory, nothing prevents a state from responding to a cyberattack by employing other than cyber-means. Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n94 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9(7).\n95 See Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 85.\n96 White and Abass, supra note 54, pp. 539–540.\n97 A.

It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.¹⁰³ In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention,¹⁰⁴ the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures,¹⁰⁵ but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”.¹⁰⁶ To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁷ In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n¹⁰³ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n¹⁰⁴ For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n¹⁰⁵ A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

When the UN Charter was drafted, a Brazilian proposal to extend the reach of the prohibition on the use of force to economic sanctions did not find support, see United Nations, Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, Vol. VI, pp. 720–721. In addition, both the 1970 UNGA Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations, supra note 71, and the 1987 UNGA Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations (A/RES/42/22) strongly indicate that Article 2(4) only covers the use of armed force.\n¹⁰⁶ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 39.\n¹⁰⁷ Roscini, supra note 7, p. 106.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n345\nin their defence departments and debate the threat from cyber ‘warfare’ also strongly indicates that cyber-related capabilities, such as viruses etc., can be regarded as a form of weapon, and by extension, also some sort of armed force for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁸ Moreover, a number of states have stated that they consider cyber-attacks as a form of force to which they reserve the right to respond.¹⁰⁹ While doubt certainly remains,¹¹⁰ at present the prevailing opinion appears to be that computer network operations may constitute force under Article 2(4), if the effects of the attack resemble a conventional military attack or kinetic force.¹¹¹\nThe Tallinn Manual lists eight factors that are meant to assist in identifying when cyber-attacks will be characterised as a use of force covered by Article 2(4). The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N. Schmitt,¹¹² are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.¹¹³ As the Manual states, however, the factors listed are not meant to be exhaustive and, depending on the circumstances, a state may look to other factors, such as the prevailing political environment, the identity of the attacker and the nature of the target in order to determine if the cyber-activities in question constitute use of force for the purposes of article 2(4).¹¹⁴ In sum, then, it seems clear that a case-by-case evaluation is called for.\nSecondly, since offensive countermeasures in cyberspace could potentially infringe on rights associated with the free and unhindered flow of information in the target state, such as a right to privacy and the free flow of information, it is also important to note that under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures may not be aimed at “obligations for the protection of fundamental\n¹⁰⁸ Ibid., p. 107.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid., pp. 108–109.\n¹¹⁰ See also, Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA Nominee for Commander, United States Cyber Command, <www.washingtonpost.com documents=\"\" questions.pdf=\"\" wp-srv=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.\n¹¹¹ See also U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace - Remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, 18 September 2012, <www.state.gov l1=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" releases=\"\" s=\"\" www.state.gov=\"\">, visited on 20 January 2014; Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 103; Barkham, supra note 7, p. 72; Lin, supra note 7, p. 73; Gill and Ducheine, supra note 7, p. 439; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 104–107; J.J.C.H.

It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state.[117] In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups.[118] These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\",[119] or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\".[120] In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace.

Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”,¹²³ it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states.¹²⁴ Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.¹²⁵\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.¹²⁶\n¹²¹ See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n¹²² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n¹²³ ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n¹²⁴ Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n¹²⁵ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n¹²⁶ See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>\nHENRIKSEN\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations.¹²⁷ State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate.¹²⁸ In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\".¹²⁹ In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\".¹³⁰ Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".¹³¹\n## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace\nAs the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for\n¹²⁷ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a.

In the most dire of circumstances, a plea of necessity may provide such an authority and necessity must therefore also be considered a potentially important supplement to countermeasures for those states that may need to respond to immediate and harmful cyber-activity.\nAs a concept under international law, reflected in Article 25 of the ILC's 2001 draft articles on state responsibility,¹³² necessity is a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act that otherwise breaches international law, and it relates to those rare cases where the only way for a state to safeguard an \"essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency\".¹³³ At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\".¹³⁴ For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\".¹³⁵ The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".¹³⁶\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances¹³⁷ and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n¹³² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n¹³³ Ibid.

If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.¹⁴⁵\n# 5 Conclusion\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve.¹⁴⁶ Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n¹⁴⁶ See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351",

The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. The article opens with a discussion of the application of the traditional principles of sovereignty to activities in cyberspace and subsequently analyses how the principles of countermeasures may be applied to various forms of harmful cyber-incidents that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence. The article also examines the extent to which a plea of necessity may be invoked in order to justify the use of immediate defensive measures against cyber-attacks that may have an effect on other states.\n## Keywords\nlow level cyber-attack – sovereignty – due diligence – attribution – non-intervention – countermeasures – necessity\n* The author would like to thank Katrine Vedel Thisted for excellent student assistance.\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2015 | DOI 10.1163/15718107-08402008\nHENRIKSEN\n# 1 Introduction\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed that it had been the target of a cyber-attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data, such as unreleased movies. A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un. Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry. North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’. Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'.[17] Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\".[18] While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users.[19] It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".[20]\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.dcaf.ch></www.rand.org></www.economist.com>\nHENRIKSEN\nAs mentioned above, this article explores immediate and lawful responses to harmful interferences in cyberspace. In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one. Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence. The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n M.

In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards. Indeed, cyberspace never became self-regulated, it never became borderless and states never became\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</projects.eff.org></csis.org></www.dod.mil>\nHENRIKSEN\nabsent. On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”. In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.” With a few exceptions, then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein. To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.icj-cij.org></www>\nHENRIKSEN\nThe obligation is hard to apply in real life, however. Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation, it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm. It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct. Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\". To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\". The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nattacks' in cyberspace. Hence, the analysis will not discuss the parameters of the application of the right to self-defence to cyber-attacks.\n## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n### 3.1 Introduction\nInternational law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility. According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\". As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\" Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state. Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors. Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations and the measure\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nanother state will only constitute a violation of sovereignty if it causes a certain level of damage. Cyber-activities that only inflict very limited damage or that are merely routed through the infrastructure of the state would not violate international law. But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately. While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law. The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities, the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law. Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\" does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A.

The well-known 2007 cyber-attacks on Estonia may serve as a case in point. The attacks occurred in the aftermath of an Estonia decision to relocate a Russian war memorial from the centre of the capital, Tallinn, to a military cemetery outside the city. The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question. As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n For more, see the reference in note 13.\n The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.cfr.org></www.thei3p.org>\nHENRIKSEN\nthe perpetrators of at least some harmful cyber-incidents. If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt. Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist. The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter. The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck. The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n D.E. Sanger and M. Facklerjan, 'N.S.A.

Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.fas.org>\nHENRIKSEN\nCaution is needed, however, as such offensive measures may easily end up conflicting with the parameters of lawful countermeasures. It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”. In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention, the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures, but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”. To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4). In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

Waxman, supra note 104, p. 427; Lin, supra note 7, pp. 71–72 and 80; Silver, supra note 7, p. 81. When the UN Charter was drafted, a Brazilian proposal to extend the reach of the prohibition on the use of force to economic sanctions did not find support, see United Nations, Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, Vol. VI, pp. 720–721. In addition, both the 1970 UNGA Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations, supra note 71, and the 1987 UNGA Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations (A/RES/42/22) strongly indicate that Article 2(4) only covers the use of armed force.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 39.\n Roscini, supra note 7, p. 106.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe Tallinn Manual lists eight factors that are meant to assist in identifying when cyber-attacks will be characterised as a use of force covered by Article 2(4). The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N. Schmitt, are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality. As the Manual states, however, the factors listed are not meant to be exhaustive and, depending on the circumstances, a state may look to other factors, such as the prevailing political environment, the identity of the attacker and the nature of the target in order to determine if the cyber-activities in question constitute use of force for the purposes of article 2(4). In sum, then, it seems clear that a case-by-case evaluation is called for.\nSecondly, since offensive countermeasures in cyberspace could potentially infringe on rights associated with the free and unhindered flow of information in the target state, such as a right to privacy and the free flow of information, it is also important to note that under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures may not be aimed at “obligations for the protection of fundamental\n Ibid., p. 107.\n Ibid., pp. 108–109.\n See also, Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA Nominee for Commander, United States Cyber Command, <www.washingtonpost.com documents=\"\" questions.pdf=\"\" wp-srv=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.\n See also U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace - Remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, 18 September 2012, <www.state.gov l1=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" releases=\"\" s=\"\" www.state.gov=\"\">, visited on 20 January 2014; Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 103; Barkham, supra note 7, p. 72; Lin, supra note 7, p. 73; Gill and Ducheine, supra note 7, p. 439; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 104–107; J.J.C.H.

It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state.[117] In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups.[118] These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\",[119] or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\".[120] In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org>\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nAn additional potential problem associated with resorting to offensive countermeasures in cyberspace relates to the fact that it may be difficult to limit the effects of a countermeasure to the targeted state and not unintentionally harm uninvolved third states. Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”, it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states. Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.\n See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>\nHENRIKSEN\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations. State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate. In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\". In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\". Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".\n## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace\nAs the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a. See also Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 84.\n ILC, ibid., Art. 52(1)b.\n Ibid., Art. 52(2). See also Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9(4).\n K.C. Hinkle, 'Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry About', 37 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 18.\n Ibid.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nAs a concept under international law, reflected in Article 25 of the ILC's 2001 draft articles on state responsibility, necessity is a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act that otherwise breaches international law, and it relates to those rare cases where the only way for a state to safeguard an \"essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency\". At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\". For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\". The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n Ibid. See also Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 51.\n Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9 (12).\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 51–52.

France) 30 April 1990, Arbitral Tribunal, Award, para. 78.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nwhether the conditions for pleading necessity have been met. As mentioned above, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake and international law also requires that the international obligation that is not fulfilled must be of a lesser weight. Thus, trivial cyber-disturbances cannot justify a plea of necessity. In addition, when invoking necessity, a state may not “seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole”. In practice, this would seem to exclude the resort to forcible measures. Furthermore, necessity cannot be invoked if the “international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity”, or the “[s]tate has contributed to the situation of necessity”. Article 25 must also be read in conjunction with Article 26 of the draft articles according to which necessity cannot preclude “the wrongfulness of any act of a State which is not in conformity with an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law”. Finally, in order to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measures chosen must be the only ones available. If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.\n# 5 Conclusion\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain. As the states become more vocal – and certain – about how they can interpret the relevant parts of international law and international and national courts decide concrete cases involving computer\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, ibid., para. 51.\n See also ILC’s commentary to Article 25, ILC, supra note 121, p. 80 et seq., <http: incl=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" yearbooks=\"\">/ILC_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf/, visited on 7 February 2015.\n Ibid.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve. Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351",

A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un.¹ Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack² and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry.³ North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.⁴\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns⁵\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

And while we have witnessed instances of extensive cyber campaigns conducted both during conventional military operations and in the immediate period leading up to a conventional military attack, we have yet to see the first cyberwar conducted entirely in cyberspace. Indeed, the notorious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 that accelerated much of the scholarly interest in identifying the legal framework governing computer network operations neither reached the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence nor initiated an armed conflict in cyberspace. In his response to the hacking of Sony, U.S. President Barack Obama was also careful to distance himself from any notion that the hacking was somehow tantamount to an 'act of war' and instead opted to use the term 'cyber-vandalism'. For the time being, then, the most pressing legal issues for those states, such as the Nordic countries, that are in the process of establishing national guidelines for countering harmful interferences in cyberspace relate not to responding to 'armed attacks' or to the proper conduct of a cyberwar as such, but rather to identifying the proper legal framework for responding to those harmful cyber-incidents that, though still a cause of concern and widespread disturbance, are of a much less serious character.\n11 One example would be the Russian cyber operations conducted during the 2008 international armed conflict with Georgia, see E.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

The article ends with a brief conclusion (section five). Before proceeding, however, some clarification is needed about the basic tenets of cyberspace and the various forms harmful cyber-interferences may take.\nIn contrast to the four physical domains (land, water, air and space), cyberspace is an entirely man-maid arena where humans and machines communicate and interact. In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'. Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\". While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users. It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".\n17 See e.g., M.

In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one.²¹ Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence.²² The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel²³ and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project²⁴ belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n²¹ Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n²² Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n²³ M.

It may also be to inflict civilian or military losses on another state by derailing trains, polluting drinking water or disrupting electricity supply. In such cases, the civilian infrastructure is 'weaponised' in the sense that it is not the 'cyber weapon' as such (the software code) that inflicts the injury or causes a kinetic effect, but rather the physical structure that is controlled by the computer or network under attack.26 A particular type of cyber-attacks consists of computer-enabled efforts to seize control of the opponent's weapons systems.27 In practice, of course, as the hacking of Sony illustrates, it may be very difficult to determine how one should classify a particular cyber-incident according to the three categories just listed and there is no doubt that some interferences in cyber-space may incorporate elements of two or even all three of the categories.",
    "## 2 Sovereignty in Cyberspace": "In the early to mid-1990s, cyberspace was often referred to as a new sort of domain – sui generis – that was somehow meant to be outside the reach of individual states. In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards. Indeed, cyberspace never became self-regulated, it never became borderless and states never became\n25 U.S. Department of Defense, United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations, November 2006, <www.dod.mil joint_staff=\"\" pubs=\"\" joint_staff_jointoperations=\"\" 07-f-2105doc1.pdf=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.

On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.²⁹\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”.³⁰ In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”³¹ With a few exceptions,³² then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein.³³ To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n34 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 126.

Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation,⁴² it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm.⁴³ It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct.⁴⁴ Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\".⁴⁵ To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\".⁴⁶ The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n⁴² See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n⁴³ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n⁴⁴ See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

These are cases of constructive knowledge where the state 'should have known' about cyber-attacks emanating from its territory.47 Consequently, it is unsettled if a territorial state violates its obligation to protect other states from harmful acts \"if it fails to use due care in policing cyber activities ... and is therefore unaware of the acts in question\".48 As Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg has noted, however, it may not make much of a practical difference if a standard of constructive knowledge is established or not. The technological configurations of cyberspace make it \"difficult, if not impossible\" to fulfil wide-ranging obligations to prevent potentially harmful activities from occurring.49 The authors of the manual could also not agree if the territorial state is obliged to stop cyber-attacks against other states that are merely routed through its infrastructure.50 Also in this regard, however, the technological issues involved may render an obligation meaningless because the \"data in question could simply be rerouted and then still reach the destination in the target State\".51\nPractical difficulties aside, the fundamental legal principle is clear: If a territorial state does not live up to its responsibility to protect other states from harmful cyber-attacks that emanate from its territory, it is breaching its international due diligence obligations towards the victim state. As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed\n47 Ibid., rule 5(11).\n48 Ibid. Clearly, this is an area in which there are inherent trade-offs between liberty and security at stake. Although there is little doubt that overall security would be enhanced if states were better at patrolling the cyber-activities that occur within their territories, there is also a limit as to how much governmental oversight that is desired. The more territorial states are required to protect other states from harmful activities, the more incentive the law creates for surveillance and other forms of interferences with the very freedoms that have always made cyberspace such a cherished space.\n49 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 137.\n50 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 5(12).\n51 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 138.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nattacks' in cyberspace.

    "## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace": "### 3.1 Introduction\nInternational law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law⁵² and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility.⁵³ According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\".⁵⁴ As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\"⁵⁵ Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state.⁵⁶ Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors.⁵⁷ Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations⁵⁸ and the measure\n⁵² Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

Furthermore, measures that are exerted as a means of revenge are unlawful. According to the ILC, countermeasures must be \"taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question\".59 Countermeasures must be reversible60 and the measures must be lifted as soon as the internationally wrongful act ceases.61\n## 3.2 A Breach of an International Obligation in Cyberspace\nAs mentioned above, a state can employ countermeasures against a state that breaches its obligations towards that state. This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n59 Ibid., Art. 49(3).

But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately.⁶⁵ While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law.⁶⁶ The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities,⁶⁷ the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law.⁶⁸ Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\"⁶⁹ does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.⁷⁰\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n⁶⁵ For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A.

The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question.⁸² As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n⁸⁰ Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n⁸¹ For more, see the reference in note 13.\n⁸² The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n341\nbehind false IP addresses, foreign servers and aliases, attackers can act with almost complete anonymity and relative impunity\".83 There is, in short, a well-known attribution problem in cyberspace.84 While this problem is most acute with regard to the use of measures of self-defence,85 it also limits the use of countermeasures. Two considerations are worth stressing, however.\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n83 Cornish et al., supra note 7, p. 13.\n84 In practical terms, the lack of knowledge of the identity of the aggressor will also make it difficult for the victim state to judge the motive and/or purpose of the activities in question, which in turn makes it hard for the state to determine the proper response. As Susan W. Brenner has noted, our domestic procedures for responding to harmful conduct depend on basic assumptions about the purpose of the conduct in question. See Brenner, supra note 16, pp. 379–475: See also D.B. Hollis, ‘An e-sos for Cyberspace’, 52:2 Harvard International Law Journal (2011) pp. 374–432 and J.

If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.⁸⁸\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁸⁹ Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.⁹⁰\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist.⁹¹ The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter.⁹² The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck.⁹³ The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n⁸⁸ D.E.

In practical terms, of course, both quantitative and qualitative elements may be of relevance.98\nIf a countermeasure is of such gravity that it appears to fail the proportionality test, it may be interpreted as revenge or punishment on the targeted state and therefore fall outside the boundaries of lawful countermeasures.99 It is important to note, however, that countermeasures need not be reciprocal in nature and that, in theory, nothing prevents a state from responding to a cyberattack by employing other than cyber-means. Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n94 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9(7).\n95 See Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 85.\n96 White and Abass, supra note 54, pp. 539–540.\n97 A.

It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.¹⁰³ In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention,¹⁰⁴ the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures,¹⁰⁵ but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”.¹⁰⁶ To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁷ In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n¹⁰³ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n¹⁰⁴ For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n¹⁰⁵ A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

Waxman, supra note 104, p. 427; Lin, supra note 7, pp. 71–72 and 80; Silver, supra note 7, p. 81. When the UN Charter was drafted, a Brazilian proposal to extend the reach of the prohibition on the use of force to economic sanctions did not find support, see United Nations, Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, Vol. VI, pp. 720–721. In addition, both the 1970 UNGA Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations, supra note 71, and the 1987 UNGA Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations (A/RES/42/22) strongly indicate that Article 2(4) only covers the use of armed force.\n¹⁰⁶ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 39.\n¹⁰⁷ Roscini, supra note 7, p. 106.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n345\nin their defence departments and debate the threat from cyber ‘warfare’ also strongly indicates that cyber-related capabilities, such as viruses etc., can be regarded as a form of weapon, and by extension, also some sort of armed force for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁸ Moreover, a number of states have stated that they consider cyber-attacks as a form of force to which they reserve the right to respond.¹⁰⁹ While doubt certainly remains,¹¹⁰ at present the prevailing opinion appears to be that computer network operations may constitute force under Article 2(4), if the effects of the attack resemble a conventional military attack or kinetic force.¹¹¹\nThe Tallinn Manual lists eight factors that are meant to assist in identifying when cyber-attacks will be characterised as a use of force covered by Article 2(4). The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N. Schmitt,¹¹² are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.¹¹³ As the Manual states, however, the factors listed are not meant to be exhaustive and, depending on the circumstances, a state may look to other factors, such as the prevailing political environment, the identity of the attacker and the nature of the target in order to determine if the cyber-activities in question constitute use of force for the purposes of article 2(4).¹¹⁴ In sum, then, it seems clear that a case-by-case evaluation is called for.\nSecondly, since offensive countermeasures in cyberspace could potentially infringe on rights associated with the free and unhindered flow of information in the target state, such as a right to privacy and the free flow of information, it is also important to note that under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures may not be aimed at “obligations for the protection of fundamental\n¹⁰⁸ Ibid., p. 107.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid., pp. 108–109.\n¹¹⁰ See also, Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA Nominee for Commander, United States Cyber Command, <www.washingtonpost.com documents=\"\" questions.pdf=\"\" wp-srv=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.\n¹¹¹ See also U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace - Remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, 18 September 2012, <www.state.gov l1=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" releases=\"\" s=\"\" www.state.gov=\"\">, visited on 20 January 2014; Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 103; Barkham, supra note 7, p. 72; Lin, supra note 7, p. 73; Gill and Ducheine, supra note 7, p. 439; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 104–107; J.J.C.H.

Although the commentary to the guidelines is silent with regard to what human rights it considers as 'fundamental,' it does refer to the fact that relevant human rights treaties list a number of human rights that may not be derogated from even in times of war or other public emergency. Privacy rights are not listed among such 'non-derogable' rights and this obviously indicates that countermeasures in cyberspace will usually not violate the ban on infringements of 'fundamental' rights. It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state. In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups. These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\", or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\". In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are\n115 ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)b.\n116 See the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, Art. 4; Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on Human rights, as amended) (ECHR) Art. 27.\n117 UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 8: The Relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights (E/C.12/1997/8) para. 4, <www.refworld.org 47a7079eo.html=\"\" docid=\"\" www.refworld.org=\"\">, visited 8 November 2014.\n118 Ibid, para. 14.\n119 ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)c.\n120 Ibid., Art. 50(1)d.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org>\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n347\nnot of a peremptory nature.¹²¹ On an additional – and fourth – note, according to the ILC, the right to resort to countermeasures does not relieve a state from fulfilling its obligations under a relevant “dispute settlement” or “to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives and documents”.¹²²\nAn additional potential problem associated with resorting to offensive countermeasures in cyberspace relates to the fact that it may be difficult to limit the effects of a countermeasure to the targeted state and not unintentionally harm uninvolved third states. Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”,¹²³ it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states.¹²⁴ Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.¹²⁵\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.¹²⁶\n¹²¹ See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n¹²² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n¹²³ ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n¹²⁴ Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n¹²⁵ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n¹²⁶ See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>\nHENRIKSEN\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations.¹²⁷ State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate.¹²⁸ In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\".¹²⁹ In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\".¹³⁰ Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".¹³¹",

In the most dire of circumstances, a plea of necessity may provide such an authority and necessity must therefore also be considered a potentially important supplement to countermeasures for those states that may need to respond to immediate and harmful cyber-activity.\nAs a concept under international law, reflected in Article 25 of the ILC's 2001 draft articles on state responsibility,¹³² necessity is a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act that otherwise breaches international law, and it relates to those rare cases where the only way for a state to safeguard an \"essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency\".¹³³ At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\".¹³⁴ For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\".¹³⁵ The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".¹³⁶\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances¹³⁷ and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n¹³² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n¹³³ Ibid.

If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.¹⁴⁵",
    "# 5 Conclusion": "A state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve.¹⁴⁶ Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n¹⁴⁶ See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351"

The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. The article opens with a discussion of the application of the traditional principles of sovereignty to activities in cyberspace and subsequently analyses how the principles of countermeasures may be applied to various forms of harmful cyber-incidents that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence. The article also examines the extent to which a plea of necessity may be invoked in order to justify the use of immediate defensive measures against cyber-attacks that may have an effect on other states.\n## Keywords\nlow level cyber-attack – sovereignty – due diligence – attribution – non-intervention – countermeasures – necessity\n* The author would like to thank Katrine Vedel Thisted for excellent student assistance.\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2015 | DOI 10.1163/15718107-08402008\nHENRIKSEN\n# 1 Introduction\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed that it had been the target of a cyber-attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data, such as unreleased movies. A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un. Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry. North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’. Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'.[17] Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\".[18] While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users.[19] It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".[20]\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.dcaf.ch></www.rand.org></www.economist.com>\nHENRIKSEN\nAs mentioned above, this article explores immediate and lawful responses to harmful interferences in cyberspace. In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one. Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence. The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n M.

In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards. Indeed, cyberspace never became self-regulated, it never became borderless and states never became\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</projects.eff.org></csis.org></www.dod.mil>\nHENRIKSEN\nabsent. On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”. In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.” With a few exceptions, then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein. To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.icj-cij.org></www>\nHENRIKSEN\nThe obligation is hard to apply in real life, however. Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation, it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm. It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct. Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\". To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\". The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nattacks' in cyberspace. Hence, the analysis will not discuss the parameters of the application of the right to self-defence to cyber-attacks.\n## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n### 3.1 Introduction\nInternational law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility. According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\". As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\" Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state. Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors. Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations and the measure\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nanother state will only constitute a violation of sovereignty if it causes a certain level of damage. Cyber-activities that only inflict very limited damage or that are merely routed through the infrastructure of the state would not violate international law. But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately. While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law. The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities, the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law. Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\" does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A.

The well-known 2007 cyber-attacks on Estonia may serve as a case in point. The attacks occurred in the aftermath of an Estonia decision to relocate a Russian war memorial from the centre of the capital, Tallinn, to a military cemetery outside the city. The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question. As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n For more, see the reference in note 13.\n The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.cfr.org></www.thei3p.org>\nHENRIKSEN\nthe perpetrators of at least some harmful cyber-incidents. If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt. Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist. The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter. The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck. The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n D.E. Sanger and M. Facklerjan, 'N.S.A.

Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.fas.org>\nHENRIKSEN\nCaution is needed, however, as such offensive measures may easily end up conflicting with the parameters of lawful countermeasures. It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”. In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention, the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures, but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”. To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4). In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

When the UN Charter was drafted, a Brazilian proposal to extend the reach of the prohibition on the use of force to economic sanctions did not find support, see United Nations, Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, Vol. VI, pp. 720–721. In addition, both the 1970 UNGA Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations, supra note 71, and the 1987 UNGA Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations (A/RES/42/22) strongly indicate that Article 2(4) only covers the use of armed force.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 39.\n Roscini, supra note 7, p. 106.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe Tallinn Manual lists eight factors that are meant to assist in identifying when cyber-attacks will be characterised as a use of force covered by Article 2(4). The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N. Schmitt, are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality. As the Manual states, however, the factors listed are not meant to be exhaustive and, depending on the circumstances, a state may look to other factors, such as the prevailing political environment, the identity of the attacker and the nature of the target in order to determine if the cyber-activities in question constitute use of force for the purposes of article 2(4). In sum, then, it seems clear that a case-by-case evaluation is called for.\nSecondly, since offensive countermeasures in cyberspace could potentially infringe on rights associated with the free and unhindered flow of information in the target state, such as a right to privacy and the free flow of information, it is also important to note that under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures may not be aimed at “obligations for the protection of fundamental\n Ibid., p. 107.\n Ibid., pp. 108–109.\n See also, Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA Nominee for Commander, United States Cyber Command, <www.washingtonpost.com documents=\"\" questions.pdf=\"\" wp-srv=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.\n See also U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace - Remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, 18 September 2012, <www.state.gov l1=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" releases=\"\" s=\"\" www.state.gov=\"\">, visited on 20 January 2014; Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 103; Barkham, supra note 7, p. 72; Lin, supra note 7, p. 73; Gill and Ducheine, supra note 7, p. 439; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 104–107; J.J.C.H.

It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state.[117] In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups.[118] These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\",[119] or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\".[120] In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org>\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nAn additional potential problem associated with resorting to offensive countermeasures in cyberspace relates to the fact that it may be difficult to limit the effects of a countermeasure to the targeted state and not unintentionally harm uninvolved third states. Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”, it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states. Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.\n See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>\nHENRIKSEN\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations. State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate. In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\". In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\". Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".\n## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace\nAs the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a. See also Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 84.\n ILC, ibid., Art. 52(1)b.\n Ibid., Art. 52(2). See also Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9(4).\n K.C. Hinkle, 'Countermeasures in the Cyber Context: One More Thing to Worry About', 37 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 18.\n Ibid.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nAs a concept under international law, reflected in Article 25 of the ILC's 2001 draft articles on state responsibility, necessity is a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act that otherwise breaches international law, and it relates to those rare cases where the only way for a state to safeguard an \"essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency\". At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\". For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\". The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n Ibid. See also Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 51.\n Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9 (12).\n Ibid.\n Ibid.\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 51–52.

France) 30 April 1990, Arbitral Tribunal, Award, para. 78.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nwhether the conditions for pleading necessity have been met. As mentioned above, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake and international law also requires that the international obligation that is not fulfilled must be of a lesser weight. Thus, trivial cyber-disturbances cannot justify a plea of necessity. In addition, when invoking necessity, a state may not “seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole”. In practice, this would seem to exclude the resort to forcible measures. Furthermore, necessity cannot be invoked if the “international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity”, or the “[s]tate has contributed to the situation of necessity”. Article 25 must also be read in conjunction with Article 26 of the draft articles according to which necessity cannot preclude “the wrongfulness of any act of a State which is not in conformity with an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law”. Finally, in order to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measures chosen must be the only ones available. If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.\n# 5 Conclusion\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain. As the states become more vocal – and certain – about how they can interpret the relevant parts of international law and international and national courts decide concrete cases involving computer\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, ibid., para. 51.\n See also ILC’s commentary to Article 25, ILC, supra note 121, p. 80 et seq., <http: incl=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" yearbooks=\"\">/ILC_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf/, visited on 7 February 2015.\n Ibid.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve. Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351",

The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt.

The article also examines the extent to which a plea of necessity may be invoked in order to justify the use of immediate defensive measures against cyber-attacks that may have an effect on other states.\n## Keywords\nlow level cyber-attack – sovereignty – due diligence – attribution – non-intervention – countermeasures – necessity\n* The author would like to thank Katrine Vedel Thisted for excellent student assistance.\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2015 | DOI 10.1163/15718107-08402008\nHENRIKSEN\n# 1 Introduction\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed that it had been the target of a cyber-attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data, such as unreleased movies. A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un. Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry. North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’. Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks. Hence, most of the contributions discuss when cyber-attacks may qualify as ‘armed attacks’ that will trigger a right to self-defence under the Charter of the United Nations or how the laws of war apply in a potential armed conflict in\nvisited on 13 December 2013.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'.[17] Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\".[18] While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users.[19] It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".[20]\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.dcaf.ch></www.rand.org></www.economist.com>\nHENRIKSEN\nAs mentioned above, this article explores immediate and lawful responses to harmful interferences in cyberspace. In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one. Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence. The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n Ibid., pp. 7–9; J. Arquilla and D. Ronfeldt, ‘Cyberwar is Coming!’, 12:2 Comparative Strategy (1993) pp. 141–165; L. Kello, ‘The Meaning of the Cyber Revolution: Perils to Theory and Statecraft’, 38 International Security (2013) pp. 7–50. Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n M.

In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards. Indeed, cyberspace never became self-regulated, it never became borderless and states never became\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</projects.eff.org></csis.org></www.dod.mil>\nHENRIKSEN\nabsent. On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”. In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.” With a few exceptions, then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein. To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.icj-cij.org></www>\nHENRIKSEN\nThe obligation is hard to apply in real life, however. Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation, it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm. It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct. Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\". To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\". The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nattacks' in cyberspace. Hence, the analysis will not discuss the parameters of the application of the right to self-defence to cyber-attacks.\n## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n### 3.1 Introduction\nInternational law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility. According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\". As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\" Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state. Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors. Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations and the measure\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nanother state will only constitute a violation of sovereignty if it causes a certain level of damage. Cyber-activities that only inflict very limited damage or that are merely routed through the infrastructure of the state would not violate international law. But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately. While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law. The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities, the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law. Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\" does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A. Deeks, 'An International Legal Framework for Surveillance', 55 Virginia Journal of International Law (forthcoming 2015).\n Ibid.\n Ziolkowski, supra note 63, 425–464. See also W.H.

Silver, 'Intelligence and Counterintelligence', in J.N. Moore and R.F. Turner (eds.), National Security Law (Carolina Academic Press, Durham, 2005) p. 935.

The well-known 2007 cyber-attacks on Estonia may serve as a case in point. The attacks occurred in the aftermath of an Estonia decision to relocate a Russian war memorial from the centre of the capital, Tallinn, to a military cemetery outside the city. The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question. As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n For more, see the reference in note 13.\n The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.cfr.org></www.thei3p.org>\nHENRIKSEN\nthe perpetrators of at least some harmful cyber-incidents. If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt. Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist. The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter. The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck. The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n D.E. Sanger and M. Facklerjan, 'N.S.A.

Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.fas.org>\nHENRIKSEN\nCaution is needed, however, as such offensive measures may easily end up conflicting with the parameters of lawful countermeasures. It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”. In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention, the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures, but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”. To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4). In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

When the UN Charter was drafted, a Brazilian proposal to extend the reach of the prohibition on the use of force to economic sanctions did not find support, see United Nations, Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, Vol. VI, pp. 720–721. In addition, both the 1970 UNGA Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations, supra note 71, and the 1987 UNGA Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations (A/RES/42/22) strongly indicate that Article 2(4) only covers the use of armed force.\n Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 39.\n Roscini, supra note 7, p. 106.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nThe Tallinn Manual lists eight factors that are meant to assist in identifying when cyber-attacks will be characterised as a use of force covered by Article 2(4). The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N.

As the Manual states, however, the factors listed are not meant to be exhaustive and, depending on the circumstances, a state may look to other factors, such as the prevailing political environment, the identity of the attacker and the nature of the target in order to determine if the cyber-activities in question constitute use of force for the purposes of article 2(4). In sum, then, it seems clear that a case-by-case evaluation is called for.\nSecondly, since offensive countermeasures in cyberspace could potentially infringe on rights associated with the free and unhindered flow of information in the target state, such as a right to privacy and the free flow of information, it is also important to note that under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures may not be aimed at “obligations for the protection of fundamental\n Ibid., p. 107.\n Ibid., pp. 108–109.\n See also, Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA Nominee for Commander, United States Cyber Command, <www.washingtonpost.com documents=\"\" questions.pdf=\"\" wp-srv=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.\n See also U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace - Remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, 18 September 2012, <www.state.gov l1=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" 197924.htm=\"\" releases=\"\" s=\"\" www.state.gov=\"\">, visited on 20 January 2014; Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 103; Barkham, supra note 7, p. 72; Lin, supra note 7, p. 73; Gill and Ducheine, supra note 7, p. 439; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 104–107; J.J.C.H.

It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state.[117] In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups.[118] These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\",[119] or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\".[120] In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org>\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n\nAn additional potential problem associated with resorting to offensive countermeasures in cyberspace relates to the fact that it may be difficult to limit the effects of a countermeasure to the targeted state and not unintentionally harm uninvolved third states. Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”, it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states. Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.\n See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>\nHENRIKSEN\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations. State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate. In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\". In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\". Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".\n## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace\nAs the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a.

At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\". For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\". The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n Ibid.

As mentioned above, an ‘essential interest’ must be at stake and international law also requires that the international obligation that is not fulfilled must be of a lesser weight. Thus, trivial cyber-disturbances cannot justify a plea of necessity. In addition, when invoking necessity, a state may not “seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole”. In practice, this would seem to exclude the resort to forcible measures. Furthermore, necessity cannot be invoked if the “international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity”, or the “[s]tate has contributed to the situation of necessity”. Article 25 must also be read in conjunction with Article 26 of the draft articles according to which necessity cannot preclude “the wrongfulness of any act of a State which is not in conformity with an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of general international law”. Finally, in order to be justified under the doctrine of necessity, the measures chosen must be the only ones available. If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.\n# 5 Conclusion\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain. As the states become more vocal – and certain – about how they can interpret the relevant parts of international law and international and national courts decide concrete cases involving computer\n Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, ibid., para. 51.\n See also ILC’s commentary to Article 25, ILC, supra note 121, p. 80 et seq., <http: incl=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" yearbooks=\"\">/ILC_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf/, visited on 7 February 2015.\n Ibid.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve. Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351"

The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. The article opens with a discussion of the application of the traditional principles of sovereignty to activities in cyberspace and subsequently analyses how the principles of countermeasures may be applied to various forms of harmful cyber-incidents that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence. The article also examines the extent to which a plea of necessity may be invoked in order to justify the use of immediate defensive measures against cyber-attacks that may have an effect on other states.\n## Keywords\nlow level cyber-attack – sovereignty – due diligence – attribution – non-intervention – countermeasures – necessity\n* The author would like to thank Katrine Vedel Thisted for excellent student assistance.\n© KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2015 | DOI 10.1163/15718107-08402008\nHENRIKSEN\n# 1 Introduction\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed that it had been the target of a cyber-attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data, such as unreleased movies. A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un.¹ Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack² and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry.³ North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.⁴\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns⁵\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’.⁶ Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks.

And while we have witnessed instances of extensive cyber campaigns conducted both during conventional military operations and in the immediate period leading up to a conventional military attack, we have yet to see the first cyberwar conducted entirely in cyberspace. Indeed, the notorious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 that accelerated much of the scholarly interest in identifying the legal framework governing computer network operations neither reached the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence nor initiated an armed conflict in cyberspace. In his response to the hacking of Sony, U.S. President Barack Obama was also careful to distance himself from any notion that the hacking was somehow tantamount to an 'act of war' and instead opted to use the term 'cyber-vandalism'. For the time being, then, the most pressing legal issues for those states, such as the Nordic countries, that are in the process of establishing national guidelines for countering harmful interferences in cyberspace relate not to responding to 'armed attacks' or to the proper conduct of a cyberwar as such, but rather to identifying the proper legal framework for responding to those harmful cyber-incidents that, though still a cause of concern and widespread disturbance, are of a much less serious character.\n11 One example would be the Russian cyber operations conducted during the 2008 international armed conflict with Georgia, see E.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

The article ends with a brief conclusion (section five). Before proceeding, however, some clarification is needed about the basic tenets of cyberspace and the various forms harmful cyber-interferences may take.\nIn contrast to the four physical domains (land, water, air and space), cyberspace is an entirely man-maid arena where humans and machines communicate and interact. In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'. Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\". While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users. It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".\n17 See e.g., M.

In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one.²¹ Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence.²² The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel²³ and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project²⁴ belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n²¹ Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n²² Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n²³ M.

It may also be to inflict civilian or military losses on another state by derailing trains, polluting drinking water or disrupting electricity supply. In such cases, the civilian infrastructure is 'weaponised' in the sense that it is not the 'cyber weapon' as such (the software code) that inflicts the injury or causes a kinetic effect, but rather the physical structure that is controlled by the computer or network under attack.26 A particular type of cyber-attacks consists of computer-enabled efforts to seize control of the opponent's weapons systems.27 In practice, of course, as the hacking of Sony illustrates, it may be very difficult to determine how one should classify a particular cyber-incident according to the three categories just listed and there is no doubt that some interferences in cyber-space may incorporate elements of two or even all three of the categories.\n## 2 Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIn the early to mid-1990s, cyberspace was often referred to as a new sort of domain – sui generis – that was somehow meant to be outside the reach of individual states. In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards. Indeed, cyberspace never became self-regulated, it never became borderless and states never became\n25 U.S. Department of Defense, United States National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations, November 2006, <www.dod.mil joint_staff=\"\" pubs=\"\" joint_staff_jointoperations=\"\" 07-f-2105doc1.pdf=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.

On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.²⁹\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”.³⁰ In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”³¹ With a few exceptions,³² then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein.³³ To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n34 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 126.

Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation,⁴² it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm.⁴³ It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct.⁴⁴ Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\".⁴⁵ To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\".⁴⁶ The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n⁴² See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n⁴³ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n⁴⁴ See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

These are cases of constructive knowledge where the state 'should have known' about cyber-attacks emanating from its territory.47 Consequently, it is unsettled if a territorial state violates its obligation to protect other states from harmful acts \"if it fails to use due care in policing cyber activities ... and is therefore unaware of the acts in question\".48 As Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg has noted, however, it may not make much of a practical difference if a standard of constructive knowledge is established or not. The technological configurations of cyberspace make it \"difficult, if not impossible\" to fulfil wide-ranging obligations to prevent potentially harmful activities from occurring.49 The authors of the manual could also not agree if the territorial state is obliged to stop cyber-attacks against other states that are merely routed through its infrastructure.50 Also in this regard, however, the technological issues involved may render an obligation meaningless because the \"data in question could simply be rerouted and then still reach the destination in the target State\".51\nPractical difficulties aside, the fundamental legal principle is clear: If a territorial state does not live up to its responsibility to protect other states from harmful cyber-attacks that emanate from its territory, it is breaching its international due diligence obligations towards the victim state. As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed\n47 Ibid., rule 5(11).\n48 Ibid. Clearly, this is an area in which there are inherent trade-offs between liberty and security at stake. Although there is little doubt that overall security would be enhanced if states were better at patrolling the cyber-activities that occur within their territories, there is also a limit as to how much governmental oversight that is desired. The more territorial states are required to protect other states from harmful activities, the more incentive the law creates for surveillance and other forms of interferences with the very freedoms that have always made cyberspace such a cherished space.\n49 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 137.\n50 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 5(12).\n51 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 138.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nHENRIKSEN\nattacks' in cyberspace. Hence, the analysis will not discuss the parameters of the application of the right to self-defence to cyber-attacks.\n## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n### 3.1 Introduction\nInternational law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law⁵² and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility.⁵³ According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\".⁵⁴ As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\"⁵⁵ Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state.⁵⁶ Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors.⁵⁷ Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations⁵⁸ and the measure\n⁵² Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

Furthermore, measures that are exerted as a means of revenge are unlawful. According to the ILC, countermeasures must be \"taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question\".59 Countermeasures must be reversible60 and the measures must be lifted as soon as the internationally wrongful act ceases.61\n## 3.2 A Breach of an International Obligation in Cyberspace\nAs mentioned above, a state can employ countermeasures against a state that breaches its obligations towards that state. This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n59 Ibid., Art. 49(3).

But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately.⁶⁵ While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law.⁶⁶ The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities,⁶⁷ the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law.⁶⁸ Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\"⁶⁹ does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.⁷⁰\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n⁶⁵ For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A.

The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question.⁸² As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n⁸⁰ Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n⁸¹ For more, see the reference in note 13.\n⁸² The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n341\nbehind false IP addresses, foreign servers and aliases, attackers can act with almost complete anonymity and relative impunity\".83 There is, in short, a well-known attribution problem in cyberspace.84 While this problem is most acute with regard to the use of measures of self-defence,85 it also limits the use of countermeasures. Two considerations are worth stressing, however.\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n83 Cornish et al., supra note 7, p. 13.\n84 In practical terms, the lack of knowledge of the identity of the aggressor will also make it difficult for the victim state to judge the motive and/or purpose of the activities in question, which in turn makes it hard for the state to determine the proper response. As Susan W. Brenner has noted, our domestic procedures for responding to harmful conduct depend on basic assumptions about the purpose of the conduct in question. See Brenner, supra note 16, pp. 379–475: See also D.B. Hollis, ‘An e-sos for Cyberspace’, 52:2 Harvard International Law Journal (2011) pp. 374–432 and J.

If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.⁸⁸\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁸⁹ Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.⁹⁰\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist.⁹¹ The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter.⁹² The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck.⁹³ The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n⁸⁸ D.E.

In practical terms, of course, both quantitative and qualitative elements may be of relevance.98\nIf a countermeasure is of such gravity that it appears to fail the proportionality test, it may be interpreted as revenge or punishment on the targeted state and therefore fall outside the boundaries of lawful countermeasures.99 It is important to note, however, that countermeasures need not be reciprocal in nature and that, in theory, nothing prevents a state from responding to a cyberattack by employing other than cyber-means. Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n94 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9(7).\n95 See Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 85.\n96 White and Abass, supra note 54, pp. 539–540.\n97 A.

It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.¹⁰³ In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention,¹⁰⁴ the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures,¹⁰⁵ but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”.¹⁰⁶ To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁷ In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n¹⁰³ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n¹⁰⁴ For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n¹⁰⁵ A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

When the UN Charter was drafted, a Brazilian proposal to extend the reach of the prohibition on the use of force to economic sanctions did not find support, see United Nations, Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, Vol. VI, pp. 720–721. In addition, both the 1970 UNGA Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations, supra note 71, and the 1987 UNGA Declaration on the Enhancement of the Effectiveness of the Principles of Refraining from the Threat or Use of Force in International Relations (A/RES/42/22) strongly indicate that Article 2(4) only covers the use of armed force.\n¹⁰⁶ Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, 8 July, ICJ, Advisory Opinion, para. 39.\n¹⁰⁷ Roscini, supra note 7, p. 106.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n345\nin their defence departments and debate the threat from cyber ‘warfare’ also strongly indicates that cyber-related capabilities, such as viruses etc., can be regarded as a form of weapon, and by extension, also some sort of armed force for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁸ Moreover, a number of states have stated that they consider cyber-attacks as a form of force to which they reserve the right to respond.¹⁰⁹ While doubt certainly remains,¹¹⁰ at present the prevailing opinion appears to be that computer network operations may constitute force under Article 2(4), if the effects of the attack resemble a conventional military attack or kinetic force.¹¹¹\nThe Tallinn Manual lists eight factors that are meant to assist in identifying when cyber-attacks will be characterised as a use of force covered by Article 2(4). The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N.

Although the commentary to the guidelines is silent with regard to what human rights it considers as 'fundamental,' it does refer to the fact that relevant human rights treaties list a number of human rights that may not be derogated from even in times of war or other public emergency. Privacy rights are not listed among such 'non-derogable' rights and this obviously indicates that countermeasures in cyberspace will usually not violate the ban on infringements of 'fundamental' rights. It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state. In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups. These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\", or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\". In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are\n115 ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)b.\n116 See the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, Art. 4; Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on Human rights, as amended) (ECHR) Art. 27.\n117 UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 8: The Relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights (E/C.12/1997/8) para. 4, <www.refworld.org 47a7079eo.html=\"\" docid=\"\" www.refworld.org=\"\">, visited 8 November 2014.\n118 Ibid, para. 14.\n119 ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)c.\n120 Ibid., Art. 50(1)d.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org>\nLAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n347\nnot of a peremptory nature.¹²¹ On an additional – and fourth – note, according to the ILC, the right to resort to countermeasures does not relieve a state from fulfilling its obligations under a relevant “dispute settlement” or “to respect the inviolability of diplomatic or consular agents, premises, archives and documents”.¹²²\nAn additional potential problem associated with resorting to offensive countermeasures in cyberspace relates to the fact that it may be difficult to limit the effects of a countermeasure to the targeted state and not unintentionally harm uninvolved third states. Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”,¹²³ it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states.¹²⁴ Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.¹²⁵\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.¹²⁶\n¹²¹ See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n¹²² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n¹²³ ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n¹²⁴ Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n¹²⁵ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n¹²⁶ See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>\nHENRIKSEN\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations.¹²⁷ State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate.¹²⁸ In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\".¹²⁹ In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\".¹³⁰ Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".¹³¹\n## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace\nAs the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for\n¹²⁷ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a.

In the most dire of circumstances, a plea of necessity may provide such an authority and necessity must therefore also be considered a potentially important supplement to countermeasures for those states that may need to respond to immediate and harmful cyber-activity.\nAs a concept under international law, reflected in Article 25 of the ILC's 2001 draft articles on state responsibility,¹³² necessity is a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act that otherwise breaches international law, and it relates to those rare cases where the only way for a state to safeguard an \"essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency\".¹³³ At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\".¹³⁴ For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\".¹³⁵ The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".¹³⁶\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances¹³⁷ and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n¹³² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n¹³³ Ibid.

If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.¹⁴⁵\n# 5 Conclusion\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve.¹⁴⁶ Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n¹⁴⁶ See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351"

The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt.

A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un.¹ Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack² and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry.³ North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.⁴ The Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns⁵ NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351 LAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS and that states are struggling to develop effective responses to counter the threat. The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’.⁶ Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks. Hence, most of the contributions discuss when cyber-attacks may qualify as ‘armed attacks’ that will trigger a right to self-defence under the Charter of the United Nations⁷ or how the laws of war apply in a potential armed conflict in visited on 13 December 2013.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be Options To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\"2014=\"\"apps=\"\"pdfresgo4=\"\"pbs.c.dll=\"\"article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'.[17] Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to\"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\".[18] While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users.[19] It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated,\"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".[20] NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.dcaf.ch></www.rand.org></www.economist.com> HENRIKSEN As mentioned above, this article explores immediate and lawful responses to harmful interferences in cyberspace. In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one.²¹ Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence.²² The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel²³ and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project²⁴ belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer ²¹ Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards.

On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.²⁹ Sovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”.³⁰ In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”³¹ With a few exceptions,³² then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein.³³ To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation\"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts\"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to\"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities\"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41 NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.icj-cij.org></www> HENRIKSEN The obligation is hard to apply in real life, however. Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation,⁴² it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm.⁴³ It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct.⁴⁴ Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is\"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\".⁴⁵ To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case\"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\".⁴⁶ The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to ⁴² See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n⁴³ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n⁴⁴ See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses. As indicated in the introduction, the focus of this article is on the latter category and not on 'armed NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351 HENRIKSEN attacks' in cyberspace. Hence, the analysis will not discuss the parameters of the application of the right to self-defence to cyber-attacks.\n## 3 Countermeasures in Cyberspace ### 3.1 Introduction International law allows a state that is the victim of another state's international wrongful acts to respond to the latter's acts by employing countermeasures. The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law⁵² and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility.⁵³ According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state\"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\".⁵⁴ As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated:\"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\"⁵⁵ Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state.⁵⁶ Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors.⁵⁷ Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations⁵⁸ and the measure ⁵² Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351 HENRIKSEN another state will only constitute a violation of sovereignty if it causes a certain level of damage.⁶⁴ Cyber-activities that only inflict very limited damage or that are merely routed through the infrastructure of the state would not violate international law. But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately.⁶⁵ While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law.⁶⁶ The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities,⁶⁷ the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law.⁶⁸ Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual\"trespass\"⁶⁹ does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole\"enterprise\"of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.⁷⁰ Regardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself, ⁶⁴ Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n⁶⁵ For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A. Deeks, 'An International Legal Framework for Surveillance', 55 Virginia Journal of International Law (forthcoming 2015).\n⁶⁶ Ibid.\n⁶⁷ Ziolkowski, supra note 63, 425–464. See also W.H.

Silver, 'Intelligence and Counterintelligence', in J.N. Moore and R.F. Turner (eds.), National Security Law (Carolina Academic Press, Durham, 2005) p. 935.

The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard The legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question.⁸² As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating ⁸⁰ Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n⁸¹ For more, see the reference in note 13.\n⁸² The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g., NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351 LAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS First of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify Hoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7. At the time of writing, however, international law is pretty clear, see also Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 111; and Barkham, supra note 7, p. 82.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.cfr.org></www.thei3p.org> HENRIKSEN the perpetrators of at least some harmful cyber-incidents. If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.⁸⁸ Nevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁸⁹ Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.⁹⁰ ## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace Countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist.⁹¹ The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter.⁹² The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck.⁹³ The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be\"commensurate with ⁸⁸ D.E. Sanger and M. Facklerjan, 'N.S.A.

Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100 Depending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable\"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may\"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102 NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.fas.org> HENRIKSEN Caution is needed, however, as such offensive measures may easily end up conflicting with the parameters of lawful countermeasures. It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.¹⁰³ In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention,¹⁰⁴ the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures,¹⁰⁵ but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”.¹⁰⁶ To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁷ In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands ¹⁰³ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n¹⁰⁴ For an interesting analysis, see M.C. Waxman, ‘Cyber-Attacks and the Use of Force: Back to the Future of Article 2(4)’, 36:2 Yale Journal of International Law (2011) p. 425.\n¹⁰⁵ A. Randelzhofer, ‘Article 2 (4)’, in B.

The factors, the majority of which were first developed by Michael N. Schmitt,¹¹² are severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability of effects, military character, state involvement and presumptive legality.¹¹³ As the Manual states, however, the factors listed are not meant to be exhaustive and, depending on the circumstances, a state may look to other factors, such as the prevailing political environment, the identity of the attacker and the nature of the target in order to determine if the cyber-activities in question constitute use of force for the purposes of article 2(4).¹¹⁴ In sum, then, it seems clear that a case-by-case evaluation is called for.\nSecondly, since offensive countermeasures in cyberspace could potentially infringe on rights associated with the free and unhindered flow of information in the target state, such as a right to privacy and the free flow of information, it is also important to note that under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures may not be aimed at “obligations for the protection of fundamental ¹⁰⁸ Ibid., p. 107.\n¹⁰⁹ Ibid., pp. 108–109.\n¹¹⁰ See also, Advance Questions for Lieutenant General Keith Alexander, USA Nominee for Commander, United States Cyber Command, <www.washingtonpost.com documents=\"\"questions.pdf=\"\"wp-srv=\"\"www.washingtonpost.com=\"\">, visited on 16 March 2014.\n¹¹¹ See also U.S. Department of State, International Law in Cyberspace - Remarks by Harold Hongju Koh, 18 September 2012, <www.state.gov l1=\"\"197924.htm=\"\"197924.htm=\"\"releases=\"\"s=\"\"www.state.gov=\"\">, visited on 20 January 2014; Dinstein, supra note 7, p. 103; Barkham, supra note 7, p. 72; Lin, supra note 7, p. 73; Gill and Ducheine, supra note 7, p. 439; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 104–107; J.J.C.H.

It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state.[117] In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups.[118] These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate\"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\",[119] or\"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\".[120] In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org> LAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS An additional potential problem associated with resorting to offensive countermeasures in cyberspace relates to the fact that it may be difficult to limit the effects of a countermeasure to the targeted state and not unintentionally harm uninvolved third states. Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”,¹²³ it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states.¹²⁴ Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.¹²⁵ Since countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.¹²⁶ ¹²¹ See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\"(yearbooks=\"\"iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\"publications=\"\"ybkvolumes(e)=\"\"ybkvolumes(e)=\"\"legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n¹²² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n¹²³ ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n¹²⁴ Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n¹²⁵ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n¹²⁶ See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:> HENRIKSEN Thus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements Before resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to\"call upon the responsible state\"to fulfil its international obligations.¹²⁷ State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of\"any decision to take countermeasures\"and be offered an opportunity to negotiate.¹²⁸ In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always\"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\".¹²⁹ In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that\"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\".¹³⁰ Cyber-attacks are often both\"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\"and, as such, also\"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".¹³¹ ## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace As the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for ¹²⁷ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a.

The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in\"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\".¹³⁴ For example\"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\".¹³⁵ The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is\"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".¹³⁶ As a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances¹³⁷ and that the\"state is not the sole judge\"of ¹³² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n¹³³ Ibid.

If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.¹⁴⁵ # 5 Conclusion A state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve.¹⁴⁶ Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n¹⁴⁶ See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351"

A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un.¹ Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack² and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry.³ North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.⁴\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns⁵\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’.⁶ Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks.

And while we have witnessed instances of extensive cyber campaigns conducted both during conventional military operations and in the immediate period leading up to a conventional military attack, we have yet to see the first cyberwar conducted entirely in cyberspace. Indeed, the notorious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007 that accelerated much of the scholarly interest in identifying the legal framework governing computer network operations neither reached the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence nor initiated an armed conflict in cyberspace. In his response to the hacking of Sony, U.S. President Barack Obama was also careful to distance himself from any notion that the hacking was somehow tantamount to an 'act of war' and instead opted to use the term 'cyber-vandalism'. For the time being, then, the most pressing legal issues for those states, such as the Nordic countries, that are in the process of establishing national guidelines for countering harmful interferences in cyberspace relate not to responding to 'armed attacks' or to the proper conduct of a cyberwar as such, but rather to identifying the proper legal framework for responding to those harmful cyber-incidents that, though still a cause of concern and widespread disturbance, are of a much less serious character.\n11 One example would be the Russian cyber operations conducted during the 2008 international armed conflict with Georgia, see E.

Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

The article ends with a brief conclusion (section five). Before proceeding, however, some clarification is needed about the basic tenets of cyberspace and the various forms harmful cyber-interferences may take.\nIn contrast to the four physical domains (land, water, air and space), cyberspace is an entirely man-maid arena where humans and machines communicate and interact. In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'. Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\". While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users. It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".\n17 See e.g., M.

In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one.²¹ Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence.²² The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel²³ and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project²⁴ belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n²¹ Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

Kello, ‘The Meaning of the Cyber Revolution: Perils to Theory and Statecraft’, 38 International Security (2013) pp. 7–50. Terms such as ‘cyberexploitation’ and ‘computer network exploitation’ are also used instead of ‘cyber-espionage’, as is the term ‘computer network attacks’ instead of ‘cyber-attack’.\n²² Kello, supra note 21, p. 20: “Essentially an intelligence-gathering activity, cyberexploitation relies on stealth and undetectability; thus disruption of the host system, which can lead to discovery and closure of access, defeats the purpose of exploitation.”\n²³ M.

It may also be to inflict civilian or military losses on another state by derailing trains, polluting drinking water or disrupting electricity supply. In such cases, the civilian infrastructure is 'weaponised' in the sense that it is not the 'cyber weapon' as such (the software code) that inflicts the injury or causes a kinetic effect, but rather the physical structure that is controlled by the computer or network under attack.26 A particular type of cyber-attacks consists of computer-enabled efforts to seize control of the opponent's weapons systems.27 In practice, of course, as the hacking of Sony illustrates, it may be very difficult to determine how one should classify a particular cyber-incident according to the three categories just listed and there is no doubt that some interferences in cyber-space may incorporate elements of two or even all three of the categories.\n\n---\n\n## # 5 Conclusion\n\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity. However, a number of important uncertainties about the concrete application of the law remain.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve.¹⁴⁶ Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n¹⁴⁶ See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351",

    "HENRIKSEN\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nIn late 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment confirmed that it had been the target of a cyber-attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data, such as unreleased movies. A group that called itself 'Guardians of Peace' took responsibility for the attack and subsequently threatened Sony, cinemas and anyone who were to attend the opening of a movie – The Interview – about North Korea that includes an assassination of its ruler Kim Jong-Un.¹ Unsurprisingly, the United States blamed North Korea for the attack² and officially responded by adopting (more) sanctions against the already sanctioned North Korean government officials and the North Korean defence industry.³ North Korea consistently denied any involvement in the hacking of Sony and instead accused the United States of reacting to the incident by cutting of the nation's already very limited connections to the Internet.⁴\n\nThe Sony hack and the American responses thereto – the first ever officially acknowledged response to a concrete cyber-attack – illustrate that disruptive cyber-attacks are becoming one of the most pressing national security concerns⁵\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351\n\n1.

The many efforts – also ongoing in the Nordic countries – to meet the challenges in cyberspace raise a wide range of issues under international law and the legal literature is currently booming with contributions within an emerging field of ‘the international law of cyberspace’, and in 2013 an international group of international law experts published an oft-cited manual on the topic – the so-called ‘Tallinn Manual’.⁶ Up until recently, however, the scholarly focus has almost exclusively been aimed at the most violent and potentially deadly of cyber-attacks.

Indeed, the notorious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Estonia in 2007[13] that accelerated much of the scholarly interest in identifying the legal framework governing computer network operations neither reached the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence[14] nor initiated an armed conflict in cyberspace. In his response to the hacking of Sony, U.S. President Barack Obama was also careful to distance himself from any notion that the hacking was somehow tantamount to an 'act of war' and instead opted to use the term 'cyber-vandalism'.[15] For the time being, then, the most pressing legal issues for those states, such as the Nordic countries, that are in the process of establishing national guidelines for countering harmful interferences in cyberspace relate not to responding to 'armed attacks' or to the proper conduct of a cyberwar as such, but rather to identifying the proper legal framework for responding to those harmful cyber-incidents that, though still a cause of concern and widespread disturbance, are of a much less serious character.[16]\n\n11 One example would be the Russian cyber operations conducted during the 2008 international armed conflict with Georgia, see E.

    "HENRIKSEN\n\nThe purpose of this article is to assist the states in doing exactly that, and hereby help fill a gap in the literature. Hence, the article discusses the sources of international law that may justify a state outside times of armed conflict to respond to harmful interferences in cyberspace that are not sufficiently serious to merit a resort to self-defence under the UN Charter. There are, of course, numerous ways whereby a state can decide to respond to harmful incidents, including harmful cyber-activities, occurring outside an armed conflict and not all reactions need be of a more or less reciprocal nature and involve the use of cyber-related means. As the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates, a state that is – or has been – targeted by another state's harmful cyber-activities may well decide to employ more traditional means of pressure and leverage, such as instigate economic pressure, suspend bilateral agreements or potentially bring the matter to the attention of the United Nations Security Council in the hope that the latter may pressure the responsible state to bring the harmful activities to a halt. Although more traditional types of responses may in the long term be the most effective and at times be considered a form of countermeasure, the primary aim of this article is to focus on the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. Hence, the analysis is based on the assumption that there is a sense of urgency in the situation that calls for immediate action.\n\nTo that end, and as a way of background, the article opens with a brief discussion of the traditional principles of sovereignty and their application in cyberspace (section two). Subsequently, the article will discuss how the principles of 'countermeasures' may be applied to various forms of cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence (section three) and then examine the extent to which a plea of 'necessity' may be\n\nOptions To Respond to Cyberattacks', Defense News, 23 January 2014, <www.defensenews.com 301230033=\"\" 2014=\"\" apps=\"\" pdfresgo4=\"\" pbs.c.dll=\"\" article?aid=\"√201401231228\">, visited on 29 March 2014.

The article ends with a brief conclusion (section five). Before proceeding, however, some clarification is needed about the basic tenets of cyberspace and the various forms harmful cyber-interferences may take.\n\nIn contrast to the four physical domains (land, water, air and space), cyberspace is an entirely man-maid arena where humans and machines communicate and interact. In military jargon, cyberspace is therefore often referred to as the 'fifth domain'.[17] Through the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum, cyberspace is an information environment that is tailored to \"create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via inter-connected information and communication technology-based systems and their associated infrastructure\".[18] While a precise definition of cyberspace is far from consensus, Martin Libicki's definition is a good point of departure. According to Libicki, cyberspace consists of three layers: A physical, a syntactic and a semantic. The 'physical' layer consists of computers, routers, cables, screens etc., and the 'syntactical' is made up of all the software and instructions that programmers and users give to a computer. It is also in this layer we find the protocols that enable computer-to-computer interaction and therefore also here that hackers will try to gain control of the instructions given to computers. The third layer is the 'semantic' layer that contains all the information that serves as a bridge between the machine and its human users.[19] It is important to note, however, that cyberspace consists of more than just the Internet. As Fred Schreier has stated, \"cyberspace includes the Internet plus lots of other networks of computers, including those that are not supposed to be accessible from the Internet\".[20]\n\n17 See e.g., M.

    "HENRIKSEN\n\nAs mentioned above, this article explores immediate and lawful responses to harmful interferences in cyberspace. In practice, of course, these interferences may come in many shapes and sizes and individual states may want to respond to a variety of harmful cyber-activities. At the outset, it is important to note that although the general tendency in the media and among some politicians is to use the term ‘cyber-attack’ as a generic term covering all forms of interferences in cyberspace, harmful cyber-activities are actually better classified according to three basic categories, among which ‘cyber-attacks’ are merely one.²¹ Thus, according to the literature, ‘cyber-crime’ covers all those acts that are not politically motivated, such as IT-related credit card fraud, bank account manipulation, identity theft, traditional forms of industrial espionage, cyber vandalism or the exchange of child pornography. Secondly, ‘cyber-espionage’ refers to politically motivated intrusions into other states’ (or private actors’) computer networks with the intent of gaining access to information. Unlike traditional cyber-attacks (see below), successful acts of cyber-espionage do not require manipulation of information or data. To the contrary, it usually requires an invisible digital presence.²² The U.S. National Security Agency’s notorious alleged interception and recording of phone calls made by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel²³ and alleged Chinese state-sponsored espionage aimed at Lockeed Martin’s Joint Strike Fighter-project²⁴ belongs in this category of hostile cyber-activities. Lastly, the term ‘cyber-attack’ is limited to politically or strategically motivated hostile cyber-activities that “disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer\n\n²¹ Ibid., pp. 7–9; J.

It may also be to inflict civilian or military losses on another state by derailing trains, polluting drinking water or disrupting electricity supply. In such cases, the civilian infrastructure is 'weaponised' in the sense that it is not the 'cyber weapon' as such (the software code) that inflicts the injury or causes a kinetic effect, but rather the physical structure that is controlled by the computer or network under attack.26 A particular type of cyber-attacks consists of computer-enabled efforts to seize control of the opponent's weapons systems.27 In practice, of course, as the hacking of Sony illustrates, it may be very difficult to determine how one should classify a particular cyber-incident according to the three categories just listed and there is no doubt that some interferences in cyber-space may incorporate elements of two or even all three of the categories.\n\n## 2 Sovereignty in Cyberspace\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, cyberspace was often referred to as a new sort of domain – sui generis – that was somehow meant to be outside the reach of individual states. In contrast to the physical domains (land, sea, air and space), cyberspace was supposed to be governed not by the classic international legal concepts of state sovereignty and jurisdiction, but by the users themselves.28 While cyberspace undoubtedly differs in many ways from the physical domains, there is (no longer) any basis for the claim that it should somehow be governed by entirely different legal standards.

On the contrary, states are becoming ever more present in cyberspace and everybody seems to agree that the fundamental principles of sovereignty must also apply in cyberspace.²⁹\n\nSovereignty is one of the pillars of international law and mutual state respect for territorial sovereignty is “an essential foundation of international relations”.³⁰ In practical terms, both rights and obligations flow from the principles of territorial sovereignty. First of all, territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. In addition, the territorial state also has the exclusive right to exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over its territory, including its territorial sea, air-space, and on vessels and aircrafts registered in the state. As the Permanent Court of Arbitration stated in the Island of Palmas case: “Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State.”³¹ With a few exceptions,³² then, the territorial state can exercise and enforce its jurisdiction over those parts of cyberspace that can be said to reside within this area and over the cyber-activities therein.³³ To that end, it must be reiterated that cyberspace is not just a virtual domain, but also built around a physical layer of infrastructure consisting of computers, routers, servers, cables etc. that, unless positioned on the high seas, will be placed on the territory and therefore jurisdiction of one or more states. Similarly, the users of cyberspace will be physically located in some national jurisdiction when they press the keys on their dashboards creating cyber-activity.

As the International Court of Justice has stated on numerous occasions, every state is under an obligation \"not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States\".36 When it comes to cyber-activities, then, a state must not knowingly allow its cyber-infrastructure to be used for activities that are harmful to other states.37 This is also reflected in a 2013 report from the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security.38 According to the Tallinn Manual, the obligation to protect other states covers those acts \"that are unlawful and that have detrimental effects on another State (whether those effects occur on another State's territory or on objects protected under international law)\".39 The notion of 'unlawful' refers to \"an activity that is contrary to the legal rights of the affected State\",40 and it covers all cyber activities \"that affect the rights of other States and have detrimental effects on another State's territory\".41\n\n34 Heinegg, supra note 16, p. 126.

    "HENRIKSEN\n\nThe obligation is hard to apply in real life, however. Notably, states are bound to disagree on what acts, exactly, the territorial state must protect other states from. Criminal laws differ from state to state for a reason. Another difficulty relates to the lengths the territorial state must go to in order to stop the harmful cyber-activities. Assuming there is agreement on the harmful nature of the activities in question, how much energy and how many resources must the territorial state put into stopping them? While case law from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) illustrates that the obligation to stop harmful activities against other states is a 'due diligence' obligation,⁴² it is still unclear how that concept should be applied in the cyber-realm.⁴³ It is also important to note that the due diligence obligation is not an obligation of result, but merely of conduct.⁴⁴ Hence, the territorial state need not necessarily succeed in stopping the acts in question in order to fulfil its obligations. It also bears mentioning that the majority of 'cyberspace' is actually owned and operated by private companies, so in order to fulfil its due diligence obligation and effectively try to put a stop to harmful cyber-activities against another state, a territorial state will often require the cooperation of private actors, such as internet providers. The extent to which such cooperation is possible may depend on the content of relevant domestic laws. In such instances, according to the Tallinn Manual, the territorial state is \"obliged to use all means at its disposal to require that entity to take the action needed to terminate the activity\".⁴⁵ To this must be added yet another practical difficulty. As indicated, the obligation to protect other states from harmful acts only applies to acts that the territorial state has knowledge of – but when is 'knowledge' established? According to the Tallinn Manual, 'knowledge' exists when the territorial state has actual knowledge of the acts in question and that will be the case \"if, for example, State organs such as intelligence agencies have detected a cyber-attack originating from its territory or if the state has received credible information (perhaps from the victim state) that a cyber-attack is underway from its territory\".⁴⁶ The authors of the manual could not agree, however, about the status of the law in those instances where the state does not have actual knowledge but could obtain such knowledge if it actively searched for indications that its infrastructure was about to\n\n⁴² See Pulp Mills, supra note 36, para. 101.\n⁴³ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, p. 636.\n⁴⁴ See also Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia Hercegovina v.

These are cases of constructive knowledge where the state 'should have known' about cyber-attacks emanating from its territory.47 Consequently, it is unsettled if a territorial state violates its obligation to protect other states from harmful acts \"if it fails to use due care in policing cyber activities ... and is therefore unaware of the acts in question\".48 As Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg has noted, however, it may not make much of a practical difference if a standard of constructive knowledge is established or not. The technological configurations of cyberspace make it \"difficult, if not impossible\" to fulfil wide-ranging obligations to prevent potentially harmful activities from occurring.49 The authors of the manual could also not agree if the territorial state is obliged to stop cyber-attacks against other states that are merely routed through its infrastructure.50 Also in this regard, however, the technological issues involved may render an obligation meaningless because the \"data in question could simply be rerouted and then still reach the destination in the target State\".51\n\nPractical difficulties aside, the fundamental legal principle is clear: If a territorial state does not live up to its responsibility to protect other states from harmful cyber-attacks that emanate from its territory, it is breaching its international due diligence obligations towards the victim state. As a consequence, the victim state may be entitled to resort to various measures in order to stop the harmful acts in question. In practical terms, the nature of the immediate response that is available to the victim state depends on the intensity of the attack in question. Generally international law distinguishes between, on the one hand, those (rare) attacks on a state that are so intense and serious as to qualify as an 'armed attack' that triggers a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and, on the other, those attacks that, while still constituting a violation of international law, are less serious and therefore merely trigger the application of other, less drastic, immediate responses.

The relevant principles on countermeasures are found in customary international law⁵² and in the International Law Commission's (ILC) 2001 articles on state responsibility.⁵³ According to Article 22 in the draft articles, a state is entitled to breach its international obligations towards another state \"if and to the extent that the act constitutes a countermeasure taken against the latter State\".⁵⁴ As the tribunal in the US-French Air Services Arbitration case stated: \"If a situation arises, which in one State's view, results in the violation of an international obligation by another State, the first State is entitled ... to affirm its right through 'countermeasures'.\"⁵⁵ Hence, to the extent that a state suffers an unlawful cyber-activity from another state, it may be entitled to breach its international obligations, including obligations in cyberspace, towards that state.⁵⁶ Notably, countermeasures cannot only be employed in response to cyber-activities perpetrated by states, but also, depending on the circumstances, in the situation where another state breaches its due diligence international obligations by knowingly allowing its territory to be used for cyber-activities contrary to the rights of other states committed by private actors.⁵⁷ Although the cyber-activity in question is not committed by the territorial state, it is responsible for its failure to stop them.\n\nThe purpose of a countermeasure against unlawful activities in cyberspace is to induce a state to comply with its international obligations⁵⁸ and the measure\n\n⁵² Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

According to the ILC, countermeasures must be \"taken in such a way as to permit the resumption of performance of the obligations in question\".59 Countermeasures must be reversible60 and the measures must be lifted as soon as the internationally wrongful act ceases.61\n\n## 3.2 A Breach of an International Obligation in Cyberspace\n\nAs mentioned above, a state can employ countermeasures against a state that breaches its obligations towards that state. This, of course, raises the question concerning when a state breaches its legal obligations towards another state in cyberspace. What is a lawful and what is an unlawful cyber-activity? In practical terms, international law draws the line between those activities in cyberspace that constitute a violation of sovereignty of another state and those that do not.\n\nThe overview in section two illustrated that territorial sovereignty is exclusive in the sense that a state must refrain from exercising its authority on the territory of other states. So with a few exceptions,62 any state activity directed at objects or infrastructure in another state constitutes a prima facie violation of the latter state's sovereignty. If, for example, a state sends its agents into another state in order to secure the arrest of a suspected criminal in the absence of consent from the territorial state, it will violate that state's sovereignty; like sending an airplane into the airspace of another state without permission will violate the territorial state's airspace and constitute a violation of sovereignty. In theory, then, all cyber-activities by state A on or against infrastructure in state B must constitute a violation of the latter's territorial sovereignty and therefore entail a breach of international law.\n\nIn practice, however, states may find that there is a substantial difference between a state's physical presence, i.e., in the form of agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, and a virtual presence with electronic signals.63 The law does not appear settled on the issue, and according to the Tallinn Manual a computer network operation on the electronic infrastructure of\n\n59 Ibid., Art. 49(3).

But if it is true that a state's mere 'virtual' unauthorised presence on the electronic infrastructure of another state is insufficient to constitute a violation of sovereignty, and hence a breach of international law, it will have potentially far-reaching implications for the conduct of cyber-espionage, a topic that has been receiving increasing attention lately.⁶⁵ While the act of collecting intelligence is usually proscribed under domestic law, its status is less clear in international law.⁶⁶ The seemingly most prevalent view appears to hold that one must distinguish between, on the one hand, the gathering of intelligence as such and, on the other, the means whereby that gathering is done. Thus, while the mere collection of intelligence does not in itself violate international law unless it targets individuals, documents or locations/facilities specifically protected under international law from such activities,⁶⁷ the traditional means whereby the actual spying is done, such as the unauthorised insertion of foreign agents or airplanes on the territory of another state, usually constitute a violation of sovereignty and therefore also a breach of international law.⁶⁸ Obviously, if a mere unauthorised virtual \"trespass\"⁶⁹ does not suffice to constitute a violation of sovereignty, the whole \"enterprise\" of cyber-espionage would appear not to be proscribed by international law at all.⁷⁰\n\nRegardless of where the exact baseline should be drawn between those cyber-activities that constitute a violation of sovereignty and those that do not, it is well-established that some of those acts that constitute a violation of sovereignty may also violate the principle of 'non-intervention'. The latter principle springs from the sovereign equality of states and, like the principle of sovereignty itself,\n\n⁶⁴ Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 1(6).\n⁶⁵ For a thorough overview of surveillance issues and international law, see A.

The decision was unpopular with both the Russian minority in Estonia and among a number of Russian politicians in Moscow. Estonia has subsequently indicated that it was hackers in Russia, potentially supported by the Russian state-apparatus, who were responsible for the attacks. If Russia was responsible for the attacks and if these were intended to coerce the Estonia politicians to undo their decision to remove the war memorial, they would appear to constitute an example of unlawful intervention.\n\nIt follows from what is mentioned above that harmful cyber-activities not aimed at changing the policies of the targeted state cannot constitute an unlawful ‘intervention’. Hence, attacks against private entities, such as private corporations or non-governmental organisations, would not appear to be able to qualify. So while the hacking of Sony allegedly perpetrated by North Korea may well constitute as a violation of American sovereignty (the hacking was conducted on US territory) and on that basis be a violation of international law that could trigger an American right to initiate countermeasures, it cannot be considered an unlawful intervention.\n\n## 3.3 The Problem of Attribution and Evidentiary Standard\n\nThe legal framework on countermeasures provides that a state targeted by harmful cyber-incidents, which fall below the threshold to trigger the right of self-defence, must bring the incidents in question to a halt. In practice, however, the initiation of countermeasures is often hampered by the fact that it is very difficult indeed for a state to ascertain who is responsible for the harmful cyber-incidents in question.⁸² As a Chatham House report noted, “[o]perating\n\n⁸⁰ Joyner and Lotrionte, supra note 7, p. 849; Roscini, supra note 7, pp. 102–103.\n\n⁸¹ For more, see the reference in note 13.\n\n⁸² The international rules of state responsibility operate with a relatively high threshold for attribution. Under Art. 8 in the ILC draft articles on state responsibility, supra note 45, and case-law from the International Court of Justice, a state is only responsible for wrongful acts committed by a person or group of persons, such as hackers, if the latter “is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct”, see Nicaragua, supra note 71, para. 115, Armed Activities, supra note 71, para. 160, Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, supra note 44. The high threshold for attribution is a cause of great frustration and it is therefore no surprise that some scholars want to introduce a lower threshold, see e.g.,\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351",
    "LAWFUL STATE RESPONSES TO LOW-LEVEL CYBER-ATTACKS\n341\n\nbehind false IP addresses, foreign servers and aliases, attackers can act with almost complete anonymity and relative impunity\".83 There is, in short, a well-known attribution problem in cyberspace.84 While this problem is most acute with regard to the use of measures of self-defence,85 it also limits the use of countermeasures. Two considerations are worth stressing, however.\n\nFirst of all, in order to have the authority to initiate countermeasures against another state's unlawful cyber-related activities, the initiating state need not necessarily prove that the other state was itself responsible for the harmful activities. There is not, in other words, a requirement to show that it was state agents, such as members of a cyber-command, who perpetrated the harmful cyber-incidents in question. It suffices to show that the harmful incidents originated from the targeted state and that the latter did not fulfil its due diligence obligations to try to bring the activities to a halt.86 And while tracing the location of the computer from which harmful cyber-incidents are perpetrated is far from easy, it is still much easier than identifying the individual that operates the computer. Secondly, although there is much debate among technical experts about the prospects of developing new techniques that may help alleviate the attribution problem,87 the American response to the hacking of Sony may very well illustrate that it is not entirely impossible that states are able to identify\n\nHoisington, supra note 7, p. 453 and Joyner and Lotrione, supra note 7.

As Susan W. Brenner has noted, our domestic procedures for responding to harmful conduct depend on basic assumptions about the purpose of the conduct in question.

If we are to trust publicly available information, the Americans were allegedly able to trace the hacking to North Korean governmental actors because the United States' National Security Agency (N.S.A.) had managed to place malware into North Korean computers and networks that could monitor and track the internal workings of the hackers in question.⁸⁸\n\nNevertheless, the problems associated with attribution are substantial and they therefore raise the question of the relevant standard of proof. How certain must state A be that harmful cyber-disturbances originates from state B? How much evidence is required? In practical terms, the potential standards of proof could be one of four: A mere prima facie possibility that an allegation is true; a preponderance of evidence; a standard of 'clear and convincing' evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubt.⁸⁹ Practice from, among others, the ICJ regarding the use of force strongly indicates that the right standard is one of 'clear and convincing' evidence.⁹⁰\n\n## 3.4 Proportionality and Proscribed Countermeasures in Cyberspace\n\nCountermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace must be proportionate and strike a fair balance between the initial breach of international law that the cyber-incident entails and the measures taken by the victim state. The question concerns, of course, what the measure must be proportionate with. In practice, two approaches exist.⁹¹ The first is to measure the proportionality of a countermeasure against the gravity of the breach the measure is supposed to counter.⁹² The purpose of such a 'tit-for-tat' approach is to avoid escalation, and it appears to be supported by, among others, Thomas Franck.⁹³ The other approach would hold that the countermeasure should be \"commensurate with\n\n⁸⁸ D.E.

In practical terms, of course, both quantitative and qualitative elements may be of relevance.98\n\nIf a countermeasure is of such gravity that it appears to fail the proportionality test, it may be interpreted as revenge or punishment on the targeted state and therefore fall outside the boundaries of lawful countermeasures.99 It is important to note, however, that countermeasures need not be reciprocal in nature and that, in theory, nothing prevents a state from responding to a cyberattack by employing other than cyber-means. Indeed, as indicated in the introduction to this article, the American response to the hacking of Sony illustrates that a state may very well decide that it is more feasible to respond to unlawful cyber-activities by resorting to non-cyber related means, such as economic pressure or the termination of bilateral agreements. In practice, however, it is more likely that a reciprocal response in cyberspace will be considered proportionate than a physical response.100\n\nDepending on the circumstances, a state may be justified in responding to harmful cyber-activities by initiating its own set of 'offensive-defensive' cyber operations as long as such measures are aimed at making the targeted state comply with its international obligations. In its 1999 assessment, the U.S. Department of Defence noted that, if capable \"the victim nation may be justified in launching a computer attack in response, intended to disable the equipment being used by the intruder\".101 Such an operation may \"serve as a 'shot across the bow' warning of more serious consequences if the offending behaviour continues\".102\n\n94 Schmitt, supra note 6, rule 9(7).\n95 See Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project, supra note 52, para. 85.\n96 White and Abass, supra note 54, pp. 539–540.\n97 A.

    "HENRIKSEN\n\nCaution is needed, however, as such offensive measures may easily end up conflicting with the parameters of lawful countermeasures. It is vital to note that some international obligations are of such a fundamental character that they can never be subjected to countermeasures. Under the guidelines of the ILC, countermeasures shall not affect “the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations”.¹⁰³ In practice, then, a state is not allowed to counter a cyber-attack that does not reach the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence with its own offensive computer network operations if these constitute a use of ‘force’ under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. While the relationship between ‘force’ and computer network operations recently has been the focus of much scholarly attention,¹⁰⁴ the concept of force itself has been debated ever since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The traditional view holds that ‘force’ only covers armed measures,¹⁰⁵ but it cannot be ruled out that at least some forms of computer network operations may be proscribed by the prohibition in Art. 2(4). In its advisory opinion on *Nuclear Weapons*, the ICJ noted that the relevant provisions in the UN Charter “do not refer to specific weapons”, but instead “apply to any use of force, regardless of the weapons used. The UN Charter neither expressly prohibits, nor permits, the use of any specific weapon”.¹⁰⁶ To that end, it is worth noting that since no one seems to dispute that new forms of biological and chemical warfare, lasers, and other innovative technologies, may constitute as forms of military or armed force, it seems that a ‘weapon’ must not necessarily have an explosive effect to be considered relevant for the purposes of Article 2(4).¹⁰⁷ In addition, the fact that states include cyber technology in their military doctrines, establish cyber commands\n\n¹⁰³ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)a.\n¹⁰⁴ For an interesting analysis, see M.C.

It is worth noting, however, that the commentary also refers to a 1997 general comment on the relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights issued by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that note the important distinction between applying political and economic pressure on the governing elites of a state and the collateral infliction of suffering upon the most vulnerable groups within the targeted state.[117] In the comment, the Committee also states that the party imposing sanctions on a state is obliged to take steps to respond to any disproportionate suffering experienced by vulnerable groups.[118] These references indicate that countermeasures in cyberspace must be imposed in such a manner that potential negative effects on the civilian population are generally minimised. In practice, then, even reciprocal offensive responses in cyberspace that cannot be sufficiently limited may be incompatible with international law, in particular if there is a risk that they may effect critical infrastructure.\n\nThirdly, according to the guidelines from the ILC, countermeasures may similarly not violate \"obligations of a humanitarian character prohibiting reprisals\",[119] or \"other obligations under peremptory norms of general international law\".[120] In practice, with the possible exception of countermeasures that may affect critical infrastructure, neither of these restrictions appear to be relevant with regard to countermeasures in cyberspace. While rights associated with communication are undoubtedly of great importance, they are\n\n115 ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)b.\n116 See the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (adopted 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976) 999 UNTS 171, Art. 4; Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (European Convention on Human rights, as amended) (ECHR) Art. 27.\n117 UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 8: The Relationship between economic sanctions and respect for economic, social and cultural rights (E/C.12/1997/8) para. 4, <www.refworld.org 47a7079eo.html=\"\" docid=\"\" www.refworld.org=\"\">, visited 8 November 2014.\n118 Ibid, para. 14.\n119 ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(1)c.\n120 Ibid., Art. 50(1)d.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</www.refworld.org>",

Due to the configurations of cyberspace and the risk of cascading effects, an effort to target one particular target may simply result in causing harm to other targets. According to the ILC commentaries, although countermeasures “may not be directed against States other than the responsible State”,¹²³ it does not mean that countermeasures may not incidentally affect uninvolved third states.¹²⁴ Nevertheless, before initiating countermeasures in cyberspace, a state must take every possible measure to avoid affecting a third party and if that is not possible, keep the cascading impacts on third states to a minimum. If the state realises that the countermeasures in question cannot be resorted to in such a way that it does not spread uncontrollably and causes damage to uninvolved third states’ systems, the countermeasures in question should be considered unlawful and trigger the international responsibility of the initiating state.¹²⁵\n\nSince countermeasures must be aimed at inducing the targeted state to comply with its international obligations, measures initiated after the unlawful cyber-activity has ceased would appear to fall within the category of revenge and be prima facie incompatible with the notion of lawful countermeasures. Exceptions might be made, however, in those circumstances where a state is confronted not by a single unlawful cyber-incident, but a series of incidents that take the form of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents and where it becomes clear the territorial state is either responsible for the attacks or clearly refrains from fulfilling its obligation to try to bring the activities to a halt.¹²⁶\n\n¹²¹ See also the enumeration in International Law Commission, ‘Draft articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts, with commentaries’, 2:2 Yearbook of International Law Commission (A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1) p. 132, paras. 6–9, <http: (ilc=\"\" (yearbooks=\"\" iclc_2001_v2_p2_e.pdf=\"\" publications=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" ybkvolumes(e)=\"\" legal.un.org=\"\">, visited on 7 February 2015.\n\n¹²² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 50(2).\n\n¹²³ ILC, supra note 121, p. 130, para. 4.\n\n¹²⁴ Ibid., p. 130, para. 5.\n\n¹²⁵ See also Geiss and Lahmann, supra note 16, pp. 640–641.\n\n¹²⁶ See also the discussion in ibid., pp. 638–639.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351</http:>",
    "HENRIKSEN\n\nThus, despite the fact that the American response to the hacking of Sony that was allegedly perpetrated by North Korea came after the unlawful cyber-incident was over, the American response could in theory fall within the boundaries of lawful countermeasures if the United States can prove that the unlawful cyber-activities aimed at Sony were part of a campaign of harmful cyber-incidents perpetrated either by North Korea itself or from North Korean territory and the local authorities did not try to bring the activities to a halt.\n\n## 3.5 Procedural Requirements\n\nBefore resorting to countermeasures against unlawful acts in cyberspace, a state is required to \"call upon the responsible state\" to fulfil its international obligations.¹²⁷ State A may therefore not initiate its countermeasure against State B until it becomes clear that the latter does not stop its violations of international law in cyberspace. In addition, the responsible state must be notified of \"any decision to take countermeasures\" and be offered an opportunity to negotiate.¹²⁸ In practice, these procedural requirements may make it difficult for a state to initiate the necessary countermeasures to cyber-attacks that often appear out of nowhere and it is therefore of great practical importance that the draft articles make it clear that the injured state may always \"take such urgent countermeasures as are necessary to preserve its rights\".¹²⁹ In this regard, it is hard to disagree with Katharine C. Hinkle who notes that \"the nature of cyber-force weighs in favour of an injured state resorting rapidly, and with broad discretion, to countermeasures\".¹³⁰ Cyber-attacks are often both \"unexpected and capable of significantly impairing critical infrastructure\" and, as such, also \"more likely to be viewed as 'emergency scenarios' justifying reasonable state discretion in employing countermeasures\".¹³¹\n\n## 4 Necessity as a Circumstance Precluding the Wrongfulness and Cyberspace\n\nAs the overview above illustrated, while the option of resorting to proportionate countermeasures will provide a state at least some authority for responding to those harmful cyber-attacks from abroad that fall below the threshold for\n\n¹²⁷ ILC, supra note 53, Art. 52(1)a.

In the most dire of circumstances, a plea of necessity may provide such an authority and necessity must therefore also be considered a potentially important supplement to countermeasures for those states that may need to respond to immediate and harmful cyber-activity.\n\nAs a concept under international law, reflected in Article 25 of the ILC's 2001 draft articles on state responsibility,¹³² necessity is a circumstance that precludes the wrongfulness of an act that otherwise breaches international law, and it relates to those rare cases where the only way for a state to safeguard an \"essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril is, for the time being, not to perform some other international obligation of lesser weight or urgency\".¹³³ At least some parts of a state's critical infrastructure may be considered 'essential interests' worth protecting, and as modern societies become ever more dependent on a well-functioning and reliable cyberspace, the more likely it is that disruptive cyber-activities will be considered as affecting the critical infrastructure of a state. The option of advancing a plea of necessity as a justification for countering harmful cyber-incidents is also mentioned in the Tallinn Manual, according to which such a plea can be made in \"cases where the exact nature and, in particular, origin of a cyber-incident are unclear\".¹³⁴ For example \"if a State is faced with a cyber-incident that endangers its essential interests and there is no other way to address the situation, it may in some cases temporarily shut off certain cyber infrastructure, even if doing so affects cyber systems in other States (sic)\".¹³⁵ The manual also states that a plea of necessity could justify 'counter-hacking' in a situation where a state is \"faced with significant cyber operations against a State's critical infrastructure\".¹³⁶\n\nAs a legal tool to respond to unlawful cyber-attacks, a plea of necessity does, however, have a number of severe limitations. Most importantly, case law from the ICJ and the ILC commentary illustrate that necessity can only be invoked in exceptional circumstances¹³⁷ and that the \"state is not the sole judge\" of\n\n¹³² ILC, supra note 53, Art. 25(1).\n¹³³ Ibid.

If other and less intrusive means of redress exist, necessity cannot be invoked.¹⁴⁵\n\n# 5 Conclusion\n\nA state targeted by harmful cyber-attacks that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence can lawfully try to bring the attack to a halt by resorting to proportionate countermeasures and, in some circumstances at least, plea necessity.

In addition, official reactions and public statements like those following the hacking of Sony enhance transparency and enable public and scholarly debate on the right application of the law within the area. That said, we should probably not expect all issues to be resolved in the near future. As Matthew Waxman has persuasively argued, the debate about how international law regulates cyber-related measures is also a debate about how states believe international law should regulate such measures, and on such issues, agreement will be difficult to achieve.¹⁴⁶ Like other states that are in the process of developing effective responses to counter the threat from harmful cyber-attacks, the Nordic countries will therefore have to come to terms with the fact that they will be operating in an area of substantial legal uncertainty.\n\n¹⁴⁶ See Waxman, supra note 104, p. 425.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 84 (2015) 323-351"

The focus is primarily aimed at the more immediate measures a targeted state may adopt in order to bring on-going harmful cyber-activities to a halt. The article opens with a discussion of the application of the traditional principles of sovereignty to activities in cyberspace and subsequently analyses how the principles of countermeasures may be applied to various forms of harmful cyber-incidents that fall below the threshold for triggering a right to self-defence. The article also examines the extent to which a plea of necessity may be invoked in order to justify the use of immediate defensive measures against cyber-attacks that may have an effect on other states.",
