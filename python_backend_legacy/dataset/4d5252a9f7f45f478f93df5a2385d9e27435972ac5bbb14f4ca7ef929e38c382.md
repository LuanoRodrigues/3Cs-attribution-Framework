Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent¹ and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber\n* Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n1 Some authors consider the notion 'cyber threat' to delineate the pre-stage of a cyber attack, see for example Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law, Eleven International Publishing, 2012, pp. 5 ff. The term 'cyber warfare' is used to describe malicious cyber activities during war times; see for an extensive discussion the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press, 2017, and can thus be clearly distinguished from possibly one-time 'cyber vandalism' actions.\nZLW 67.

At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet² determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s³ and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades.⁴ Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.⁵\nThe interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”.⁶ Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater,⁷ will circumscribe cyberspace as follows:\n2 The ‘Internet’ physically comprises all globally interconnected computer networks and other services available through and therein. Although the world wide web is only one of the services provided by the Internet, sometimes the two notions are used synonymously.\n3 Based on a research project of the Defense Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense, in 1969 the predecessor to the Internet, ARPANET, was developed as a digital network for exchange of data between dissimilar networks through software protocols.\n4 After some US universities became interconnected in the 1980s, the European Organization for Nuclear Research made the world wide web a massively usable service which made it possible that the Internet grew exponentially and became globally functional.\n5 Hobe, Cyberspace – der virtuelle Raum, in: Isensee/Kirchhof (eds.), Handbuch des Staatsrechts, Band XI, Internationale Bezüge, 3rd. ed., 2013, p. 255.\n6 Gibson, Neuromancer, The Berkeley Publishing Group, 1984.\n7 Slater, Social relationships and identity online and offline, in: Lievrouw/Livingstone (eds.), Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs, Sage Publications, 2002, pp. 533 et seq.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"\nIt is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word \"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n8 On the idea of cyberspace as the “fourth global common”, see Menthe, Jurisdiction in Cyberspace: A Theory of International Spaces, Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review, Vol 4 (No. 1) 1998.\n9 In fact, it is this “uniformity” of protocols which makes the Internet a global, interoperable network using only one language: TCP/IP.\n10 Jellinek, Allgemeine Staatslehre, 3rd. ed., Berlin 1914.\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices¹¹ has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space,¹² interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network¹³ results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n## I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats\nThe main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n### 1. Technical Factors\nThe technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n[257]\n---\n¹¹ At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n¹² Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n¹³ Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung\nthermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced.¹⁴ This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017,¹⁵ which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing.¹⁶ Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006,¹⁷ while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the \"surface web\" or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden \"Deep Web\" not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.¹⁸\n## 2. Regulatory Factors\nThe regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for\nZLW 67.

As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts¹⁹ may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.\n## II. Statistics on Cyber Threats\nThe occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015.²⁰ In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015.²¹ Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.²²\nOn the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc.²³ The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber\n19 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n20 In 2016, Panda Security reported that “More than a quarter of all malware samples ever recorded were produced in 2015 (27.63%)”, see https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/all-recorded-malware-appeared-in-2015/ (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n21 See Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity in Europe, Factsheet on cybersecurity, European Commission, available online at http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=46998 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n22 Turnaround and Transformation in Cybersecurity: Retail and Consumer: Key Findings from the PWC Global State of Information Security Survey 2016, https://www.pwc.ru/en/retail-consumer/publications/assets/2016_gsiss_rc.pdf and http://news.sap.com/pwc-study-biggest-increase-in-cyberattacks-in-over-10-years (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n23 January 2018 Cyber Statistics as provided by Hackmageddon, see online at: https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018/02/22/january-2018-cyber-attacks-statistics/ (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67.

The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges.²⁴ Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA²⁵ and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated.²⁶ This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes²⁷, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\n24 Stuxnet 'hit' Iran nuclear plans, BBC News, 22 November 2010, http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11809827 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n25 U.S. 2018 elections 'under attack' by Russia: U.S. intelligence chief, Reuters, 13 February 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-russia-elections/u-s-2018-elections-under-attack-by-russia-u-s-intelligence-chief-idUSKCN1FX1Z8 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n26 Severin/Shalal, German government under cyber attack, shores up defences, March 1st, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber/german-government-under-cyber-attack-shores-up-defenses-idUSKCN1GD4C8 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n27 In 2016, Cybersecurity Ventures predicted that cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015. This “will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined”, see 2017 Cybercrime Market Report, Herjavec Group/Cybersecurity Ventures, available online at https://cybersecurityventures.com/2015-wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-Cybercrime-Report.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.²⁸\nSummarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace.²⁹ In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n28 Bond, Critical infrastructure threat as new malware is identified, Financial Times, 14 December 2017, https://www.ft.com/content/1bbae590-e0df-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n29 See, for example, Sieber, The Emergence of Information Law: Object and Characteristics of a New Legal Area, in: Lederman/ Shapira (eds.), Law, Information and Information Technology, Kluwer Law International, 2001.\nAbhandlung\n# I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIf one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle.³⁰ However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors.³¹ However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n30 For an extensive account on the basis for state jurisdiction, see, for example, Oxman, Jurisdiction of States, Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law, November 2007.\n31 For a discussion on the role of non-state actors in international law in the context of cyber law, see Schmitt/Watts, Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-state Actors in Cyberspace, Journal of Conflict and Security Law, Vol. 21, Issue 3, 1 December 2016, pp. 595–611.\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and \"playground\" for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation\nSovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle,³² or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.³³\n# 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDespite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance³⁴ difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nFirst, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders.³⁵ Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would\nthe evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nstimulate or enhance the imposing of regulatory restrictions and laws over the virtual domain.\nThis does not, however, mean that no regulatory approach to activities in the Internet could be followed³⁶ or that there is a full legal vacuum with regard to cyberspace. Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace\nDuring the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.³⁷\nAt first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery.³⁸ This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced.³⁹ The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.⁴⁰\n## 1.

Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet,⁴² but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)⁴³, establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)⁴⁴ and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)⁴⁵ or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment,⁴⁶ the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber-\n41 Convention on Cybercrime, Council of Europe, CETS No. 185, concluded on 23 November 2001, entered into force on 7 January 2004.\n42 ITU’s Role with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses: Resolution 102 [Rev.

Self-Regulation in Cyberspace\nIn 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet⁵¹ by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet.⁵² The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994⁵³ and has been tasked with the development of\n47 Http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:0477:FIN (last accessed on 3 April 2017).\n48 For the so-called Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox see: https://www.ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/EU-170607-CyberDiplomacyToolbox.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2017).\n49 European Cybercrime Centre - EC3, https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3 (last accessed on 3 April 2017).\n50 Feick/Werle, Regulation of Cyberspace, in: Baldwin/Cave/Lodge (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Regulation, Oxford University Press, 2010.\n51 See Section 1 of the ICANN bylaws as amended in 2017, available online at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/governance/bylaws-en.\n52 See IETF’s website https://www6.ietf.org/ and S.

While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code: \"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the \"protocol language\" and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.\n## III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies\nAlthough the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.\nOn the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to\n54 See generally Lessig, Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, 1999, The Law of the Horse: What Cyber-law Might Teach, 113 Harvard Law Review 1999, p. 501 ff. and p. 533.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US$^{55}$, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, $^{56}$ have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes$^{57}$ and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.$^{58}$\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n55 See, for example, the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, “Fraud and related activity in connection with computers” (as amended in 2006).\n56 Ibid., § 1030 (a) 2-7.\n57 Cyber Crime, Federal Bureau of Investigation, https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n58 Fact Sheet: Cybersecurity National Plan, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nAbhandlung\nprocesses in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.⁵⁹\nAnother state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems.⁶⁰ Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.⁶¹\nChina is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States.⁶² A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016⁶³ which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.⁶⁴\nThe national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014⁶⁵ and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.⁶⁶\n⁵⁹ According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target.⁶⁸ Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities⁶⁹ will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n⁶⁷ Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n# D. Perspectives\n## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.⁷⁰\nAlthough not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force).⁷¹ However, as some interventions\n⁷⁰ While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n⁷¹ On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention⁷² and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to.⁷³ Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.⁷⁴\nIn this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility⁷⁵ hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs⁷⁶ but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organi-\nbridge University Press, 2017.\n72 The customary character of the non-intervention principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, 1986 ICJ Reports 14.\n73 See Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 7 ff.\n74 See Dunlap, Towards a Cyberspace Legal Regime in the 21 century: Considerations for American Cyber Warriors, Nebraska Law Review 2009, pp. 712 ff.\n75 As codified in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n76 Ibid., Art. 4.\nZLW 67.

This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78\nSo far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80\nIn the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations$^{82}$ and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols$^{83}$ meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space\nCyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nnecessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects$^{84}$ – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility$^{85}$ one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n84 On the notion of ‘control’ in space law, see Schmidt-Tedd/Mick, Article VIII, in: Hobe/Schmidt-Tedd/Schrogl (eds.), Cologne Commentary on Space Law (Vol. I), Carl Heymanns, 2009, pp. 57 f.\n85 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nIt is obvious that there are more questions than answers as to the legal avenues concerning possible harmful activities originating from cyberspace and that the legal field of cyber law will have to evolve and adapt very dynamically to the rapid and highly complex technical challenges which cyberspace creates.\nThe analysis of the relevant international law, on the one hand, and national laws, on the other, shows that while existing legal concepts may be generally applicable to cyberspace, they do not provide an encompassing framework for its regulation. Nevertheless, they represent some initial basis for specifically tailored legal rules for cyberspace as one of the emerging global domains for human activities which produce effects in all spheres of life on all thinkable levels – from single private daily lives, through big-scale business relations to government activities and state interactions.\nNational regulation of cyberspace is so far the most feasible instrument but as its effectivity on a broader scale is restricted by the limitations of sovereignty as opposed to the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace, probably a coordinated combination of international, regional and national rules may be required. Moreover, for the development of such complex rules the efforts of the traditional lawmakers as incorporated in state legislative powers will have to rely on the vital support of non-governmental entities rooted in cyberspace as they will provide the needed technical and practical understanding of the issues needing regulation.\nThus, summarizing it can be stated that it is rather doubtful at the moment whether regulation of cyberspace can remain a sole governmental exercise. As of yet however, it is unclear when it will become a consolidated multi-actor effort including governments, IGOs, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.\nThe Institute of Air and Space Law has been conducting theoretical research and expanding its expertise on cyber matters since its 90th anniversary in 2015 - in particular through its involvement in projects such as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations and the work of the IISL Working Group on Cyber Law[86] which the Institute's Director had the honor to chair.

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber\n* Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nattacks. At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades. Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.\nThe interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”. Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater, will circumscribe cyberspace as follows:\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"\nIt is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word \"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space, interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n## I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats\nThe main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n### 1. Technical Factors\nThe technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n[257]\n---\n At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung\nthermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced. This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017, which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing. Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006, while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the \"surface web\" or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden \"Deep Web\" not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.\n## 2. Regulatory Factors\nThe regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nlaw and governance to keep up with the pace of the technological development. As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.\n## II. Statistics on Cyber Threats\nThe occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015. In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015. Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.\nOn the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc. The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nwarfare and 1,7 % of so-called “hacktivism” – an activism in the Internet aiming at promoting political or social agendas.\nIn the timeline of cyber attacks, a few major incidents have gained wide attention. The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges. Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated. This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.\nSummarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace. In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nAbhandlung\n# I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIf one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle. However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors. However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and \"playground\" for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation\nSovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle, or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.\n# 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDespite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nFirst, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders. Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would\nthe evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes. See also Mayntz, The Changing Governance of Large Technical Infrastructure Systems, in: Mayntz (ed.), Über Governance: Institutionen und Prozesse Politischer Regelung, Campus, 2009, pp. 121 ff.\n On the global validity of IP addresses, domain names, and Internet standards, see Bendrath/Hofmann/Leib/Mayer/Zürn, Governing the Internet: The Quest for Legitimacy and Effective Rules, in: Hurrelmann/Leibfried/Martens/Mayer (eds.), Transforming the Golden-Age Nation State, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nstimulate or enhance the imposing of regulatory restrictions and laws over the virtual domain.\nThis does not, however, mean that no regulatory approach to activities in the Internet could be followed or that there is a full legal vacuum with regard to cyberspace. Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace\nDuring the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.\nAt first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery. This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced. The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.\n## 1. International and Regional Regulatory Attempts\nSo far, states have not come to an agreement on international cyberspace governance. Apart from the only binding international instrument on cybercrime, the 2001 Bu\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\ndapest Convention, an international regulatory framework for cyber activities does not yet exist. Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet, but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive) or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment, the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsecurity Act\") and a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities.\nFurthermore, Europol has been tasked with the harmonization of national cybercrime laws and established a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in 2013 to “strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime”.\nHowever, the regulation of cyberspace as a technical infrastructure and condition for transmission of content which should aim at shaping the general opportunities and constraints of utilising the Internet is not that well developed and is predominantly existing on the basis of private self-regulation.\n## 2. Self-Regulation in Cyberspace\nIn 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet. The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994 and has been tasked with the development of\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nstandards for the world wide web. While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code: \"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the \"protocol language\" and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.\n## III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies\nAlthough the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.\nOn the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US$^{55}$, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, $^{56}$ have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes$^{57}$ and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.$^{58}$\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nAbhandlung\nprocesses in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.\nAnother state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems. Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.\nChina is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States. A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016 which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.\nThe national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014 and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.\n According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nAlso the Russian Federation which along with China and the USA is considered to dispose of vast cyber capacities, has enacted a national strategy originally incorporated in the 2000 Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation which was updated in 2016.\nIn sum, states play a significant role in establishing some regulatory framework to ensure better cybersecurity. They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target. Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n# D. Perspectives\n## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.\nAlthough not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force). However, as some interventions\n While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to. Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.\nIn this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organi-\nbridge University Press, 2017.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nzation or providing equipment to persons carrying out the conduct.77 Particularly in virtual space, however, evidence thereof may be very difficult to demonstrate.\nTherefore, it should be considered whether or not a malicious cyber activity which has been identified to originally come from the territory of a particular state must be attributed to the state whether or not the action came from a de jure governmental organ or from a de facto organ, when the state has provided considerable support in the form of planning, coordination and organisation of the activity. This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78\nSo far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80\nIn the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable. Such application of international humanitar-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations$^{82}$ and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols$^{83}$ meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space\nCyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nnecessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects$^{84}$ – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility$^{85}$ one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nIt is obvious that there are more questions than answers as to the legal avenues concerning possible harmful activities originating from cyberspace and that the legal field of cyber law will have to evolve and adapt very dynamically to the rapid and highly complex technical challenges which cyberspace creates.\nThe analysis of the relevant international law, on the one hand, and national laws, on the other, shows that while existing legal concepts may be generally applicable to cyberspace, they do not provide an encompassing framework for its regulation. Nevertheless, they represent some initial basis for specifically tailored legal rules for cyberspace as one of the emerging global domains for human activities which produce effects in all spheres of life on all thinkable levels – from single private daily lives, through big-scale business relations to government activities and state interactions.\nNational regulation of cyberspace is so far the most feasible instrument but as its effectivity on a broader scale is restricted by the limitations of sovereignty as opposed to the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace, probably a coordinated combination of international, regional and national rules may be required. Moreover, for the development of such complex rules the efforts of the traditional lawmakers as incorporated in state legislative powers will have to rely on the vital support of non-governmental entities rooted in cyberspace as they will provide the needed technical and practical understanding of the issues needing regulation.\nThus, summarizing it can be stated that it is rather doubtful at the moment whether regulation of cyberspace can remain a sole governmental exercise. As of yet however, it is unclear when it will become a consolidated multi-actor effort including governments, IGOs, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.\nThe Institute of Air and Space Law has been conducting theoretical research and expanding its expertise on cyber matters since its 90th anniversary in 2015 - in particular through its involvement in projects such as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations and the work of the IISL Working Group on Cyber Law[86] which the Institute's Director had the honor to chair.

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent¹ and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber * Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nattacks. At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet² determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s³ and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades.⁴ Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.⁵ The interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”.⁶ Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater,⁷ will circumscribe cyberspace as follows: ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"It is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word\"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices¹¹ has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space,¹² interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network¹³ results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).",
    "I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats The main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.": "### 1. Technical Factors The technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 [257] --- ¹¹ At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n¹² Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n¹³ Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung thermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced.¹⁴ This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017,¹⁵ which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing.¹⁶ Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006,¹⁷ while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the\"surface web\"or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden\"Deep Web\"not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.¹⁸ ## 2. Regulatory Factors The regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nlaw and governance to keep up with the pace of the technological development. As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts¹⁹ may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.",
    "II. Statistics on Cyber Threats The occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015.²⁰ In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015.²¹ Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.²² On the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc.²³ The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung warfare and 1,7% of so-called “hacktivism” – an activism in the Internet aiming at promoting political or social agendas.": "In the timeline of cyber attacks, a few major incidents have gained wide attention. The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges.²⁴ Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA²⁵ and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated.²⁶ This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes²⁷, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.²⁸ Summarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace.²⁹ In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung # I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace If one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle.³⁰ However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors.³¹ However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and\"playground\"for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation Sovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle,³² or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.³³ # 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace Despite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance³⁴ difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung First, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders.³⁵ Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would the evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes.

Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nstimulate or enhance the imposing of regulatory restrictions and laws over the virtual domain.\nThis does not, however, mean that no regulatory approach to activities in the Internet could be followed³⁶ or that there is a full legal vacuum with regard to cyberspace. Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace During the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.³⁷ At first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery.³⁸ This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced.³⁹ The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.⁴⁰ ## 1. International and Regional Regulatory Attempts So far, states have not come to an agreement on international cyberspace governance. Apart from the only binding international instrument on cybercrime, the 2001 Bu ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung dapest Convention,⁴¹ an international regulatory framework for cyber activities does not yet exist. Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet,⁴² but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)⁴³, establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)⁴⁴ and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)⁴⁵ or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment,⁴⁶ the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsecurity Act\")⁴⁷ and a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities.⁴⁸ Furthermore, Europol has been tasked with the harmonization of national cybercrime laws and established a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in 2013 to “strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime”.⁴⁹ However, the regulation of cyberspace as a technical infrastructure and condition for transmission of content which should aim at shaping the general opportunities and constraints of utilising the Internet is not that well developed and is predominantly existing on the basis of private self-regulation.⁵⁰ ## 2. Self-Regulation in Cyberspace In 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet⁵¹ by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet.⁵² The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994⁵³ and has been tasked with the development of ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung standards for the world wide web. While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code:\"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the\"protocol language\"and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.",
    "III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies Although the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.": "On the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung processes in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.⁵⁹ Another state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems.⁶⁰ Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.⁶¹ China is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States.⁶² A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016⁶³ which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.⁶⁴ The national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014⁶⁵ and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.⁶⁶ ⁵⁹ According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target.⁶⁸ Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities⁶⁹ will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n⁶⁷ Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung # D. Perspectives ## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.⁷⁰ Although not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force).⁷¹ However, as some interventions ⁷⁰ While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n⁷¹ On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention⁷² and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to.⁷³ Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.⁷⁴ In this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility⁷⁵ hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs⁷⁶ but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organibridge University Press, 2017.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung zation or providing equipment to persons carrying out the conduct.77 Particularly in virtual space, however, evidence thereof may be very difficult to demonstrate.\nTherefore, it should be considered whether or not a malicious cyber activity which has been identified to originally come from the territory of a particular state must be attributed to the state whether or not the action came from a de jure governmental organ or from a de facto organ, when the state has provided considerable support in the form of planning, coordination and organisation of the activity. This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78 So far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80 In the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable. Such application of international humanitar- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space Cyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung necessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.",

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber\n* Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n\nZLW 67.

At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades. Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.\nThe interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”. Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater, will circumscribe cyberspace as follows:\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"\nIt is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word \"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space, interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n## I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats\nThe main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n### 1. Technical Factors\nThe technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n[257]\n---\n At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung\nthermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced. This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017, which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing. Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006, while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the \"surface web\" or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden \"Deep Web\" not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.\n## 2. Regulatory Factors\nThe regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nlaw and governance to keep up with the pace of the technological development. As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.\n## II. Statistics on Cyber Threats\nThe occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015. In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015. Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.\nOn the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc. The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nwarfare and 1,7 % of so-called “hacktivism” – an activism in the Internet aiming at promoting political or social agendas.\nIn the timeline of cyber attacks, a few major incidents have gained wide attention. The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges. Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated. This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.\nSummarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace. In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nAbhandlung\n# I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIf one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle. However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors. However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and \"playground\" for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation\nSovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle, or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.\n# 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDespite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nFirst, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders. Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would\nthe evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes. See also Mayntz, The Changing Governance of Large Technical Infrastructure Systems, in: Mayntz (ed.), Über Governance: Institutionen und Prozesse Politischer Regelung, Campus, 2009, pp. 121 ff.\n On the global validity of IP addresses, domain names, and Internet standards, see Bendrath/Hofmann/Leib/Mayer/Zürn, Governing the Internet: The Quest for Legitimacy and Effective Rules, in: Hurrelmann/Leibfried/Martens/Mayer (eds.), Transforming the Golden-Age Nation State, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nstimulate or enhance the imposing of regulatory restrictions and laws over the virtual domain.\nThis does not, however, mean that no regulatory approach to activities in the Internet could be followed or that there is a full legal vacuum with regard to cyberspace. Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace\nDuring the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.\nAt first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery. This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced. The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.\n## 1. International and Regional Regulatory Attempts\nSo far, states have not come to an agreement on international cyberspace governance. Apart from the only binding international instrument on cybercrime, the 2001 Bu\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\ndapest Convention, an international regulatory framework for cyber activities does not yet exist. Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet, but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive) or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment, the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsecurity Act\") and a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities.\nFurthermore, Europol has been tasked with the harmonization of national cybercrime laws and established a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in 2013 to “strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime”.\nHowever, the regulation of cyberspace as a technical infrastructure and condition for transmission of content which should aim at shaping the general opportunities and constraints of utilising the Internet is not that well developed and is predominantly existing on the basis of private self-regulation.\n## 2. Self-Regulation in Cyberspace\nIn 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet. The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994 and has been tasked with the development of\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nstandards for the world wide web. While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code: \"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the \"protocol language\" and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.\n## III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies\nAlthough the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.\nOn the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US$^{55}$, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, $^{56}$ have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes$^{57}$ and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.$^{58}$\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nAbhandlung\nprocesses in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.\nAnother state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems. Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.\nChina is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States. A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016 which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.\nThe national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014 and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.\n According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nAlso the Russian Federation which along with China and the USA is considered to dispose of vast cyber capacities, has enacted a national strategy originally incorporated in the 2000 Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation which was updated in 2016.\nIn sum, states play a significant role in establishing some regulatory framework to ensure better cybersecurity. They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target. Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n# D. Perspectives\n## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.\nAlthough not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force). However, as some interventions\n While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to. Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.\nIn this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organi-\nbridge University Press, 2017.\n\nZLW 67.

This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78\nSo far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80\nIn the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable. Such application of international humanitar-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations$^{82}$ and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols$^{83}$ meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space\nCyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nnecessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects$^{84}$ – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility$^{85}$ one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nIt is obvious that there are more questions than answers as to the legal avenues concerning possible harmful activities originating from cyberspace and that the legal field of cyber law will have to evolve and adapt very dynamically to the rapid and highly complex technical challenges which cyberspace creates.\nThe analysis of the relevant international law, on the one hand, and national laws, on the other, shows that while existing legal concepts may be generally applicable to cyberspace, they do not provide an encompassing framework for its regulation. Nevertheless, they represent some initial basis for specifically tailored legal rules for cyberspace as one of the emerging global domains for human activities which produce effects in all spheres of life on all thinkable levels – from single private daily lives, through big-scale business relations to government activities and state interactions.\nNational regulation of cyberspace is so far the most feasible instrument but as its effectivity on a broader scale is restricted by the limitations of sovereignty as opposed to the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace, probably a coordinated combination of international, regional and national rules may be required. Moreover, for the development of such complex rules the efforts of the traditional lawmakers as incorporated in state legislative powers will have to rely on the vital support of non-governmental entities rooted in cyberspace as they will provide the needed technical and practical understanding of the issues needing regulation.\nThus, summarizing it can be stated that it is rather doubtful at the moment whether regulation of cyberspace can remain a sole governmental exercise. As of yet however, it is unclear when it will become a consolidated multi-actor effort including governments, IGOs, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.\nThe Institute of Air and Space Law has been conducting theoretical research and expanding its expertise on cyber matters since its 90th anniversary in 2015 - in particular through its involvement in projects such as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations and the work of the IISL Working Group on Cyber Law[86] which the Institute's Director had the honor to chair. The Institute of Air and Space Law is ready to take up the legal challenges posed by cyberspace as well\nThe latest report on the IISL Working Group is available online at http://iislweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IISL-Working-Group-on-Cyber-Law_final.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67.

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber\n* Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nattacks. At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades. Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.\nThe interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”. Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater, will circumscribe cyberspace as follows:\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"\nIt is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word \"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space, interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n## I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats\nThe main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n### 1. Technical Factors\nThe technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n[257]\n---\n At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung\nthermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced. This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017, which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing. Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006, while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the \"surface web\" or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden \"Deep Web\" not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.\n## 2. Regulatory Factors\nThe regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nlaw and governance to keep up with the pace of the technological development. As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.\n## II. Statistics on Cyber Threats\nThe occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015. In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015. Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.\nOn the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc. The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nwarfare and 1,7 % of so-called “hacktivism” – an activism in the Internet aiming at promoting political or social agendas.\nIn the timeline of cyber attacks, a few major incidents have gained wide attention. The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges. Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated. This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.\nSummarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace. In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nAbhandlung\n# I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIf one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle. However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors. However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and \"playground\" for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation\nSovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle, or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.\n# 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDespite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nFirst, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders. Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would\nthe evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nstimulate or enhance the imposing of regulatory restrictions and laws over the virtual domain.\nThis does not, however, mean that no regulatory approach to activities in the Internet could be followed or that there is a full legal vacuum with regard to cyberspace. Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace\nDuring the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.\nAt first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery. This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced. The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.\n## 1. International and Regional Regulatory Attempts\nSo far, states have not come to an agreement on international cyberspace governance. Apart from the only binding international instrument on cybercrime, the 2001 Bu\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\ndapest Convention, an international regulatory framework for cyber activities does not yet exist. Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet, but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive) or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment, the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsecurity Act\") and a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities.\nFurthermore, Europol has been tasked with the harmonization of national cybercrime laws and established a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in 2013 to “strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime”.\nHowever, the regulation of cyberspace as a technical infrastructure and condition for transmission of content which should aim at shaping the general opportunities and constraints of utilising the Internet is not that well developed and is predominantly existing on the basis of private self-regulation.\n## 2. Self-Regulation in Cyberspace\nIn 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet. The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994 and has been tasked with the development of\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nstandards for the world wide web. While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code: \"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the \"protocol language\" and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.\n## III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies\nAlthough the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.\nOn the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US$^{55}$, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, $^{56}$ have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes$^{57}$ and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.$^{58}$\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\nAbhandlung\nprocesses in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.\nAnother state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems. Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.\nChina is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States. A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016 which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.\nThe national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014 and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.\n According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nAlso the Russian Federation which along with China and the USA is considered to dispose of vast cyber capacities, has enacted a national strategy originally incorporated in the 2000 Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation which was updated in 2016.\nIn sum, states play a significant role in establishing some regulatory framework to ensure better cybersecurity. They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target. Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n# D. Perspectives\n## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.\nAlthough not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force). However, as some interventions\n While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to. Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.\nIn this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organi-\nbridge University Press, 2017.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nzation or providing equipment to persons carrying out the conduct.77 Particularly in virtual space, however, evidence thereof may be very difficult to demonstrate.\nTherefore, it should be considered whether or not a malicious cyber activity which has been identified to originally come from the territory of a particular state must be attributed to the state whether or not the action came from a de jure governmental organ or from a de facto organ, when the state has provided considerable support in the form of planning, coordination and organisation of the activity. This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78\nSo far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80\nIn the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable. Such application of international humanitar-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations$^{82}$ and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols$^{83}$ meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space\nCyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nnecessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects$^{84}$ – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility$^{85}$ one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nIt is obvious that there are more questions than answers as to the legal avenues concerning possible harmful activities originating from cyberspace and that the legal field of cyber law will have to evolve and adapt very dynamically to the rapid and highly complex technical challenges which cyberspace creates.\nThe analysis of the relevant international law, on the one hand, and national laws, on the other, shows that while existing legal concepts may be generally applicable to cyberspace, they do not provide an encompassing framework for its regulation. Nevertheless, they represent some initial basis for specifically tailored legal rules for cyberspace as one of the emerging global domains for human activities which produce effects in all spheres of life on all thinkable levels – from single private daily lives, through big-scale business relations to government activities and state interactions.\nNational regulation of cyberspace is so far the most feasible instrument but as its effectivity on a broader scale is restricted by the limitations of sovereignty as opposed to the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace, probably a coordinated combination of international, regional and national rules may be required. Moreover, for the development of such complex rules the efforts of the traditional lawmakers as incorporated in state legislative powers will have to rely on the vital support of non-governmental entities rooted in cyberspace as they will provide the needed technical and practical understanding of the issues needing regulation.\nThus, summarizing it can be stated that it is rather doubtful at the moment whether regulation of cyberspace can remain a sole governmental exercise. As of yet however, it is unclear when it will become a consolidated multi-actor effort including governments, IGOs, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.\nThe Institute of Air and Space Law has been conducting theoretical research and expanding its expertise on cyber matters since its 90th anniversary in 2015 - in particular through its involvement in projects such as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations and the work of the IISL Working Group on Cyber Law[86] which the Institute's Director had the honor to chair.

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent¹ and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber\n* Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n1 Some authors consider the notion 'cyber threat' to delineate the pre-stage of a cyber attack, see for example Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law, Eleven International Publishing, 2012, pp. 5 ff. The term 'cyber warfare' is used to describe malicious cyber activities during war times; see for an extensive discussion the Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cambridge University Press, 2017, and can thus be clearly distinguished from possibly one-time 'cyber vandalism' actions.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nattacks. At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet² determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s³ and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades.⁴ Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.⁵\nThe interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”.⁶ Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater,⁷ will circumscribe cyberspace as follows:\n2 The ‘Internet’ physically comprises all globally interconnected computer networks and other services available through and therein. Although the world wide web is only one of the services provided by the Internet, sometimes the two notions are used synonymously.\n3 Based on a research project of the Defense Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense, in 1969 the predecessor to the Internet, ARPANET, was developed as a digital network for exchange of data between dissimilar networks through software protocols.\n4 After some US universities became interconnected in the 1980s, the European Organization for Nuclear Research made the world wide web a massively usable service which made it possible that the Internet grew exponentially and became globally functional.\n5 Hobe, Cyberspace – der virtuelle Raum, in: Isensee/Kirchhof (eds.), Handbuch des Staatsrechts, Band XI, Internationale Bezüge, 3rd. ed., 2013, p. 255.\n6 Gibson, Neuromancer, The Berkeley Publishing Group, 1984.\n7 Slater, Social relationships and identity online and offline, in: Lievrouw/Livingstone (eds.), Handbook of New Media: Social Shaping and Consequences of ICTs, Sage Publications, 2002, pp. 533 et seq.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"\nIt is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word \"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the\nZLW 67.

Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space,¹² interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network¹³ results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n## I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats\nThe main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n### 1. Technical Factors\nThe technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n\n---\n¹¹ At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n¹² Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n¹³ Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung\nthermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced.¹⁴ This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017,¹⁵ which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing.¹⁶ Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006,¹⁷ while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the \"surface web\" or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden \"Deep Web\" not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.¹⁸\n## 2. Regulatory Factors\nThe regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for\nZLW 67.

As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts¹⁹ may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.\n## II. Statistics on Cyber Threats\nThe occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015.²⁰ In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015.²¹ Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.²²\nOn the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc.²³ The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber\n19 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n20 In 2016, Panda Security reported that “More than a quarter of all malware samples ever recorded were produced in 2015 (27.63%)”, see https://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/all-recorded-malware-appeared-in-2015/ (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n21 See Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity in Europe, Factsheet on cybersecurity, European Commission, available online at http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=46998 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n22 Turnaround and Transformation in Cybersecurity: Retail and Consumer: Key Findings from the PWC Global State of Information Security Survey 2016, https://www.pwc.ru/en/retail-consumer/publications/assets/2016_gsiss_rc.pdf and http://news.sap.com/pwc-study-biggest-increase-in-cyberattacks-in-over-10-years (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n23 January 2018 Cyber Statistics as provided by Hackmageddon, see online at: https://www.hackmageddon.com/2018/02/22/january-2018-cyber-attacks-statistics/ (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67.

The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges.²⁴ Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA²⁵ and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated.²⁶ This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes²⁷, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\n24 Stuxnet 'hit' Iran nuclear plans, BBC News, 22 November 2010, http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11809827 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n25 U.S. 2018 elections 'under attack' by Russia: U.S. intelligence chief, Reuters, 13 February 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-russia-elections/u-s-2018-elections-under-attack-by-russia-u-s-intelligence-chief-idUSKCN1FX1Z8 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n26 Severin/Shalal, German government under cyber attack, shores up defences, March 1st, 2018, https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber/german-government-under-cyber-attack-shores-up-defenses-idUSKCN1GD4C8 (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n27 In 2016, Cybersecurity Ventures predicted that cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, up from $3 trillion in 2015. This “will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combined”, see 2017 Cybercrime Market Report, Herjavec Group/Cybersecurity Ventures, available online at https://cybersecurityventures.com/2015-wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-Cybercrime-Report.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.²⁸\nSummarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace.²⁹ In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67.

Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nIf one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle.³⁰ However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors.³¹ However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n30 For an extensive account on the basis for state jurisdiction, see, for example, Oxman, Jurisdiction of States, Max Planck Encyclopedia of International Law, November 2007.\n31 For a discussion on the role of non-state actors in international law in the context of cyber law, see Schmitt/Watts, Beyond State-Centrism: International Law and Non-state Actors in Cyberspace, Journal of Conflict and Security Law, Vol. 21, Issue 3, 1 December 2016, pp. 595–611.\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and \"playground\" for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation\nSovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle,³² or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.³³\n# 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace\nDespite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance³⁴ difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nFirst, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders.³⁵ Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would\nthe evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes.

Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace\nDuring the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.³⁷\nAt first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery.³⁸ This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced.³⁹ The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.⁴⁰\n## 1.

Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet,⁴² but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)⁴³, establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)⁴⁴ and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)⁴⁵ or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment,⁴⁶ the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber-\n41 Convention on Cybercrime, Council of Europe, CETS No. 185, concluded on 23 November 2001, entered into force on 7 January 2004.\n42 ITU’s Role with regard to International Public Policy Issues Pertaining to the Internet and the Management of Internet Resources, including Domain Names and Addresses: Resolution 102 [Rev.

Self-Regulation in Cyberspace\nIn 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet⁵¹ by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet.⁵² The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994⁵³ and has been tasked with the development of\n47 Http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:0477:FIN (last accessed on 3 April 2017).\n48 For the so-called Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox see: https://www.ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/EU-170607-CyberDiplomacyToolbox.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2017).\n49 European Cybercrime Centre - EC3, https://www.europol.europa.eu/about-europol/european-cybercrime-centre-ec3 (last accessed on 3 April 2017).\n50 Feick/Werle, Regulation of Cyberspace, in: Baldwin/Cave/Lodge (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Regulation, Oxford University Press, 2010.\n51 See Section 1 of the ICANN bylaws as amended in 2017, available online at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/governance/bylaws-en.\n52 See IETF’s website https://www6.ietf.org/ and S.

While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code: \"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the \"protocol language\" and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.\n## III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies\nAlthough the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.\nOn the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to\n54 See generally Lessig, Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace, 1999, The Law of the Horse: What Cyber-law Might Teach, 113 Harvard Law Review 1999, p. 501 ff. and p. 533.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US$^{55}$, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, $^{56}$ have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes$^{57}$ and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.$^{58}$\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n55 See, for example, the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, “Fraud and related activity in connection with computers” (as amended in 2006).\n56 Ibid., § 1030 (a) 2-7.\n57 Cyber Crime, Federal Bureau of Investigation, https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/cyber (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n58 Fact Sheet: Cybersecurity National Plan, The White House Office of the Press Secretary, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/09/fact-sheet-cybersecurity-national-action-plan (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nAbhandlung\nprocesses in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.⁵⁹\nAnother state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems.⁶⁰ Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.⁶¹\nChina is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States.⁶² A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016⁶³ which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.⁶⁴\nThe national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014⁶⁵ and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.⁶⁶\n⁵⁹ According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target.⁶⁸ Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities⁶⁹ will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n⁶⁷ Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\n# D. Perspectives\n## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.⁷⁰\nAlthough not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force).⁷¹ However, as some interventions\n⁷⁰ While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n⁷¹ On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam-\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention⁷² and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to.⁷³ Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.⁷⁴\nIn this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility⁷⁵ hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs⁷⁶ but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organi-\nbridge University Press, 2017.\n72 The customary character of the non-intervention principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, 1986 ICJ Reports 14.\n73 See Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare, Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 7 ff.\n74 See Dunlap, Towards a Cyberspace Legal Regime in the 21 century: Considerations for American Cyber Warriors, Nebraska Law Review 2009, pp. 712 ff.\n75 As codified in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n76 Ibid., Art. 4.\nZLW 67.

This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78\nSo far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80\nIn the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable.

Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations$^{82}$ and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols$^{83}$ meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space\nCyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nAbhandlung\nnecessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects$^{84}$ – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility$^{85}$ one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n## Conclusion\nIn this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n84 On the notion of ‘control’ in space law, see Schmidt-Tedd/Mick, Article VIII, in: Hobe/Schmidt-Tedd/Schrogl (eds.), Cologne Commentary on Space Law (Vol. I), Carl Heymanns, 2009, pp. 57 f.\n85 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\nHobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nIt is obvious that there are more questions than answers as to the legal avenues concerning possible harmful activities originating from cyberspace and that the legal field of cyber law will have to evolve and adapt very dynamically to the rapid and highly complex technical challenges which cyberspace creates.\nThe analysis of the relevant international law, on the one hand, and national laws, on the other, shows that while existing legal concepts may be generally applicable to cyberspace, they do not provide an encompassing framework for its regulation. Nevertheless, they represent some initial basis for specifically tailored legal rules for cyberspace as one of the emerging global domains for human activities which produce effects in all spheres of life on all thinkable levels – from single private daily lives, through big-scale business relations to government activities and state interactions.\nNational regulation of cyberspace is so far the most feasible instrument but as its effectivity on a broader scale is restricted by the limitations of sovereignty as opposed to the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace, probably a coordinated combination of international, regional and national rules may be required. Moreover, for the development of such complex rules the efforts of the traditional lawmakers as incorporated in state legislative powers will have to rely on the vital support of non-governmental entities rooted in cyberspace as they will provide the needed technical and practical understanding of the issues needing regulation.\nThus, summarizing it can be stated that it is rather doubtful at the moment whether regulation of cyberspace can remain a sole governmental exercise. As of yet however, it is unclear when it will become a consolidated multi-actor effort including governments, IGOs, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.\nThe Institute of Air and Space Law has been conducting theoretical research and expanding its expertise on cyber matters since its 90th anniversary in 2015 - in particular through its involvement in projects such as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations and the work of the IISL Working Group on Cyber Law which the Institute's Director had the honor to chair.

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent¹ and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber * Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nattacks. At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\n## A. What is Cyberspace?\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet² determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s³ and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades.⁴ Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.⁵ The interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”.⁶ Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater,⁷ will circumscribe cyberspace as follows: ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"It is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word\"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices¹¹ has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space,¹² interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network¹³ results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n## I. Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats The main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n### 1. Technical Factors The technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels.

Jg. 2/2018 [257] --- ¹¹ At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n¹² Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n¹³ Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.\nAbhandlung thermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced.¹⁴ This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017,¹⁵ which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing.¹⁶ Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006,¹⁷ while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\nNot in the last place, apart from the\"surface web\"or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden\"Deep Web\"not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.¹⁸ ## 2. Regulatory Factors The regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nlaw and governance to keep up with the pace of the technological development. As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts¹⁹ may be applied. At the same time, sovereignty and national security interests are a hurdle for an encompassing international mechanism to address cyber threats which, as will be demonstrated in the next section, are constantly evolving in scope and complexity.\n## II. Statistics on Cyber Threats The occurrence of malicious cyber activities has been growing in the past few years. According to statistical data, almost 30% of all malware appeared in 2015.²⁰ In Europe, as of 2017, the statistics on cyber incidents show that in some member states, 50% of all crimes committed are cyber crimes and that security incidents across all industries has increased by 38% — as never seen before —+ in 2015.²¹ Furthermore, 80% of European companies experienced at least one cybersecurity incident in 2016.²² On the global scale as of January 2018, malware was the main ‘contributor’ to cyber attacks, causing nearly 44% of all attacks while account hijacking caused approximately 15% and the rest of cyber attacks were distributed between malicious scripts, malicious browser extensions, DNS hijacking, etc.²³ The largest portion of cyber attacks (82%) were made up of cyber crimes, 12.2% of cyber espionage, 4.3% of cyber ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung warfare and 1,7% of so-called “hacktivism” – an activism in the Internet aiming at promoting political or social agendas.\nIn the timeline of cyber attacks, a few major incidents have gained wide attention. The 'Stuxnet' case became known in 2010 after a cyber weapon addressed at Iran's Nuclear program accessed parts of the control and data systems and caused damage to nuclear centrifuges.²⁴ Further cyber attacks against states have occurred, for example, in 2007 when Estonian institutions were targeted, in 2008 in the USA a cyber attack took place when a breach in the military system was effected through an infected USB flash drive; in South Korea and the United States incidents were recorded in 2009, when thousands of computers were “hijacked” in order to cause data traffic congestion; in Singapore in 2013 several attacks occurred with the aim to protest against censorship, among others.\nMore recently, it has been reported that a cyber attack possibly originating from Russia might have influenced the outcome of the 2017 presidential elections in the USA²⁵ and the computer network of the German foreign ministry and the German government in general had suffered a continuing, ongoing 'powerful cyber attack' which lead to loss of sensitive information while the exact consequences of the security breach could not yet be estimated.²⁶ This shows that cyberspace is an arena not only for economic purposes²⁷, but also for political sabotage and subversion and that states have become one of the main targets of cyber crime.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nFurthermore, new forms of malware designed specifically to target infrastructure have been discovered which could lead to cyber attacks to power plants, electricity supplying chains, transportation control systems and further critical infrastructure.²⁸ Summarizing, the vast harmful potential of the misuse of cyberspace has become evident and it needs to be addressed both on the factual control level through preventive technical mechanisms, but also on the regulatory level. In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n## C. Is there Law in Cyberspace? Who Exercises Jurisdiction?\nWhat has so far been unknown for global commons - namely private-based, state-detached self-regulation and governance - seems to be the preferred, and so far the most advanced approach to regulate cyberspace.²⁹ In fact, apart from the lack of sovereignty as common denominator, there are no other major common legal characteristics of cyberspace and the three global commons outer space, Antarctica and the high seas. While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung # I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace If one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle.³⁰ However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors.³¹ However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ntual difficulties therefore, through attributability, international law remains an option and\"playground\"for cyberspace regulation.\nThis is not to say that international law makes national regulation obsolete. However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation Sovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle,³² or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.³³ # 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace Despite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance³⁴ difficult in practice.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung First, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders.³⁵ Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web. The aim was to provide a space where a community of persons could interact globally through a ‘universal language’ of Internet protocols. This is also one of the reasons why already during its early development of the Internet, its security and protection were not built in a way which would the evolution and use of the Internet,” Report from the Working Group on Internet Governance, Document WSIS-II7PC-3/DOC/5-E, 3 August 2005. Thus, governance can be understood as a collective term for all regulatory and enforcement mechanisms aiming at establishing a regime of use of cyberspace. R. O. Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes. See also Mayntz, The Changing Governance of Large Technical Infrastructure Systems, in: Mayntz (ed.), Über Governance: Institutionen und Prozesse Politischer Regelung, Campus, 2009, pp. 121 ff.\n³⁵ On the global validity of IP addresses, domain names, and Internet standards, see Bendrath/Hofmann/Leib/Mayer/Zürn, Governing the Internet: The Quest for Legitimacy and Effective Rules, in: Hurrelmann/Leibfried/Martens/Mayer (eds.), Transforming the Golden-Age Nation State, Palgrave Macmillan, 2007.\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nstimulate or enhance the imposing of regulatory restrictions and laws over the virtual domain.\nThis does not, however, mean that no regulatory approach to activities in the Internet could be followed³⁶ or that there is a full legal vacuum with regard to cyberspace. Some legal instruments exist which shape the legality of action in cyberspace. Most of them are concerned with the contents and data as well as the privacy of data transmitted through the Internet and will be outlined below.\n## II. Existing Regulatory and Governance Concepts for Cyberspace During the years in which the virtual domain evolved into an integral part of life, different phases of regulation in cyberspace could be observed.³⁷ At first, a regulatory-free era of enthusiasm (during the 1990s) was building upon the fact that a truly global domain for communication had been created and that data exchange should be free from state control in order to be available for everybody with access to the needed computer periphery.³⁸ This was followed by a phase around the first decade of the new millennium which promulgated cyberspace to be, a global, common, sovereignty-free space. During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced.³⁹ The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.⁴⁰ ## 1. International and Regional Regulatory Attempts So far, states have not come to an agreement on international cyberspace governance. Apart from the only binding international instrument on cybercrime, the 2001 Bu ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung dapest Convention,⁴¹ an international regulatory framework for cyber activities does not yet exist. Indeed, the International Telecommunications Union has recognized its competence in questions pertaining to the Internet,⁴² but as a complex intergovernmental organization, it cannot react quickly to the challenges of cyberspace.\nIn the European Union, the EU Commission has initiated in 2017 a “cybersecurity package” to regulate the data flow in the Union. This package will involve series of measures, for example for the strengthening of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA)⁴³, establishing a framework for cybersecurity certification and re-modelling existing instruments, e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)⁴⁴ and the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)⁴⁵ or creating new ones, e.g. the proposal for a Directive on the Combatting of Fraud and Counterfeiting of Non-cash Means of Payment,⁴⁶ the proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on ENISA, the “EU Cybersecurity Agency”, and repealing Regulation (EU) 526/2013, and on Information and Communication Technology Cybersecurity Certification (“Cyber- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsecurity Act\")⁴⁷ and a Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities.⁴⁸ Furthermore, Europol has been tasked with the harmonization of national cybercrime laws and established a European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in 2013 to “strengthen the law enforcement response to cybercrime in the EU and thus to help protect European citizens, businesses and governments from online crime”.⁴⁹ However, the regulation of cyberspace as a technical infrastructure and condition for transmission of content which should aim at shaping the general opportunities and constraints of utilising the Internet is not that well developed and is predominantly existing on the basis of private self-regulation.⁵⁰ ## 2. Self-Regulation in Cyberspace In 1998, the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) consisting of private and public members was founded with the aim to ensure the stable and secure operation of the Internet⁵¹ by providing maintenance, ensuring stability, resilience and security and exercises far-reaching technical competencies on the architecture of the Internet, the internet domains and internet protocols. Moreover, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been founded in 1986 as a voluntary organization in which technical proposals are being developed for the “design, use and management” of the Internet.⁵² The World Wide Web Consortium (known as W3C) was founded in 1994⁵³ and has been tasked with the development of ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung standards for the world wide web. While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code:\"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes. However, as the\"protocol language\"and the technical structure of the Internet are of a global design, the question must be asked on how this global code can be sufficiently comprehended by regulation.\n## III. The Role of Governments in Cybersecurity: Examples of National Cyber Strategies Although the limitations to enforcement powers are bound to the territorial element of jurisdiction and thus pose challenges to the regulation of the cyberspace, in the moment it is mostly states which have the economic capacities to encourage the development of cybersecurity mechanisms and, in particular, to impose regulations for cyberspace.\nOn the national level, the general 'checklist' for protection against cyber threats includes the implementation of security policies, the imposition of restrictions on computer systems and the use of sophisticated anti-virus software and encryption of data.\nThis is where cybersecurity, as opposed to malicious cyber activities, plays a significant role: while tracking and prosecuting perpetrators can, most probably, not lead to ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nsuccess, the prevention may contribute more substantively to diminish cyber threats and minimize their consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity as a domain addressing the protection from cyber threats and malicious cyber activities has been recognized as one of the crucial and central challenges for governments and society in the 21st century. States are establishing defense centers and strategies against cyber attacks in close cooperation with police and national secret services, but also with the help of non-governmental entities and the private industry, in order to enhance knowledge and, above all, to develop capacities for timely and adequate reaction against malicious cyber activities.\nFurthermore, states can also require from their public and private entities to stick to certain standards. These instruments mainly address the content regulation, including data privacy, data protection, protection of intellectual property rights, economic transactions, illegal content and conduct and are included in national policies, laws and procedures.\nFor example in the US, laws criminalizing the unauthorized access and transmission of malware into computers, computer espionage, committing fraud with a computer at accessing, among others, private information without authorization, have been introduced already in the 1980s.\nIn 2002 a special division in the FBI was established to investigate cybercrimes and a Cybersecurity National Action Plan was established under President Obama in 2016.\nAgain in 2016, the New York Department of Financial Services made a proposal for a Cybersecurity Regulation to protect consumers and financial institutions from cyber attacks which requires that financial services companies put risk assessments and ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung processes in place for employees to use and follow and that firms report on attempted data breach.⁵⁹ Another state which has introduced cybersecurity strategy is Canada. Its national strategy aims at encouraging cooperation between the private and public sector for strengthening awareness about cybersecurity and enhancing the protection and elimination of gaps in the security of cyber systems.⁶⁰ Cyber incidents of national significance are addressed by the Canadian Cyber Incidence Response Centre and the Government Response Centre.⁶¹ China is considered to be one of the countries with well-developed cyber capabilities which can also be used in hostile activities against other States.⁶² A Chinese national cybersecurity strategy was made public in 2016⁶³ which is governed by a national Cyberspace Administration.⁶⁴ The national cybersecurity strategy of Japan confirms that cyber crimes should be handled as crimes in physical space and subjects cyberspace to domestic legislation. These efforts are enhanced by the Cyber Security Basic Act of 2014⁶⁵ and the established National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cyber Security.⁶⁶ ⁵⁹ According to a press release from Sept. 13, 2016, http://www.dfs.ny.gov/about/press/pr1609131.htm.

Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nAlso the Russian Federation which along with China and the USA is considered to dispose of vast cyber capacities, has enacted a national strategy originally incorporated in the 2000 Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation which was updated in 2016.⁶⁷ In sum, states play a significant role in establishing some regulatory framework to ensure better cybersecurity. They are also responsible for private persons and their exposure to cyber threats. While every user should be aware that internet activity means also personal responsibility regarding the sharing and uploading of data, the average person cannot be considered prepared for sophisticated malicious cyber activities. This is even more so, since personal computers are an easy target.⁶⁸ Therefore, it is part of the role of states as sovereigns to protect the interests of their nationals and enhance domestic mechanisms and develop defensive strategies.\nObviously, the traditional basis for sovereignty based on territory would fail to provide sufficient control possibilities to states over cyber activities. Moreover, the anonymity of cyber activities⁶⁹ will remain an obstacle for any attribution. While existing regulatory and governance efforts are still not comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively counteract malicious cyber activities, it can be expected that national efforts will be increasingly concentrated to develop them and may become the basis for a future more encompassing cyber regulation.\n⁶⁷ Doctrine of Information Security of the Russian Federation, approved by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 646 of December 5, 2016.

Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung # D. Perspectives ## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.⁷⁰ Although not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force).⁷¹ However, as some interventions ⁷⁰ While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n⁷¹ On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention⁷² and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to.⁷³ Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.⁷⁴ In this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility⁷⁵ hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs⁷⁶ but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organibridge University Press, 2017.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung zation or providing equipment to persons carrying out the conduct.77 Particularly in virtual space, however, evidence thereof may be very difficult to demonstrate.\nTherefore, it should be considered whether or not a malicious cyber activity which has been identified to originally come from the territory of a particular state must be attributed to the state whether or not the action came from a de jure governmental organ or from a de facto organ, when the state has provided considerable support in the form of planning, coordination and organisation of the activity. This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78 So far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80 In the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict. If positive, then for such activities based in or originating from cyberspace, ius in bello would be applicable. Such application of international humanitar- ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space Cyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung necessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n## Conclusion In this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n\nZLW 67.

Cyber law will thus be defined as the law relevant in cyberspace. Thereby it must be highlighted that currently, in the discussion of the main concern of cyber law – namely the protection from malicious uses of cyberspace – a rather heterogeneous terminology is used. While the notion of 'cyber attack' is most often used as a counterpart to cybersecurity, this is not an encompassing term for all types of malicious cyber activities. They range from mere threats to concrete intrusions, including 'cyber vandalism', 'cyber terrorism' and also cyber warfare. While the exact differentiation between the nuances of these single notions may not be possible to the most detailed extent¹ and inconsistency in the use of terms regarding malicious cyber acts can be observed in the literature, there is a common denominator: such acts can be defined by the intentional making use of cyberspace for malicious purposes, aimed at causing harm or at least at threatening to cause harm.\nIn the following, first a circumscription of cyberspace as a domain for human activities shall be made before the question of the respective cyber law is addressed. Obviously, this question must be approached by looking at the existing law. Particularly in view of threats for governments and enterprises resulting from malicious cyber activities questions of analogies to existing public international law will be discussed. This shall finally allow for an assessment where we stand with cyber law, which will most certainly represent an extremely relevant part of the law in the future. This already elucidates from the mere fact that particularly armies but also public and private employers award a lot of financial resources for the adequate protection against cyber * Director, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\n** Senior research associate and PhD Candidate, Institute of Air and Space Law, University of Cologne.\nZLW 67.

At the end, the case will be made for the necessity of future research on cyber law for which the Institute of Air and Space Law seems to be well equipped.\nModern information technologies and in particular the Internet² determine our daily life. Almost all daily activities use, depend on or at least relate to the global domain of the world wide web (www). The Internet was originally launched as an experimental military communication platform in the 1960s³ and has taken up an exorbitant importance on a global scale during the past two decades.⁴ Since then, not only has the world wide web taken up a role in almost all aspects of modern life, but it also shapes the way modern societies function. Especially Internet-based communication has reached a level of accessibility and pace never experienced before.⁵ The interconnectivity of private persons, of governmental and non-governmental entities, and also of States, opens a new domain for interaction, but also for malicious activities. And this domain has the characteristic of transcending national boundaries.\nAs early as the 1980s William Gibson introduced the word ‘cyberspace’ in his novel “Neuromancer”.⁶ Later another pioneer of cyberspace activities, Don Slater,⁷ will circumscribe cyberspace as follows: ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Abhandlung\"The sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication [...]. It exists entirely within the computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\"It is important to understand that although the notion 'cyberspace' uses the word\"space\", it does not depict a natural, physical space as we are used to, for example, to denominate the international commons outer space, Antarctica or the high seas. Rather, cyberspace is a completely man-made realm which is founded and dependent on a technological basis – a global system comprising of interconnected, interoperable host and server computer systems which can communicate through a unified network based on uniformly defined protocols. In this regard, cyberspace is a non-physical realm using the physical infrastructure of computer networks and the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHereby it is, first of all, important to understand that this virtual domain has left the traditional understanding of dimension and space. Cyberspace is nothing that is part of the visible perception of modern States as defined by territory, population and jurisdiction. Rather, on the basis of computer networks as the technical prerequisite, cyberspace has been created as a global virtual reality. Therefore, cyberspace is a man-made social construction, which reflects life in an un-bodily way.\nNevertheless, this virtual space may also produce non-virtual effects. By offering a platform for communication, cyberspace allows for a multiplicity of social possible human interaction and its factual implications. Be it with online communication, games, be it with e-mails or conferences, be it with financial transactions via Internet, be it also with malicious action like fraud or phishing, there is this new social reality whose essence takes place through the cyberspace. Nevertheless, the effects of cyber activities are not restricted only to the virtual space as they produce effects in social relations. In this sense, cyberspace cannot be separated from real life. Today, the ZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018 Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\ngrowing dependence on cyberspace and interconnected devices¹¹ has transcended the mere use for work and has evolved into a symbiosis of private life, physical space and interaction which cannot be unlinked anymore.\n## B. Which Dangers Exist in Cyberspace?\nWhile the original idea of the Internet was to create a free, open and transparent space,¹² interoperability and interconnectivity mean also unhindered accessibility. The virtual character of data and information transmitted through a fragmented global network¹³ results in a vulnerability which opens a broad range of avenues for malicious activities. The dangers in cyberspace are complex and may affect various levels of private, governmental and international activities. Thus, the scope and outcome of malicious cyber activities may vary from restricted to only one computer or one computer system to multiple networks.\nSuch acts can be, for example, the intentional acquisition of access (espionage) to and modification of data (e.g. through various types of computer malware). Such manipulation can lead, among many other things, to money transfers, bank heists, stealing of personal data, intrusion in privacy or dissemination of fake news online. It can also disrupt elections or even allow for access not only to corporate, but also governmental infrastructure deploying security and necessary resources (such as, for example, electricity, energy, water and communications).\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nZLW 67.

Factors Contributing to the Complexity of Cyber Threats\n\nThe main reasons for the vulnerability of the virtual domain which characterize the complexity of cyber threats can be divided in two types: technical and regulatory.\n\n### 1. Technical Factors\n\nThe technical factors include the de-centralized structure of cyberspace which offers interconnectivity between networks all around the world and which because of its openness is a condition for innovation but also a reason for low security levels. Fur-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018\n[257]\n\n---\n\n¹¹ At least in the parts of the world in which access to the Internet is part of the basic infrastructure.\n\n¹² Martinez, The Legal Dimensions of Cyber-Conflict with Regard to Large Satellite Infrastructures and Constellations, paper presented at the 67th IAC, 26-30 September 2016 in Guadalajara, Mexico, p. 2.\n\n¹³ Force Hill, Internet Fragmentation: Highlighting the Major Technical, Governance and Diplomatic Challenges for U.S. Policy Makers, 2012, p. 31.",
    "Abhandlung\n\nthermore, there is a lack of originally integrated, standardized protection mechanisms and as no system is fully isolated and secure, comprehensive protection from malicious cyber activities cannot be fully achieved. Also, through the constant production of new software codes, new vulnerabilities are constantly introduced.¹⁴ This means that even for well-protected governmental networks cyber risks cannot be completely eliminated. Moreover, locating the origin of a cyber attack is not always possible; even more difficult is to determine who initiated it – thus, a response and prosecution of the perpetrator may not be feasible.\n\nThe risk of technical nature is further aggravated by the fact that the role and use of cyberspace are constantly growing: Almost one half of the world's population was using the Internet in 2017,¹⁵ which is an increase of almost 50% in comparison to 2015. This means that the amount of digital data stored in the virtual domain (big data, cloud computing) and the number of websites are growing.¹⁶ Furthermore, it is expected that the number of smart devices communicating wirelessly will have reached 200 bio. until 2020, in comparison to 2 bio. In 2006,¹⁷ while more and more devices (mobile phones, tablets, lap tops), household appliances, transportation vehicles and also implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc.) are being produced with built-in wireless technology. This means that basically any person and any household could be hacked.\n\nNot in the last place, apart from the \"surface web\" or the cyberspace used by the average users, there is a hidden \"Deep Web\" not indexed or accessible through the search engines which is used for criminal activities and has been reported to be up to 5000 times larger than the surface web.¹⁸\n\n## 2. Regulatory Factors\n\nThe regulatory factors contributing to the complex dangers in cyberspace include the lack of an encompassing legal framework for cyberspace as well as the difficulties for\n\nZLW 67.

As attribution may be difficult to assign, it is extremely challenging to sanction an assumed perpetrator. It may in this context very well be considered on whether the rules of attributability as laid down in the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts¹⁹ may be applied.

In order to determine whether this harmful potential has been addressed adequately from a legal perspective, the question must be asked whether legal rules for malicious cyber activities can be extrapolated from existing legal regimes and, as concerns state powers to regulate over cyberspace, whether the traditional understanding of sovereignty and jurisdiction are applicable to cyberspace.\n\n## C.

While all global commons are not man-made and are regulated by an international regime, cyberspace is related to them through its sovereignty-free global character. However, this partial parallel does not solve the main challenge posed by the specific nature of cyberspace: What kind of law is applicable to cyberspace and does a specific cyber (legal) order have to be established?\n\nIn order to assess which laws should be applicable to cyberspace, it is important to clarify whether sovereign states through their national laws or the international community through international law can offer an adequate regulation over the virtual realm.\n\nZLW 67.

    "Abhandlung\n\n# I. Applicability of Jurisdiction and Sovereignty in Cyberspace\n\nIf one asks the question on which law shall be applicable in cyberspace a fundamental problem becomes evident: as we have seen from the above, cyberspace is a virtual space and does not have a reliable territorial link. However, all traditional fields of law are built on the basis of territoriality or at least on the basis of a link to a territory. The sovereignty of states still exists with regard to its principal prescriptive jurisdiction, based on the passive personality principle and the protective principle.³⁰ However, concrete regulatory and enforcement capabilities become difficult to effectuate as well as it becomes difficult to attribute criminal acts in cyberspace to persons and states. Therefore, there is currently no encompassing legal basis for regulating cyber defense effectively so as to cover most of cyber threats.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a need for conflict prevention even in cyberspace. Rules are needed which help to avoid or regulate conflicts. And if look is taken into the substance of public international law, it has the quality of being applicable beyond national boundaries and has a regulatory function for the entire international community. Moreover, in more recent times, international law has been regulating conflicts even with non-state actors.³¹ However, it is only applicable as much as its main actors – States – bestow it applicability through accepting obligations thereunder.\n\nConflict avoidance in international law is possible through the formulation of general rules and could serve to generate rules also for cyberspace, including the integration of non-state actors.\n\nAlthough cyberspace is a medium without a ‘solid’ territorial origin, it functions on the basis of exchange of signals and data between information-emitting sources which are usually located in a physical space and are thus usually rooted in some state’s territory or at least related to an element of sovereignty through attributability to territory or persons. Thus, the source of the digital information may be related to the element of sovereignty by way of attributing it to a location or to persons and despite the fac\n\nZLW 67.

However, the ubiquitous character of cyberspace requires that international rules are created.\n\n# 1. The Role of Sovereign Enforcement Powers for Cyber Regulation\n\nSovereignty, as an independence from other (equal) states, finds an expression in the legal enforcement power of states – their jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is thus the sovereign power of states to lawfully enact and enforce laws in their territory and to persons and objects thereunder, and to control the conduct of their national natural and judicial persons and, under certain conditions, to persons on their territory. Thus, first, the physical cyber infrastructure situated on the territory of a State falls under its jurisdiction, second, it is in principle possible for states to exercise jurisdiction over computer networks and third, the virtual character of cyberspace does not exclude the existence of jurisdiction of states.\n\nParticularly the granting of protection and security is one of the main sources of legitimacy of the modern state and a consequence of its sovereignty. The so-called protective principle,³² or the principle of international criminal jurisdiction, allow States to confer their legal power extraterritorial effect, e.g. for imposing legislation related to vital security interests. Thus, the protection of governmental functions of sovereign States requires that a state retains its functions and is able to apply its jurisdiction also to foreign persons outside its territory.³³\n\n# 2. Challenges for the Exercise of Sovereignty in Cyberspace\n\nDespite the relevance of the protective principle to cyberspace, the decentralized structure as well as the overarching and pluralistic technical nature of the Internet and cyberspace, makes the exercise of jurisdiction and governance³⁴ difficult in practice.\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018",
    "Abhandlung\n\nFirst, cyberspace is not restricted to territory and borders.³⁵ Any activity undertaken in or through cyber means could have implications in any part of the world and cross through and affect multiple jurisdictions. Thus, in cases of malicious cyber activities, the nationality principle, as one of the main pillars to determine the jurisdiction of a State, would most probably fail for the determination of legal consequences for perpetrators.\n\nSecond, this means that as cyber activities can take place under any jurisdiction, it is rather difficult to exclude states whose cyber infrastructure has been used or whose nationals may have been involved in malicious cyber activities, from claims of other states.\n\nThird, not only the allocation of a certain virtual to a jurisdiction, but also the attribution of a cyber act to a person or entity is problematic. The technical architecture of cyberspace allows for hackers to log into accounts and to ‘simulate’ attributability to non-involved actors. At the same time, although it is rather unfeasible to track down a cyber activity to its original source, aiming for some protection against malicious acts is not impossible and could lower vulnerability.\n\nIn the dawn of the modern Internet age, the open and transparent access to the Internet built the basis for the world wide web.

Keohane observes in his book “Power and Governance in a Partially Globalized World” (2002) that governance and traditional international law can be seen as two contrasting forms: while international law is focused on stable structures, governance is characterized by the regulation of dynamic processes.

During the next phase the need for (some) regulation was recognized, but the approach of the minimum regulatory interventions was advanced.³⁹ The current efforts for regulation in cyberspace could be characterized by the fact that the global perception of cyberspace has put a stress to the awareness about cybersecurity as one of the most complex challenges of present times.⁴⁰\n\n## 1.

While these organizations are not the only ones, the evolution of their role as major stakeholders in the non-governmental regulation of cyberspace exemplifies the trend of setting standards for cyberspace without a direct involvement of States and State jurisdiction.\n\nIt has many times been argued that governance and law in cyberspace can only exist on the basis of the internet code: \"Code is law\".54 This implies that it is the technical foundation, the architecture of cyberspace as built upon software and hardware code which defines the options to exercise governance and to regulate in this domain. The code, as the defining value for the way the Internet works also prescribes the possibilities to utilize it, similarly to the legal system of a State which delineates what is permissible under law and where unlawfulness starts, may be used for establishing rules in this virtual domain.\n\nIf the technical code establishes both the basis and the possible boundaries of regulation in cyberspace, then regulators need deep understanding and expertise for the possibilities it shapes.

    "Abhandlung\n\n# D. Perspectives\n\n## I. Is the Westphalian System of International Law Equipped to Appropriately React Against Dangers from Cyberspace?\n\nIn the Westphalian paradigm, the system of international law is characterized by the fact that States as the primary subjects of international law govern the balance and relations among themselves on the premise of sovereignty, equality and under the principle of non-intervention.\n\nIn the present and probably even more so in the future, the amalgam between activities in the physical and virtual space will constantly put traditional legal models to a test as they might not be effective enough to react to new phenomena, characterized strongly by technology and crossing the borders of traditional legal models. Nevertheless, a look into the applicable international law to cyberspace might provide some answers to pertinent issues such as whether malicious cyber activities can be attributed to states; whether the UN Charter is applicable to malicious cyber activities and whether and under which conditions *ius in bello* and humanitarian law are applicable to cyber warfare.⁷⁰\n\nAlthough not any malicious cyber activity should automatically be qualified as an “attack” and other levels of intrusion (threat, vandalism, sabotage) are possible, such acts can generally be defined as any offensive, malicious activity using the cyberspace to ‘hack’ and cause harm. Here, various forms of harm are possible – from the stealing of data through modification of information to the gaining of factual control over cyber based systems and infrastructure. Such acts can take the scope of an intervention into the internal affairs of states. It is not yet clear whether and in how far malicious cyber activities fall under the applicability of international law regulating conflicts (e.g. whether a cyber attack can constitute use of force).⁷¹ However, as some interventions\n\n⁷⁰ While so far no event has been qualified as a “cyber war”, the occurrence of events such as the 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia which led to the compromising of government communications through the use of botnets as well as the use of cyber attacks in the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia have been analysed as possibly reaching the level of military actions as the functioning of significant state-related infrastructure and civil society were disrupted. See for example Schackelford, Managing Cyber Attacks in International Law, Business, and Relations: In Search of Cyber Peace, Cambridge University Press, 2014, pp. 162-171.\n\n⁷¹ On the discussion on whether cyber attacks can violate the prohibition on the use of force, see Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations, Cam-\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018",
    "Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\n\nmight be combined with a certain element of force or a physical effect, one may argue that these cases constitute a violation of the prohibition of intervention⁷² and that certain cyber ‘attacks’ can indeed amount to the use of force in the sense of Art. 2 (4) of the UN Charter.\n\nTo illustrate, if, for example, a cyber activity is aimed at and does actually infringe on the infrastructure of other countries thereby causing bodily injury or death, it does not seem very problematic to correlate the consequences caused through the use of cyberspace to what an armed attack as violation of the use of force principle may amount to.⁷³ Therefore, such cyber attacks may well qualify to the use of self-defense of states under Art. 51 of the UN Charter. Nevertheless, for such a deduction, one must probably pose as an indispensable legal condition thereby that the outcome of a cyber attack must be equivalent to a kinetic attack in its physical effects.⁷⁴\n\nIn this respect it may be questionable whether one can state the occurrence of an armed attack by another state if the activity in cyberspace was not determined by a government but by a non-state actor. In principle, the rules of state responsibility⁷⁵ hold that states can be held responsible for wrongful acts of their organs⁷⁶ but not of private persons, unless the conduct has been directed or controlled by the state. According to the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, to invoke state responsibility, a link must be given between the State and a certain conduct so as it can be considered its own. This can be established, for example, through so-called effective-control of the State over the acting persons, e.g. through financing, organi-\n\nbridge University Press, 2017.\n72 The customary character of the non-intervention principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

This would then amount to an 'overall control' test such as has been applied by the International Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia to the Tadic case for armed groups.78\n\nSo far, cyberspace has not been used as an arena or inter-state disputes equal to an armed conflict, but it has become an arena of inter-state espionage: accusations have been exchanged officially between China, Russia and the USA79 and the Snowden case gained popularity after a CIA employee who disclosed sensitive information from the US National Security Agency has been faced with espionage charges while being granted asylum in Russia.80\n\nIn the light of growing tension and conflict potential on a large scale, it may moreover be questionable whether cyberspace can become an arena of inter-state confrontation in the form of a cyber war81 and whether hostile activities in cyberspace can equal an armed conflict.

    "Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\n\nian law, inscribed in the 1907 Hague Regulations$^{82}$ and the Geneva Conventions with Protocols$^{83}$ meets fundamental problems. These problems become apparent under consideration of the fact that the prime aim of international humanitarian law, based on these conventions, is the separation of combatants and non-combatants with the aim to guarantee a minimum of humanitarian standards, including regulations on the admissibility of conduct and targets. In thinkable cases of cyber warfare one will hardly be able to identify the sources of an attack and it would be even more difficult, if not impossible, to make a clear cut between combatants and non-combatants.\n\nThe search in the system of traditional international law for solutions applicable to the virtual domain may not provide with final and ready-to-hand answers. This new phenomenon, distinctively characterized by its technical nature, presupposes an adaptation of existing concepts and possibly also the creation of new models to react to the extensive challenges it creates.\n\n## II. Possible Areas of Research in the Future: Cybersecurity in Space\n\nCyberspace produces multifold challenges for our societies in various spheres of life. They range from threats to personal cybersecurity to targeting against private and public entities and even states. As any location and field of activities can be targeted with a harmful intent via cyberspace, dangers may exist not only on national territories, but also in international domains such as airspace and outer space. For example, a malicious cyber activity may be addressed at communication lines serving the guidance and control of airplanes and space objects. It is therefore of fundamental importance that means to facilitate and protect are addressed also in the practice of the respective specific fields, here: in aviation and space. This is true also for other branches of law regulating global and critical infrastructure, such as e.g. energy and transportation law.\n\nAs critical infrastructure depends also on outer space, space assets can be seen as an example in the wider context of cyber vulnerability. Thus, with regard to specific problems derived from cyberspace and relevant in space law, an understanding is\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018",
    "Abhandlung\n\nnecessary for the technical architecture of cyberspace as a possible origin of harmful action; for the question on whether one should define the scope of legal rules for cyberspace as a specific self-contained regime as well as who the potential regulators of cyberspace should be. Furthermore, the question is at stake on whether space law is or will partly be applicable to cyber activities in outer space and what the legal aspects of cybersecurity for space assets could be.\n\nFinally, the possibilities for attribution of malicious cyber activities addressed to governmental or non-governmental actors must be taken up in the center of the research since it seems that current criteria of attributability – overall control or effective control over space objects$^{84}$ – may not be entirely sufficient to cover these problems. Because there is a high likelihood that the employment of attribution will not work to detect the origin and the perpetrators of an attack, the prevention and defense against cyber attacks should be a duty of every state. Perhaps the only possibility to apply rules of attribution is to work with assumptions. Thereby one assumption is difficult to make. Unlike Art. 7 of the 2001 ILC Rules on State Responsibility$^{85}$ one cannot assume that the territory from which a danger originates, gives rise to any kind of assumption if the danger is acquired by private persons – only with the clear evidence of some kind of authorship the burden of proof is shifted to the presumed perpetrator. That means that in principle all efforts must be put into a thorough defense against cyber attacks, since there is unfortunately a high likelihood that neither can attribution take place, nor can the damages be compensated.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article the attempt was made to sketch out the characteristics of cyberspace and its legal regulation. It has become apparent that at the moment, only little regulation in this challenging field exists or can be directly derived from existing concepts of international law. At the same time, such well-known concepts such as attributability and sovereign powers of states, are not offering promising results in the specific realm of cyberspace.\n\n84 On the notion of ‘control’ in space law, see Schmidt-Tedd/Mick, Article VIII, in: Hobe/Schmidt-Tedd/Schrogl (eds.), Cologne Commentary on Space Law (Vol. I), Carl Heymanns, 2009, pp. 57 f.\n\n85 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, International Law Commission, November 2001, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), available with commentaries at: http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf (last accessed on 3 April 2018).\n\nZLW 67. Jg. 2/2018",
    "Hobe/Popova - Law in Cyberspace?\n\nIt is obvious that there are more questions than answers as to the legal avenues concerning possible harmful activities originating from cyberspace and that the legal field of cyber law will have to evolve and adapt very dynamically to the rapid and highly complex technical challenges which cyberspace creates.\n\nThe analysis of the relevant international law, on the one hand, and national laws, on the other, shows that while existing legal concepts may be generally applicable to cyberspace, they do not provide an encompassing framework for its regulation. Nevertheless, they represent some initial basis for specifically tailored legal rules for cyberspace as one of the emerging global domains for human activities which produce effects in all spheres of life on all thinkable levels – from single private daily lives, through big-scale business relations to government activities and state interactions.\n\nNational regulation of cyberspace is so far the most feasible instrument but as its effectivity on a broader scale is restricted by the limitations of sovereignty as opposed to the ubiquitous nature of cyberspace, probably a coordinated combination of international, regional and national rules may be required. Moreover, for the development of such complex rules the efforts of the traditional lawmakers as incorporated in state legislative powers will have to rely on the vital support of non-governmental entities rooted in cyberspace as they will provide the needed technical and practical understanding of the issues needing regulation.\n\nThus, summarizing it can be stated that it is rather doubtful at the moment whether regulation of cyberspace can remain a sole governmental exercise. As of yet however, it is unclear when it will become a consolidated multi-actor effort including governments, IGOs, non-governmental organizations and the private sector.\n\nThe Institute of Air and Space Law has been conducting theoretical research and expanding its expertise on cyber matters since its 90th anniversary in 2015 - in particular through its involvement in projects such as the Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations and the work of the IISL Working Group on Cyber Law[86] which the Institute's Director had the honor to chair.
