This joint attribution builds on commitments made in June summits with NATO, the G7, the EU, and the United Kingdom, and is consistent with the Biden administration's multilateral approach to confronting cybersecurity threats and China more generally. Still, critics question whether the administration's efforts will succeed in altering the behavior of states that pose cybersecurity threats to the United States.\nOver the past few years, the United States has repeatedly accused China of responsibility for cyber intrusions, beginning with a focus on intellectual property theft. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted five members of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) for stealing trade secrets from six U.S. companies including Westinghouse, Alcoa, and U.S. Steel.¹ Later that year, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a deal to refrain from \"conduct[ing] or knowingly support[ing] cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property . . . for commercial advantage\" and to \"promote international rules of the road for appropriate conduct in cyberspace.\"² But the United States has repeatedly accused China of violating that deal,³ as detailed in indictments of various Chinese government-linked hackers for compromises of the Equifax credit reporting agency,⁴ health insurer Anthem,⁵ and hundreds of individual, corporate, and government victims.⁶\n¹ U.S. Dep't of Justice Press Release, U.S. Charges Five Chinese Military Hackers for Cyber Espionage Against U.S. Corporations and a Labor Organization for Commercial Advantage (May 19, 2014), at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-charges-five-chinese-military-hackers-cyber-espionage-against-us-corporations-and-labor [https://perma.cc/B72Q-999Q].\n² Barack Obama, The President's News Conference with President Xi Jinping of China, 2015 DAILY COMP.

The operation terminated hackers' access to the systems, but did not remove any malware that had already been downloaded.\nThen on July 19, the United States joined with the EU, NATO, and other allied countries to attribute the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and to call out China for “foster[ing] an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide.” The White House “[a]ttribut[ed] with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with [the People's Republic of China's (PRC)] MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.” Furthermore, the United States noted:“[H]ackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.”\n> In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.\nThe White House declared that “[t]he PRC's pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world.”\nIn a separate statement, the State Department explained:“Apart from the PRC's direct commitments not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, the international community has laid out clear expectations and guidelines for what constitutes responsible behavior in cyberspace. Responsible states do not indiscriminately compromise global network security nor knowingly harbor cyber criminals—let alone sponsor or collaborate with them. These contract hackers cost governments and businesses billions of dollars in stolen intellectual property, ransom payments, and cybersecurity mitigation efforts, all while the MSS had them on its payroll.”\nMarking its first public attribution of malicious cyber activities to China, NATO announced:\n> U.S. Dep't of Justice Press Release, Justice Department Announces Court-Authorized Effort to Disrupt Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities (Apr. 13, 2021), at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft-exchange [https://perma.cc/9XBK-M5G7].\n>\n> 19 Id.\n>\n> 20 White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n>\n> 21 Id.\n>\n> 22 Id.\n>\n> 23 Id.\n>\n> U.S. Dep't of State Press Release, Responding to the PRC's Destabilizing and Irresponsible Behavior in Cyberspace (July 19, 2021), at https://www.state.gov/responding-to-the-prcs-destabilizing-and-irresponsible-behavior-in-cyberspace [https://perma.cc/FY2N-ZBEP].\n>\n> See White House Press Release, Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on Malicious Cyber Activity Attributable to the People's Republic of China (July 19, 2021), at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/19/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-malicious-cyber-activity-attributable-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china [https://perma.cc/CMR3-56SF].\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\nVol. 115:4\nWe stand in solidarity with all those who have been affected by recent malicious cyber activities including the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise. Such malicious cyber activities undermine security, confidence and stability in cyberspace. We acknowledge national statements by Allies, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, attributing responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise to the People's Republic of China. In line with our recent Brussels Summit Communiqué, we call on all States, including China, to uphold their international commitments and obligations and to act responsibly in the international system, including in cyberspace.²⁶\nOther U.S. allies followed suit in attributing the Microsoft Exchange hack and other malicious activities to China. The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.”²⁷ The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.”²⁸ Canada,²⁹ Japan,³⁰ Australia,³¹ and New Zealand,³² among others, released similar statements.³³\n²⁶ N.

This act confuses right with wrong and smears and suppresses China out of political purpose. China will never accept this.”³⁵ Asked specifically about NATO’s statement, Zhao alleged that “[b]y introducing military alliance into cyberspace, NATO is not making itself more secure” and instead “might spur cyber arms race, increase risks of cyber friction and conflict between countries, and undermine international peace and security.”³⁶\nThe coordinated attribution to China built on U.S. diplomatic efforts, including meetings and summits in June with NATO, the G7, the EU, and the United Kingdom. In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.”³⁷ NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.”³⁸ The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; . . . widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.”³⁹ The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”⁴⁰\nThe G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.”⁴¹ The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to\n³⁴ Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n³⁵ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n³⁶ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n³⁷ White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n³⁸ N.

As part of the \"New Atlantic Charter,\" the United States and the UK pledged \"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\" and to maintain collective security \"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45\nThese cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that \"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting, \"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces \"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is \"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51\nIt remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

In May, ransomware directed against Colonial Pipeline prompted the East Coast's biggest gasoline supplier to shut down its pipeline, causing gasoline shortages.⁵² Then in June, JBS, the world's largest meat company, paid an eleven million dollar ransom to avoid further disruptions to supply lines.⁵³ A third ransomware attack against a software provider, Kaseya, infected an estimated 1,500 small businesses, which faced ransom demands that reportedly ranged from $45,000 to $5 million.⁵⁴\nIn light of these ransomware incidents, all of which were carried out by Russia-based hacking groups, Biden has repeatedly raised concerns about ransomware with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At a June summit in Geneva, Biden proposed designating sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector and water systems, as \"off limits to attack.\"⁵⁵ During a July phone call with Putin, Biden expressed that the United States expects Russia to stop ransomware attacks emanating from Russia, promising to treat continued attacks as national security threats rather than criminal acts.⁵⁶ Shortly after the phone call, one of the Russia-based ransomware groups went offline, for reasons that remain unclear, but reappeared in September.⁵⁷\nCritics argue that the White House must do more to prevent and combat cyberattacks. Sen. Angus King (I-ME), who co-chairs the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in June that the U.S. tactics of sanctions and indictments \"haven't been nearly punitive enough.\"⁵⁸ He asserted, \"[w]e've been a cheap date in cyber where we've been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways [with] no real serious response.\"⁵⁹ Others specifically urged the United States to sanction China for the Microsoft Exchange hack.⁶⁰ In a background call with reporters, a senior Biden administration official warned that \"[t]he U.S. and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable.\"⁶¹\n⁵² David E.

The operation terminated hackers' access to the systems, but did not remove any malware that had already been downloaded.\nThen on July 19, the United States joined with the EU, NATO, and other allied countries to attribute the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and to call out China for “foster[ing] an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide.” The White House “[a]ttribut[ed] with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with [the People's Republic of China's (PRC)] MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.” Furthermore, the United States noted:“[H]ackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.”\n> In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.\nThe White House declared that “[t]he PRC's pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world.”\nIn a separate statement, the State Department explained:“Apart from the PRC's direct commitments not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, the international community has laid out clear expectations and guidelines for what constitutes responsible behavior in cyberspace.

Such malicious cyber activities undermine security, confidence and stability in cyberspace. We acknowledge national statements by Allies, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, attributing responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise to the People's Republic of China. In line with our recent Brussels Summit Communiqué, we call on all States, including China, to uphold their international commitments and obligations and to act responsibly in the international system, including in cyberspace.\nOther U.S. allies followed suit in attributing the Microsoft Exchange hack and other malicious activities to China. The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.” The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.” Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, among others, released similar statements.\n N.

In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.” NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.” The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; . . . widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.” The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”\nThe G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.” The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to\n Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n N.

As part of the \"New Atlantic Charter,\" the United States and the UK pledged \"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\" and to maintain collective security \"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45\nThese cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that \"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting, \"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces \"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is \"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51\nIt remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

At a June summit in Geneva, Biden proposed designating sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector and water systems, as \"off limits to attack.\" During a July phone call with Putin, Biden expressed that the United States expects Russia to stop ransomware attacks emanating from Russia, promising to treat continued attacks as national security threats rather than criminal acts. Shortly after the phone call, one of the Russia-based ransomware groups went offline, for reasons that remain unclear, but reappeared in September.\nCritics argue that the White House must do more to prevent and combat cyberattacks. Sen. Angus King (I-ME), who co-chairs the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in June that the U.S. tactics of sanctions and indictments \"haven't been nearly punitive enough.\" He asserted, \"[w]e've been a cheap date in cyber where we've been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways [with] no real serious response.\" Others specifically urged the United States to sanction China for the Microsoft Exchange hack. In a background call with reporters, a senior Biden administration official warned that \"[t]he U.S. and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable.\"\n David E.

These contract hackers cost governments and businesses billions of dollars in stolen intellectual property, ransom payments, and cybersecurity mitigation efforts, all while the MSS had them on its payroll.”\nMarking its first public attribution of malicious cyber activities to China, NATO announced:\n> U.S. Dep't of Justice Press Release, Justice Department Announces Court-Authorized Effort to Disrupt Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities (Apr. 13, 2021), at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft-exchange [https://perma.cc/9XBK-M5G7].\n>\n> 19 Id.\n>\n> 20 White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n>\n> 21 Id.\n>\n> 22 Id.\n>\n> 23 Id.\n>\n> U.S. Dep't of State Press Release, Responding to the PRC's Destabilizing and Irresponsible Behavior in Cyberspace (July 19, 2021), at https://www.state.gov/responding-to-the-prcs-destabilizing-and-irresponsible-behavior-in-cyberspace [https://perma.cc/FY2N-ZBEP].\n>\n> See White House Press Release, Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on Malicious Cyber Activity Attributable to the People's Republic of China (July 19, 2021), at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/19/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-malicious-cyber-activity-attributable-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china [https://perma.cc/CMR3-56SF].\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\nVol. 115:4\nWe stand in solidarity with all those who have been affected by recent malicious cyber activities including the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise. Such malicious cyber activities undermine security, confidence and stability in cyberspace. We acknowledge national statements by Allies, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, attributing responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise to the People's Republic of China. In line with our recent Brussels Summit Communiqué, we call on all States, including China, to uphold their international commitments and obligations and to act responsibly in the international system, including in cyberspace.\nOther U.S. allies followed suit in attributing the Microsoft Exchange hack and other malicious activities to China. The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.” The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.” Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, among others, released similar statements.\n N.

In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.” NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.” The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; . . . widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.” The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”\nThe G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.” The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to\n Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n N.

As part of the \"New Atlantic Charter,\" the United States and the UK pledged \"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\" and to maintain collective security \"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45\nThese cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that \"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting, \"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces \"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is \"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51\nIt remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

At a June summit in Geneva, Biden proposed designating sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector and water systems, as \"off limits to attack.\" During a July phone call with Putin, Biden expressed that the United States expects Russia to stop ransomware attacks emanating from Russia, promising to treat continued attacks as national security threats rather than criminal acts. Shortly after the phone call, one of the Russia-based ransomware groups went offline, for reasons that remain unclear, but reappeared in September.\nCritics argue that the White House must do more to prevent and combat cyberattacks. Sen. Angus King (I-ME), who co-chairs the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in June that the U.S. tactics of sanctions and indictments \"haven't been nearly punitive enough.\" He asserted, \"[w]e've been a cheap date in cyber where we've been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways [with] no real serious response.\" Others specifically urged the United States to sanction China for the Microsoft Exchange hack. In a background call with reporters, a senior Biden administration official warned that \"[t]he U.S. and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable.\"\n David E.

The operation terminated hackers' access to the systems, but did not remove any malware that had already been downloaded.\nThen on July 19, the United States joined with the EU, NATO, and other allied countries to attribute the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and to call out China for “foster[ing] an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide.” The White House “[a]ttribut[ed] with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with [the People's Republic of China's (PRC)] MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.” Furthermore, the United States noted:“[H]ackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.”\n> In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.\nThe White House declared that “[t]he PRC's pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world.”\nIn a separate statement, the State Department explained:“Apart from the PRC's direct commitments not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, the international community has laid out clear expectations and guidelines for what constitutes responsible behavior in cyberspace. Responsible states do not indiscriminately compromise global network security nor knowingly harbor cyber criminals—let alone sponsor or collaborate with them. These contract hackers cost governments and businesses billions of dollars in stolen intellectual property, ransom payments, and cybersecurity mitigation efforts, all while the MSS had them on its payroll.”\nMarking its first public attribution of malicious cyber activities to China, NATO announced:\n> U.S. Dep't of Justice Press Release, Justice Department Announces Court-Authorized Effort to Disrupt Exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities (Apr. 13, 2021), at https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft-exchange [https://perma.cc/9XBK-M5G7].\n>\n> 19 Id.\n>\n> 20 White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n>\n> 21 Id.\n>\n> 22 Id.\n>\n> 23 Id.\n>\n> U.S. Dep't of State Press Release, Responding to the PRC's Destabilizing and Irresponsible Behavior in Cyberspace (July 19, 2021), at https://www.state.gov/responding-to-the-prcs-destabilizing-and-irresponsible-behavior-in-cyberspace [https://perma.cc/FY2N-ZBEP].\n>\n> See White House Press Release, Background Press Call by Senior Administration Officials on Malicious Cyber Activity Attributable to the People's Republic of China (July 19, 2021), at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/19/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-malicious-cyber-activity-attributable-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china [https://perma.cc/CMR3-56SF].\nTHE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\nVol. 115:4\nWe stand in solidarity with all those who have been affected by recent malicious cyber activities including the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise. Such malicious cyber activities undermine security, confidence and stability in cyberspace. We acknowledge national statements by Allies, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, attributing responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise to the People's Republic of China. In line with our recent Brussels Summit Communiqué, we call on all States, including China, to uphold their international commitments and obligations and to act responsibly in the international system, including in cyberspace.\nOther U.S. allies followed suit in attributing the Microsoft Exchange hack and other malicious activities to China. The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.” The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.” Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, among others, released similar statements.\n N.

In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.” NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.” The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; . . . widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.” The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”\nThe G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.” The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to\n Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n N.

As part of the \"New Atlantic Charter,\" the United States and the UK pledged \"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\" and to maintain collective security \"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45\nThese cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that \"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting, \"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces \"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is \"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51\nIt remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

At a June summit in Geneva, Biden proposed designating sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector and water systems, as \"off limits to attack.\" During a July phone call with Putin, Biden expressed that the United States expects Russia to stop ransomware attacks emanating from Russia, promising to treat continued attacks as national security threats rather than criminal acts. Shortly after the phone call, one of the Russia-based ransomware groups went offline, for reasons that remain unclear, but reappeared in September.\nCritics argue that the White House must do more to prevent and combat cyberattacks. Sen. Angus King (I-ME), who co-chairs the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in June that the U.S. tactics of sanctions and indictments \"haven't been nearly punitive enough.\" He asserted, \"[w]e've been a cheap date in cyber where we've been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways [with] no real serious response.\" Others specifically urged the United States to sanction China for the Microsoft Exchange hack. In a background call with reporters, a senior Biden administration official warned that \"[t]he U.S. and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable.\"\n David E.

The operation terminated hackers' access to the systems, but did not remove any malware that had already been downloaded.\nThen on July 19, the United States joined with the EU, NATO, and other allied countries to attribute the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and to call out China for “foster[ing] an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide.” The White House “[a]ttribut[ed] with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with [the People's Republic of China's (PRC)] MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.” Furthermore, the United States noted:“[H]ackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.”\n> In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.\nThe White House declared that “[t]he PRC's pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world.”\nIn a separate statement, the State Department explained:“Apart from the PRC's direct commitments not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, the international community has laid out clear expectations and guidelines for what constitutes responsible behavior in cyberspace. Responsible states do not indiscriminately compromise global network security nor knowingly harbor cyber criminals—let alone sponsor or collaborate with them.

The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.”²⁷ The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.”²⁸ Canada,²⁹ Japan,³⁰ Australia,³¹ and New Zealand,³² among others, released similar statements.³³\n²⁶ N.

This act confuses right with wrong and smears and suppresses China out of political purpose. China will never accept this.”³⁵ Asked specifically about NATO’s statement, Zhao alleged that “[b]y introducing military alliance into cyberspace, NATO is not making itself more secure” and instead “might spur cyber arms race, increase risks of cyber friction and conflict between countries, and undermine international peace and security.”³⁶\nThe coordinated attribution to China built on U.S. diplomatic efforts, including meetings and summits in June with NATO, the G7, the EU, and the United Kingdom. In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.”³⁷ NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.”³⁸ The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; . . . widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.”³⁹ The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”⁴⁰\nThe G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.”⁴¹ The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to\n³⁴ Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n³⁵ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n³⁶ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n³⁷ White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n³⁸ N.

As part of the \"New Atlantic Charter,\" the United States and the UK pledged \"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\" and to maintain collective security \"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45\nThese cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that \"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting, \"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces \"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is \"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51\nIt remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

In May, ransomware directed against Colonial Pipeline prompted the East Coast's biggest gasoline supplier to shut down its pipeline, causing gasoline shortages.⁵² Then in June, JBS, the world's largest meat company, paid an eleven million dollar ransom to avoid further disruptions to supply lines.⁵³ A third ransomware attack against a software provider, Kaseya, infected an estimated 1,500 small businesses, which faced ransom demands that reportedly ranged from $45,000 to $5 million.⁵⁴\nIn light of these ransomware incidents, all of which were carried out by Russia-based hacking groups, Biden has repeatedly raised concerns about ransomware with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At a June summit in Geneva, Biden proposed designating sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector and water systems, as \"off limits to attack.\"⁵⁵ During a July phone call with Putin, Biden expressed that the United States expects Russia to stop ransomware attacks emanating from Russia, promising to treat continued attacks as national security threats rather than criminal acts.⁵⁶ Shortly after the phone call, one of the Russia-based ransomware groups went offline, for reasons that remain unclear, but reappeared in September.⁵⁷\nCritics argue that the White House must do more to prevent and combat cyberattacks.

The operation terminated hackers' access to the systems, but did not remove any malware that had already been downloaded.\nThen on July 19, the United States joined with the EU, NATO, and other allied countries to attribute the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and to call out China for “foster[ing] an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide.” The White House “[a]ttribut[ed] with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with [the People's Republic of China's (PRC)] MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.” Furthermore, the United States noted:“[H]ackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.”\n> In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.\nThe White House declared that “[t]he PRC's pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world.”\nIn a separate statement, the State Department explained:“Apart from the PRC's direct commitments not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, the international community has laid out clear expectations and guidelines for what constitutes responsible behavior in cyberspace. Responsible states do not indiscriminately compromise global network security nor knowingly harbor cyber criminals—let alone sponsor or collaborate with them.

The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.”²⁷ The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.”²⁸ Canada,²⁹ Japan,³⁰ Australia,³¹ and New Zealand,³² among others, released similar statements.³³ ²⁶ N.

In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.”³⁷ NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.”³⁸ The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes;... widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.”³⁹ The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”⁴⁰ The G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.”⁴¹ The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to ³⁴ Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n³⁵ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n³⁶ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n³⁷ White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n³⁸ N.

As part of the\"New Atlantic Charter,\"the United States and the UK pledged\"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\"and to maintain collective security\"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45 These cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that\"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting,\"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces\"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is\"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51 It remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

Sen. Angus King (I-ME), who co-chairs the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in June that the U.S. tactics of sanctions and indictments\"haven't been nearly punitive enough.\"⁵⁸ He asserted,\"[w]e've been a cheap date in cyber where we've been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways [with] no real serious response.\"⁵⁹ Others specifically urged the United States to sanction China for the Microsoft Exchange hack.⁶⁰ In a background call with reporters, a senior Biden administration official warned that\"[t]he U.S. and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable.\"⁶¹ ⁵² David E.

The operation terminated hackers' access to the systems, but did not remove any malware that had already been downloaded.\n\nThen on July 19, the United States joined with the EU, NATO, and other allied countries to attribute the Microsoft Exchange hack to actors affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and to call out China for “foster[ing] an intelligence enterprise that includes contract hackers who also conduct unsanctioned cyber operations worldwide.” The White House “[a]ttribut[ed] with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with [the People's Republic of China's (PRC)] MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server.” Furthermore, the United States noted:“[H]ackers with a history of working for the PRC Ministry of State Security (MSS) have engaged in ransomware attacks, cyber enabled extortion, crypto-jacking, and rank theft from victims around the world, all for financial gain.”\n\n> In some cases, we are aware that PRC government-affiliated cyber operators have conducted ransomware operations against private companies that have included ransom demands of millions of dollars.\n\nThe White House declared that “[t]he PRC's pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world.”\n\nIn a separate statement, the State Department explained:“Apart from the PRC's direct commitments not to engage in cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, the international community has laid out clear expectations and guidelines for what constitutes responsible behavior in cyberspace. Responsible states do not indiscriminately compromise global network security nor knowingly harbor cyber criminals—let alone sponsor or collaborate with them.

    "THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW\nVol. 115:4\n\nWe stand in solidarity with all those who have been affected by recent malicious cyber activities including the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise. Such malicious cyber activities undermine security, confidence and stability in cyberspace. We acknowledge national statements by Allies, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, attributing responsibility for the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise to the People's Republic of China. In line with our recent Brussels Summit Communiqué, we call on all States, including China, to uphold their international commitments and obligations and to act responsibly in the international system, including in cyberspace.²⁶\n\nOther U.S. allies followed suit in attributing the Microsoft Exchange hack and other malicious activities to China. The UK National Cyber Security Centre assessed with “almost certain[ty]” that the Exchange hack “was initiated and exploited by a Chinese state-backed threat actor,” and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asserted that it followed “a reckless but familiar pattern of behavior” and that “[t]he Chinese Government must end this systematic cyber sabotage and can expect to be held [to] account if it does not.”²⁷ The EU stated that it “strongly denounce[s] these malicious cyber activities, which are undertaken in contradiction with the norms of responsible state behaviour as endorsed by all UN member states,” and that it “urge[s] the Chinese authorities to adhere to these norms and not allow its territory to be used for malicious cyber activities, and [to] take all appropriate measures and reasonably available and feasible steps to detect, investigate and address the situation.”²⁸ Canada,²⁹ Japan,³⁰ Australia,³¹ and New Zealand,³² among others, released similar statements.³³\n\n²⁶ N.

    "CONTEMPORARY PRACTICE OF THE UNITED STATES\n719\n\nChina denied the allegations and accused the United States of cyberattacks.³⁴ In comments to the press, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian stated that “[t]he US ganged up with its allies to make groundless accusations out of thin air against China on the cyber security issue. This act confuses right with wrong and smears and suppresses China out of political purpose. China will never accept this.”³⁵ Asked specifically about NATO’s statement, Zhao alleged that “[b]y introducing military alliance into cyberspace, NATO is not making itself more secure” and instead “might spur cyber arms race, increase risks of cyber friction and conflict between countries, and undermine international peace and security.”³⁶\n\nThe coordinated attribution to China built on U.S. diplomatic efforts, including meetings and summits in June with NATO, the G7, the EU, and the United Kingdom. In announcing the attribution, the White House explained, “[f]rom the G7 and EU commitments around ransomware to NATO adopting a new cyber defense policy for the first time in seven years, the President is putting forward a common cyber approach with our allies and laying down clear expectations and markers on how responsible nations behave in cyberspace.”³⁷ NATO endorsed a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy in its June Brussels Summit Communiqué, noting that “[c]yber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive, coercive, and becoming ever more frequent,” and citing recent “ransomware incidents and other malicious cyber activity targeting our critical infrastructure and democratic institutions.”³⁸ The Communiqué called out Russia’s “hybrid actions,” including “attempted interference in Allied elections and democratic processes; . . . widespread disinformation campaigns; malicious cyber activities; and turning a blind eye to cyber criminals operating from its territory,” and called on China to “act responsibly in the international system, including in the space, cyber, and maritime domains.”³⁹ The Communiqué reaffirmed that NATO “is determined to employ the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including those conducted as part of hybrid campaigns, in accordance with international law.”⁴⁰\n\nThe G7’s Carbis Bay Summit Communiqué in June likewise addressed malicious cyber actions. The G7 leaders pledged to “work together to urgently address the escalating shared threat from criminal ransomware networks” and “call[ed] on all states to urgently identify and disrupt ransomware criminal networks operating from within their borders, and hold those networks accountable for their actions.”⁴¹ The Communiqué specifically urged Russia to\n\n³⁴ Joe McDonald, *China Rejects Hacking Charges, Accuses US of Cyberspying*, AP NEWS (July 20, 2021), at https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-china-hacking-6cd7d59f1b6aa4a0539d987e5340b705.\n\n³⁵ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian’s Regular Press Conference on July 20, 2021, at http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/fyrth/t1893769.htm; see also Embassy of China in the UK Press Release, Embassy Spokesperson’s Comment on the Remarks by the UK Side About Cyber Attack (July 20, 2021), at http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/t1893648.htm.\n\n³⁶ Embassy of China in the U.S. Press Release, supra note 35.\n\n³⁷ White House Press Release, supra note 17.\n\n³⁸ N.

As part of the \"New Atlantic Charter,\" the United States and the UK pledged \"to promote the framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace\" and to maintain collective security \"against the full spectrum of modern threats, including cyber threats.\"44 Later in June, the United States and EU announced a new ransomware working group.45\n\nThese cyber-specific agreements constitute one part of the Biden administration's broader program of shoring up alliances to counter China on both security and economic issues. During the June summits, NATO declared that \"China's stated ambitions and assertive behaviour present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance security.\"46 The G7 also laid down a broad policy of countering China, asserting, \"[w]ith regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.\"47 The Biden administration also worked with the EU to suspend the seventeen-year Airbus-Boeing trade dispute, which began in 2004 when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that the EU was illegally subsidizing Airbus to Boeing's disadvantage.48 The dispute led both sides to impose an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs,49 but the United States and EU agreed in June to lift those tariffs for the next five years, joining forces \"to challenge and counter China's nonmarket practices in this sector.\"50 President Biden elaborated that the U.S.-EU collaboration in the aircraft industry is \"a model we can build on for other challenges posed by China's economic model.\"51\n\nIt remains to be seen whether coordinated actions among U.S. allies can effectively address cyber threats.

In May, ransomware directed against Colonial Pipeline prompted the East Coast's biggest gasoline supplier to shut down its pipeline, causing gasoline shortages.⁵² Then in June, JBS, the world's largest meat company, paid an eleven million dollar ransom to avoid further disruptions to supply lines.⁵³ A third ransomware attack against a software provider, Kaseya, infected an estimated 1,500 small businesses, which faced ransom demands that reportedly ranged from $45,000 to $5 million.⁵⁴\n\nIn light of these ransomware incidents, all of which were carried out by Russia-based hacking groups, Biden has repeatedly raised concerns about ransomware with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At a June summit in Geneva, Biden proposed designating sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector and water systems, as \"off limits to attack.\"⁵⁵ During a July phone call with Putin, Biden expressed that the United States expects Russia to stop ransomware attacks emanating from Russia, promising to treat continued attacks as national security threats rather than criminal acts.⁵⁶ Shortly after the phone call, one of the Russia-based ransomware groups went offline, for reasons that remain unclear, but reappeared in September.⁵⁷\n\nCritics argue that the White House must do more to prevent and combat cyberattacks. Sen. Angus King (I-ME), who co-chairs the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in June that the U.S. tactics of sanctions and indictments \"haven't been nearly punitive enough.\"⁵⁸ He asserted, \"[w]e've been a cheap date in cyber where we've been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways [with] no real serious response.\"⁵⁹ Others specifically urged the United States to sanction China for the Microsoft Exchange hack.⁶⁰ In a background call with reporters, a senior Biden administration official warned that \"[t]he U.S. and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable.\"⁶¹\n\n⁵² David E.
