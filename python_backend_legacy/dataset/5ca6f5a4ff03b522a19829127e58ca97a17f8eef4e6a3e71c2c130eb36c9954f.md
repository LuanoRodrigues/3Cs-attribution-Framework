Andres\nWhile a great deal of work examines how states use conventional and nuclear weapons in militarized interstate bargaining, little work has examined how states bargain with cyber weapons to further their national interests. The few authors who take on this question conclude that it is difficult or even impossible to bargain with weapons that work best when they are secret and not attributable. This approach is mistaken. With cyber weapons, states regularly employ an inverted militarized bargaining method in which, rather than making demands backed by threats, policymakers use military assets to seize what they want while relying on diplomats to prevent reprisal and escalation.\nIn recent years, militaries have increased their spending on cyber weapons and become more active in placing offensive malware in their adversaries' systems. As these capabilities have proliferated, leaders from various countries have warned that cyber warfare can now cause harm on par with conventional weapons.¹ Nevertheless, the increase in the military use of the cyber domain has not been accompanied by much academic discussion about the diplomatic bargaining strategies that accompany these armaments.²\nPart of the problem scholars have with writing about\nRichard B. Andres is Professor of National Security Strategy at the U.S. National War College, focusing on cyber, aerospace, and energy. Previously, he was Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force and has led teams developing strategy for the White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other combatant commands.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [119]\nINVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY\ncyber strategy is that cyber diplomacy does not fit well into existing models of militarized bargaining. Standard bargaining models of war posit that states deploy weapons in order to increase their diplomatic leverage over other states.³ National leaders display their military capabilities to deter or compel their adversaries. Unlike most conventional arms, however, cyber weapons often become less operationally effective when they cease to be secret and when they can be attributed to a specific attacker. Thus the paradox: when a state\nThe current theoretical understanding of cyber diplomacy is unsatisfying. The argument that secret and anonymous weapons cannot be used to achieve political goals is inaccurate. States regularly use secret and anonymous military power in conjunction with diplomacy using a technique I term inverted militarized diplomacy, in which states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation.

In short, diplomatic threats that reveal cyber weapons tend to nullify themselves.⁴\nThe main way the international relations literature has addressed this problem is to avoid it. Eric Gartzke writes that cyberwar is a myth; policymakers have exaggerated the threat.⁵ Thomas Rid argues that the requirement for secrecy and anonymity prevents policymakers from using cyber weapons as tools of policy.⁶ Martin Libicki goes further, arguing that the fact that cyber weapons rely on deception makes it difficult to even theorize about how they might mesh with nations’ grand strategic goals.⁷\nadversaries’ commerce or fomenting rebellion in opponents’ populations. Today, inverted militarized diplomacy is central to the three main methods states use to employ cyber weapons against each other. Over the last few years, the cyber strategies major powers have utilized have had a significant effect on global economics, politics and balances of power.\n# Weapons Technology and Inverted Militarized Diplomacy. Over the last few decades, a good deal of work has explored how states use weapons to bargain. In the simplest model of bargaining, when an initiator desires a good held by a target, it makes a demand backed by the threat of force. When a target receives the demand,\nGeorgetown Journal of International Affairs\nANDRES Military Matters\nit must decide whether to resist or comply. If it resists, the initiator must choose whether to go through with the threat. When the target believes the initiator's threat is credible and that it can impose costs greater than the cost of losing the disputed good, it will concede. If the target believes the threat is a bluff or that the initiator does not have sufficient military capacity to impose costs greater than the value of the disputed good, it will resist.⁸\nAn interesting line of research into militarized diplomacy involves weapons technology and tactics. A highly scrutinized phenomenon involves the difference between bargaining with conventional and nuclear weapons. For states bargaining with conventional weapons, the classic problem involves how to make threats credible, since both states have incentives to exaggerate the strengths of their military power. The traditional solution is to publicly display capabilities either statically or on the battlefield in limited wars. While talk is cheap, displays are harder to misrepresent. When states make demands backed by conventional weapons, the threats generally must be attributable and there is an incentive to display the military capabilities that is being used to carry out both deterrent and compellent threats.⁹\nThere are substantial similarities between the way states bargain with conventional and nuclear weapons. There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness. To overcome this problem, states attempt to build artificial irrationality into their bureaucratic systems and otherwise increase their opponents' perception that they are willing to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances. States employ tripwire deployments of troops, hair-trigger forces, autonomous battlefield nuclear weapons and other schemes to increase the chances that a state would use nuclear weapons even when doing so might lead to general war and mutually assured destruction.¹⁰\nWhile diplomacy involving conventional and nuclear weapons relies on overt displays and attributable threats, there are classes of weapons and tactics that work best when this process is inverted; however, this type of militarized bargaining has received little attention in the bargaining literature. In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario,\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [121]\nthe initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future. It differs from a brute force strategy in that the initiator does not forgo diplomacy; rather it uses diplomacy to prevent the target from retaliating. Traditionally, diplomats use this strategy to lower the chances of reprisal by lowering the target's expectations about the utility of retaliation and escalation. This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation.\nFor practical reasons, some types of weapons and tactics facilitate inverted militarized diplomacy and some do not; four characteristics tend to increase the utility of a military technology for this purpose. First, technology and techniques that allow military force to be used without attribution (or at least provide plausible deniability) increase its utility. Second, methods that permit forces to seize goods with high political or economic value make the approach more attractive. Third, less socially provocative weapons and tactics are more conducive to the inverted bargaining approach; for instance, if a state fired a cruise missile to destroy a factory, most observers would consider the act more provocative than if the state employed a computer virus to accomplish the same end. Finally, the approach works best when the initiator perceives an asymmetrical opportunity to use force; that is, when the initiator has the opportunity to take something from the target by force but the target cannot easily respond in kind. Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu\nANDRES Military Matters\nlarly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps\nboth the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.[14]\nThe dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [123]\nretaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17\n## Fomenting Revolution\nA second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is\nANDRES Military Matters\neasily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³\nWhile this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile. The industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure that controls most grids globally are poorly protected and difficult to defend. Against a country like the United States, a military launching a full scale attack on an electric\n# The dilemma for [intellectual property]-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in retaliation.\nlution or coup in Russia or China has the potential to lead to unintended consequences such as global financial turmoil or loose nuclear weapons.\n## Critical infrastructure sabotage.\nA third way states are employing cyber weapons involves sabotaging opponents' critical infrastructure. Over the last four years, U.S. Directors of National Intelligence have repeatedly described this as the foremost item in their annual threat assessments to the Senate.²² These types of attacks are sometimes described as capable of creating a Cyber Pearl Harbor. Just as Russian and Chinese leaders describe fomenting rebel-\ngrid would most likely use malware to attempt to destroy hardware such as ultrahigh voltage transformers and large generators that require months or years to replace. While it would be difficult to accomplish, a fully successful attack could result in millions of deaths and national economic paralysis.²⁵ A state might be willing to launch this type of attack if it believed it had no other options; for instance, if its regime were about to fall to conventional attack. A state might also launch a smaller attack with the goal of causing economic loss and military debilitation. Attackers might see this second type of action as operating below the threshold\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [125]\nINVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY\nthat would invite massive retaliation by its opponent's military.²⁶ Over the last year, a large proportion of electric companies around the globe have reported finding malware in the systems that control their hardware.²⁷\nCritical infrastructure sabotage has asymmetrical political value in that\nprevent reprisal. Beyond this, a key element that makes this bargaining strategy successful involves social conventions about cyberspace; if opponents buried physical bombs under transformers and generators it is more likely that populations and policymakers would feel compelled to retaliate.\n# [Sabotaging critical infrastructure] is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\ndeveloped economies are often more dependent on critical infrastructure than less developed states. When the power goes out in most rich countries, within seconds economic transactions and communication stop working and within hours electricity dependent water and fuel stop flowing. Developing nations tend to be less dependent on electricity. More importantly, though, this type of weapon is a way for states without global power projection capability to harm their distant opponents without spending trillions of dollars on bases, bombers, and aircraft carriers.\nLike the methods of cyber-attack described earlier, critical infrastructure sabotage employs a form of inverted diplomacy. States that place malware on opponents' systems without activating it do so to increase their military power. Rather than making diplomatic demands backed by cyber-weapons, their militaries emplace their weapons in their opponents' territory by stealth and fraud. Diplomatically, attackers rely on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability and lack of precedent to\nThe sabotage strategy carries a number of difficulties and risks. These weapons and techniques are challenging to develop; conducting the kind of virtual Pearl Harbor U.S. policymakers warn about would be tough. Even if a state had the capability, the weapons would be unreliable because an attacker would not know if the defender had neutralized the malware in the months or years it lay dormant waiting for the signal to detonate.²⁸ Moreover, sending potentially devastating malware into the wild is dangerous both because discovered-malware can be reverse engineered and because of the possibility that malware resident on critical infrastructure might detonate through error or accident.²⁹ In short, this approach is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\nConclusion. The above analysis described the logic behind the three main ways states are using offensive cyber weapons. States use these arms\n[126] Georgetown Journal of International Affairs\nANDRES Military Matters\nto achieve political objectives by force and fraud, and then use diplomatic efforts to prevent retaliation and escalation. This reverses the model political scientists are accustomed to, in which militarized interactions begin with diplomats making threats about the potential future use of force. The literature is mistaken in arguing that states cannot utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy. Just as nuclear weapons require bargaining strategies somewhat different from conventional weapons, cyber weapons require an approach somewhat different from either conventional or nuclear diplomacy. Policymakers and generals around the world are using this model to achieve their foreign policy objectives.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [127]\nINVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY",

      "# Weapons Technology and Inverted Militarized Diplomacy. Over the last few decades, a good deal of work has explored how states use weapons to bargain. In the simplest model of bargaining, when an initiator desires a good held by a target, it makes a demand backed by the threat of force. When a target receives the demand, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs ANDRES Military Matters it must decide whether to resist or comply. If it resists, the initiator must choose whether to go through with the threat. When the target believes the initiator's threat is credible and that it can impose costs greater than the cost of losing the disputed good, it will concede. If the target believes the threat is a bluff or that the initiator does not have sufficient military capacity to impose costs greater than the value of the disputed good, it will resist.⁸ An interesting line of research into militarized diplomacy involves weapons technology and tactics. A highly scrutinized phenomenon involves the difference between bargaining with conventional and nuclear weapons. For states bargaining with conventional weapons, the classic problem involves how to make threats credible, since both states have incentives to exaggerate the strengths of their military power. The traditional solution is to publicly display capabilities either statically or on the battlefield in limited wars. While talk is cheap, displays are harder to misrepresent. When states make demands backed by conventional weapons, the threats generally must be attributable and there is an incentive to display the military capabilities that is being used to carry out both deterrent and compellent threats.⁹ There are substantial similarities between the way states bargain with conventional and nuclear weapons. There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness. To overcome this problem, states attempt to build artificial irrationality into their bureaucratic systems and otherwise increase their opponents' perception that they are willing to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances. States employ tripwire deployments of troops, hair-trigger forces, autonomous battlefield nuclear weapons and other schemes to increase the chances that a state would use nuclear weapons even when doing so might lead to general war and mutually assured destruction.¹⁰ While diplomacy involving conventional and nuclear weapons relies on overt displays and attributable threats, there are classes of weapons and tactics that work best when this process is inverted; however, this type of militarized bargaining has received little attention in the bargaining literature. In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario, International Engagement on Cyber IV [121] the initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future. It differs from a brute force strategy in that the initiator does not forgo diplomacy; rather it uses diplomacy to prevent the target from retaliating. Traditionally, diplomats use this strategy to lower the chances of reprisal by lowering the target's expectations about the utility of retaliation and escalation. This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation."

With cyber weapons, states regularly employ an inverted militarized bargaining method in which, rather than making demands backed by threats, policymakers use military assets to seize what they want while relying on diplomats to prevent reprisal and escalation.": "In recent years, militaries have increased their spending on cyber weapons and become more active in placing offensive malware in their adversaries' systems. As these capabilities have proliferated, leaders from various countries have warned that cyber warfare can now cause harm on par with conventional weapons.¹ Nevertheless, the increase in the military use of the cyber domain has not been accompanied by much academic discussion about the diplomatic bargaining strategies that accompany these armaments.² Part of the problem scholars have with writing about Richard B. Andres is Professor of National Security Strategy at the U.S. National War College, focusing on cyber, aerospace, and energy. Previously, he was Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force and has led teams developing strategy for the White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other combatant commands.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [119] INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY cyber strategy is that cyber diplomacy does not fit well into existing models of militarized bargaining. Standard bargaining models of war posit that states deploy weapons in order to increase their diplomatic leverage over other states.³ National leaders display their military capabilities to deter or compel their adversaries. Unlike most conventional arms, however, cyber weapons often become less operationally effective when they cease to be secret and when they can be attributed to a specific attacker. Thus the paradox: when a state The current theoretical understanding of cyber diplomacy is unsatisfying. The argument that secret and anonymous weapons cannot be used to achieve political goals is inaccurate. States regularly use secret and anonymous military power in conjunction with diplomacy using a technique I term inverted militarized diplomacy, in which states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation.

In short, diplomatic threats that reveal cyber weapons tend to nullify themselves.⁴ The main way the international relations literature has addressed this problem is to avoid it. Eric Gartzke writes that cyberwar is a myth; policymakers have exaggerated the threat.⁵ Thomas Rid argues that the requirement for secrecy and anonymity prevents policymakers from using cyber weapons as tools of policy.⁶ Martin Libicki goes further, arguing that the fact that cyber weapons rely on deception makes it difficult to even theorize about how they might mesh with nations’ grand strategic goals.⁷ adversaries’ commerce or fomenting rebellion in opponents’ populations.

This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation.": "For practical reasons, some types of weapons and tactics facilitate inverted militarized diplomacy and some do not; four characteristics tend to increase the utility of a military technology for this purpose. First, technology and techniques that allow military force to be used without attribution (or at least provide plausible deniability) increase its utility. Second, methods that permit forces to seize goods with high political or economic value make the approach more attractive. Third, less socially provocative weapons and tactics are more conducive to the inverted bargaining approach; for instance, if a state fired a cruise missile to destroy a factory, most observers would consider the act more provocative than if the state employed a computer virus to accomplish the same end. Finally, the approach works best when the initiator perceives an asymmetrical opportunity to use force; that is, when the initiator has the opportunity to take something from the target by force but the target cannot easily respond in kind. Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu ANDRES Military Matters larly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps both the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.[14] The dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in International Engagement on Cyber IV [123] retaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17 ## Fomenting Revolution A second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is ANDRES Military Matters easily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³ While this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile. The industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure that controls most grids globally are poorly protected and difficult to defend. Against a country like the United States, a military launching a full scale attack on an electric # The dilemma for [intellectual property]-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in retaliation.\nlution or coup in Russia or China has the potential to lead to unintended consequences such as global financial turmoil or loose nuclear weapons.",
    "## Critical infrastructure sabotage.": "A third way states are employing cyber weapons involves sabotaging opponents' critical infrastructure.

Andres While a great deal of work examines how states use conventional and nuclear weapons in militarized interstate bargaining, little work has examined how states bargain with cyber weapons to further their national interests. The few authors who take on this question conclude that it is difficult or even impossible to bargain with weapons that work best when they are secret and not attributable. This approach is mistaken. With cyber weapons, states regularly employ an inverted militarized bargaining method in which, rather than making demands backed by threats, policymakers use military assets to seize what they want while relying on diplomats to prevent reprisal and escalation.\nIn recent years, militaries have increased their spending on cyber weapons and become more active in placing offensive malware in their adversaries' systems. As these capabilities have proliferated, leaders from various countries have warned that cyber warfare can now cause harm on par with conventional weapons.¹ Nevertheless, the increase in the military use of the cyber domain has not been accompanied by much academic discussion about the diplomatic bargaining strategies that accompany these armaments.² Part of the problem scholars have with writing about Richard B.

Today, inverted militarized diplomacy is central to the three main methods states use to employ cyber weapons against each other. Over the last few years, the cyber strategies major powers have utilized have had a significant effect on global economics, politics and balances of power.\n# Weapons Technology and Inverted Militarized Diplomacy. Over the last few decades, a good deal of work has explored how states use weapons to bargain. In the simplest model of bargaining, when an initiator desires a good held by a target, it makes a demand backed by the threat of force. When a target receives the demand, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs ANDRES Military Matters it must decide whether to resist or comply. If it resists, the initiator must choose whether to go through with the threat. When the target believes the initiator's threat is credible and that it can impose costs greater than the cost of losing the disputed good, it will concede. If the target believes the threat is a bluff or that the initiator does not have sufficient military capacity to impose costs greater than the value of the disputed good, it will resist.⁸ An interesting line of research into militarized diplomacy involves weapons technology and tactics. A highly scrutinized phenomenon involves the difference between bargaining with conventional and nuclear weapons. For states bargaining with conventional weapons, the classic problem involves how to make threats credible, since both states have incentives to exaggerate the strengths of their military power. The traditional solution is to publicly display capabilities either statically or on the battlefield in limited wars. While talk is cheap, displays are harder to misrepresent. When states make demands backed by conventional weapons, the threats generally must be attributable and there is an incentive to display the military capabilities that is being used to carry out both deterrent and compellent threats.⁹ There are substantial similarities between the way states bargain with conventional and nuclear weapons. There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness. To overcome this problem, states attempt to build artificial irrationality into their bureaucratic systems and otherwise increase their opponents' perception that they are willing to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances. States employ tripwire deployments of troops, hair-trigger forces, autonomous battlefield nuclear weapons and other schemes to increase the chances that a state would use nuclear weapons even when doing so might lead to general war and mutually assured destruction.¹⁰ While diplomacy involving conventional and nuclear weapons relies on overt displays and attributable threats, there are classes of weapons and tactics that work best when this process is inverted; however, this type of militarized bargaining has received little attention in the bargaining literature. In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario, International Engagement on Cyber IV [121] the initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future. It differs from a brute force strategy in that the initiator does not forgo diplomacy; rather it uses diplomacy to prevent the target from retaliating. Traditionally, diplomats use this strategy to lower the chances of reprisal by lowering the target's expectations about the utility of retaliation and escalation. This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation.\nFor practical reasons, some types of weapons and tactics facilitate inverted militarized diplomacy and some do not; four characteristics tend to increase the utility of a military technology for this purpose. First, technology and techniques that allow military force to be used without attribution (or at least provide plausible deniability) increase its utility. Second, methods that permit forces to seize goods with high political or economic value make the approach more attractive. Third, less socially provocative weapons and tactics are more conducive to the inverted bargaining approach; for instance, if a state fired a cruise missile to destroy a factory, most observers would consider the act more provocative than if the state employed a computer virus to accomplish the same end. Finally, the approach works best when the initiator perceives an asymmetrical opportunity to use force; that is, when the initiator has the opportunity to take something from the target by force but the target cannot easily respond in kind. Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu ANDRES Military Matters larly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps both the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.[14] The dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in International Engagement on Cyber IV [123] retaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17 ## Fomenting Revolution A second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is ANDRES Military Matters easily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³ While this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile. The industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure that controls most grids globally are poorly protected and difficult to defend. Against a country like the United States, a military launching a full scale attack on an electric # The dilemma for [intellectual property]-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in retaliation.\nlution or coup in Russia or China has the potential to lead to unintended consequences such as global financial turmoil or loose nuclear weapons.\n## Critical infrastructure sabotage.\nA third way states are employing cyber weapons involves sabotaging opponents' critical infrastructure. Over the last four years, U.S. Directors of National Intelligence have repeatedly described this as the foremost item in their annual threat assessments to the Senate.²² These types of attacks are sometimes described as capable of creating a Cyber Pearl Harbor. Just as Russian and Chinese leaders describe fomenting rebelgrid would most likely use malware to attempt to destroy hardware such as ultrahigh voltage transformers and large generators that require months or years to replace. While it would be difficult to accomplish, a fully successful attack could result in millions of deaths and national economic paralysis.²⁵ A state might be willing to launch this type of attack if it believed it had no other options; for instance, if its regime were about to fall to conventional attack. A state might also launch a smaller attack with the goal of causing economic loss and military debilitation. Attackers might see this second type of action as operating below the threshold International Engagement on Cyber IV [125] INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY that would invite massive retaliation by its opponent's military.²⁶ Over the last year, a large proportion of electric companies around the globe have reported finding malware in the systems that control their hardware.²⁷ Critical infrastructure sabotage has asymmetrical political value in that prevent reprisal. Beyond this, a key element that makes this bargaining strategy successful involves social conventions about cyberspace; if opponents buried physical bombs under transformers and generators it is more likely that populations and policymakers would feel compelled to retaliate.\n# [Sabotaging critical infrastructure] is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\ndeveloped economies are often more dependent on critical infrastructure than less developed states. When the power goes out in most rich countries, within seconds economic transactions and communication stop working and within hours electricity dependent water and fuel stop flowing. Developing nations tend to be less dependent on electricity. More importantly, though, this type of weapon is a way for states without global power projection capability to harm their distant opponents without spending trillions of dollars on bases, bombers, and aircraft carriers.\nLike the methods of cyber-attack described earlier, critical infrastructure sabotage employs a form of inverted diplomacy. States that place malware on opponents' systems without activating it do so to increase their military power. Rather than making diplomatic demands backed by cyber-weapons, their militaries emplace their weapons in their opponents' territory by stealth and fraud. Diplomatically, attackers rely on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability and lack of precedent to The sabotage strategy carries a number of difficulties and risks. These weapons and techniques are challenging to develop; conducting the kind of virtual Pearl Harbor U.S. policymakers warn about would be tough. Even if a state had the capability, the weapons would be unreliable because an attacker would not know if the defender had neutralized the malware in the months or years it lay dormant waiting for the signal to detonate.²⁸ Moreover, sending potentially devastating malware into the wild is dangerous both because discovered-malware can be reverse engineered and because of the possibility that malware resident on critical infrastructure might detonate through error or accident.²⁹ In short, this approach is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\nConclusion. The above analysis described the logic behind the three main ways states are using offensive cyber weapons. States use these arms [126] Georgetown Journal of International Affairs ANDRES Military Matters to achieve political objectives by force and fraud, and then use diplomatic efforts to prevent retaliation and escalation. This reverses the model political scientists are accustomed to, in which militarized interactions begin with diplomats making threats about the potential future use of force. The literature is mistaken in arguing that states cannot utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy. Just as nuclear weapons require bargaining strategies somewhat different from conventional weapons, cyber weapons require an approach somewhat different from either conventional or nuclear diplomacy. Policymakers and generals around the world are using this model to achieve their foreign policy objectives.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [127] INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY",

The traditional solution is to publicly display capabilities either statically or on the battlefield in limited wars. While talk is cheap, displays are harder to misrepresent. When states make demands backed by conventional weapons, the threats generally must be attributable and there is an incentive to display the military capabilities that is being used to carry out both deterrent and compellent threats.⁹\nThere are substantial similarities between the way states bargain with conventional and nuclear weapons. There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness. To overcome this problem, states attempt to build artificial irrationality into their bureaucratic systems and otherwise increase their opponents' perception that they are willing to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances. States employ tripwire deployments of troops, hair-trigger forces, autonomous battlefield nuclear weapons and other schemes to increase the chances that a state would use nuclear weapons even when doing so might lead to general war and mutually assured destruction.¹⁰\nWhile diplomacy involving conventional and nuclear weapons relies on overt displays and attributable threats, there are classes of weapons and tactics that work best when this process is inverted; however, this type of militarized bargaining has received little attention in the bargaining literature. In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario,\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nthe initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future. It differs from a brute force strategy in that the initiator does not forgo diplomacy; rather it uses diplomacy to prevent the target from retaliating. Traditionally, diplomats use this strategy to lower the chances of reprisal by lowering the target's expectations about the utility of retaliation and escalation. This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation.\nFor practical reasons, some types of weapons and tactics facilitate inverted militarized diplomacy and some do not; four characteristics tend to increase the utility of a military technology for this purpose. First, technology and techniques that allow military force to be used without attribution (or at least provide plausible deniability) increase its utility. Second, methods that permit forces to seize goods with high political or economic value make the approach more attractive. Third, less socially provocative weapons and tactics are more conducive to the inverted bargaining approach; for instance, if a state fired a cruise missile to destroy a factory, most observers would consider the act more provocative than if the state employed a computer virus to accomplish the same end. Finally, the approach works best when the initiator perceives an asymmetrical opportunity to use force; that is, when the initiator has the opportunity to take something from the target by force but the target cannot easily respond in kind. Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu\nANDRES Military Matters\nlarly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps\nboth the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.\nThe dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nretaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17\n## Fomenting Revolution\nA second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is\nANDRES Military Matters\neasily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³\nWhile this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile. The industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure that controls most grids globally are poorly protected and difficult to defend. Against a country like the United States, a military launching a full scale attack on an electric\n# The dilemma for [intellectual property]-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in retaliation.\nlution or coup in Russia or China has the potential to lead to unintended consequences such as global financial turmoil or loose nuclear weapons.\n## Critical infrastructure sabotage.\nA third way states are employing cyber weapons involves sabotaging opponents' critical infrastructure. Over the last four years, U.S. Directors of National Intelligence have repeatedly described this as the foremost item in their annual threat assessments to the Senate.²² These types of attacks are sometimes described as capable of creating a Cyber Pearl Harbor. Just as Russian and Chinese leaders describe fomenting rebel-\ngrid would most likely use malware to attempt to destroy hardware such as ultrahigh voltage transformers and large generators that require months or years to replace. While it would be difficult to accomplish, a fully successful attack could result in millions of deaths and national economic paralysis.²⁵ A state might be willing to launch this type of attack if it believed it had no other options; for instance, if its regime were about to fall to conventional attack. A state might also launch a smaller attack with the goal of causing economic loss and military debilitation. Attackers might see this second type of action as operating below the threshold\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nINVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY\nthat would invite massive retaliation by its opponent's military.²⁶ Over the last year, a large proportion of electric companies around the globe have reported finding malware in the systems that control their hardware.²⁷\nCritical infrastructure sabotage has asymmetrical political value in that\nprevent reprisal. Beyond this, a key element that makes this bargaining strategy successful involves social conventions about cyberspace; if opponents buried physical bombs under transformers and generators it is more likely that populations and policymakers would feel compelled to retaliate.\n# [Sabotaging critical infrastructure] is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\ndeveloped economies are often more dependent on critical infrastructure than less developed states. When the power goes out in most rich countries, within seconds economic transactions and communication stop working and within hours electricity dependent water and fuel stop flowing. Developing nations tend to be less dependent on electricity. More importantly, though, this type of weapon is a way for states without global power projection capability to harm their distant opponents without spending trillions of dollars on bases, bombers, and aircraft carriers.\nLike the methods of cyber-attack described earlier, critical infrastructure sabotage employs a form of inverted diplomacy. States that place malware on opponents' systems without activating it do so to increase their military power. Rather than making diplomatic demands backed by cyber-weapons, their militaries emplace their weapons in their opponents' territory by stealth and fraud. Diplomatically, attackers rely on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability and lack of precedent to\nThe sabotage strategy carries a number of difficulties and risks. These weapons and techniques are challenging to develop; conducting the kind of virtual Pearl Harbor U.S. policymakers warn about would be tough. Even if a state had the capability, the weapons would be unreliable because an attacker would not know if the defender had neutralized the malware in the months or years it lay dormant waiting for the signal to detonate.²⁸ Moreover, sending potentially devastating malware into the wild is dangerous both because discovered-malware can be reverse engineered and because of the possibility that malware resident on critical infrastructure might detonate through error or accident.²⁹ In short, this approach is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\nConclusion. The above analysis described the logic behind the three main ways states are using offensive cyber weapons. States use these arms\n Georgetown Journal of International Affairs\nANDRES Military Matters\nto achieve political objectives by force and fraud, and then use diplomatic efforts to prevent retaliation and escalation. This reverses the model political scientists are accustomed to, in which militarized interactions begin with diplomats making threats about the potential future use of force. The literature is mistaken in arguing that states cannot utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy. Just as nuclear weapons require bargaining strategies somewhat different from conventional weapons, cyber weapons require an approach somewhat different from either conventional or nuclear diplomacy. Policymakers and generals around the world are using this model to achieve their foreign policy objectives.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nINVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY"

Andres\nWhile a great deal of work examines how states use conventional and nuclear weapons in militarized interstate bargaining, little work has examined how states bargain with cyber weapons to further their national interests. The few authors who take on this question conclude that it is difficult or even impossible to bargain with weapons that work best when they are secret and not attributable. This approach is mistaken. With cyber weapons, states regularly employ an inverted militarized bargaining method in which, rather than making demands backed by threats, policymakers use military assets to seize what they want while relying on diplomats to prevent reprisal and escalation.\nIn recent years, militaries have increased their spending on cyber weapons and become more active in placing offensive malware in their adversaries' systems. As these capabilities have proliferated, leaders from various countries have warned that cyber warfare can now cause harm on par with conventional weapons.¹ Nevertheless, the increase in the military use of the cyber domain has not been accompanied by much academic discussion about the diplomatic bargaining strategies that accompany these armaments.²\nPart of the problem scholars have with writing about\nRichard B. Andres is Professor of National Security Strategy at the U.S. National War College, focusing on cyber, aerospace, and energy. Previously, he was Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force and has led teams developing strategy for the White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other combatant commands.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nINVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY\ncyber strategy is that cyber diplomacy does not fit well into existing models of militarized bargaining. Standard bargaining models of war posit that states deploy weapons in order to increase their diplomatic leverage over other states.³ National leaders display their military capabilities to deter or compel their adversaries. Unlike most conventional arms, however, cyber weapons often become less operationally effective when they cease to be secret and when they can be attributed to a specific attacker. Thus the paradox: when a state\nThe current theoretical understanding of cyber diplomacy is unsatisfying. The argument that secret and anonymous weapons cannot be used to achieve political goals is inaccurate. States regularly use secret and anonymous military power in conjunction with diplomacy using a technique I term inverted militarized diplomacy, in which states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation. Historically, this method has been used most often by nations employing pirates against\n# Using inverted militarized diplomacy, states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation.\nmakes its cyber threats transparent in order to advance diplomatic ends, it renders its cyber capabilities less operationally potent and thus diplomatically less useful. In short, diplomatic threats that reveal cyber weapons tend to nullify themselves.⁴\nThe main way the international relations literature has addressed this problem is to avoid it. Eric Gartzke writes that cyberwar is a myth; policymakers have exaggerated the threat.⁵ Thomas Rid argues that the requirement for secrecy and anonymity prevents policymakers from using cyber weapons as tools of policy.⁶ Martin Libicki goes further, arguing that the fact that cyber weapons rely on deception makes it difficult to even theorize about how they might mesh with nations’ grand strategic goals.⁷\nadversaries’ commerce or fomenting rebellion in opponents’ populations. Today, inverted militarized diplomacy is central to the three main methods states use to employ cyber weapons against each other. Over the last few years, the cyber strategies major powers have utilized have had a significant effect on global economics, politics and balances of power.\n# Weapons Technology and Inverted Militarized Diplomacy. Over the last few decades, a good deal of work has explored how states use weapons to bargain. In the simplest model of bargaining, when an initiator desires a good held by a target, it makes a demand backed by the threat of force. When a target receives the demand,\nGeorgetown Journal of International Affairs\nANDRES Military Matters\nit must decide whether to resist or comply. If it resists, the initiator must choose whether to go through with the threat. When the target believes the initiator's threat is credible and that it can impose costs greater than the cost of losing the disputed good, it will concede. If the target believes the threat is a bluff or that the initiator does not have sufficient military capacity to impose costs greater than the value of the disputed good, it will resist.⁸\nAn interesting line of research into militarized diplomacy involves weapons technology and tactics. A highly scrutinized phenomenon involves the difference between bargaining with conventional and nuclear weapons. For states bargaining with conventional weapons, the classic problem involves how to make threats credible, since both states have incentives to exaggerate the strengths of their military power.

There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness.

In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario,\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nthe initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future.

Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu\nANDRES Military Matters\nlarly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps\nboth the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.\nThe dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV\nretaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17\n## Fomenting Revolution\nA second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is\nANDRES Military Matters\neasily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³\nWhile this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile.

Andres While a great deal of work examines how states use conventional and nuclear weapons in militarized interstate bargaining, little work has examined how states bargain with cyber weapons to further their national interests. The few authors who take on this question conclude that it is difficult or even impossible to bargain with weapons that work best when they are secret and not attributable. This approach is mistaken. With cyber weapons, states regularly employ an inverted militarized bargaining method in which, rather than making demands backed by threats, policymakers use military assets to seize what they want while relying on diplomats to prevent reprisal and escalation.\nIn recent years, militaries have increased their spending on cyber weapons and become more active in placing offensive malware in their adversaries' systems. As these capabilities have proliferated, leaders from various countries have warned that cyber warfare can now cause harm on par with conventional weapons.¹ Nevertheless, the increase in the military use of the cyber domain has not been accompanied by much academic discussion about the diplomatic bargaining strategies that accompany these armaments.² Part of the problem scholars have with writing about Richard B. Andres is Professor of National Security Strategy at the U.S. National War College, focusing on cyber, aerospace, and energy. Previously, he was Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force and has led teams developing strategy for the White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other combatant commands.\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [119] INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY cyber strategy is that cyber diplomacy does not fit well into existing models of militarized bargaining. Standard bargaining models of war posit that states deploy weapons in order to increase their diplomatic leverage over other states.³ National leaders display their military capabilities to deter or compel their adversaries. Unlike most conventional arms, however, cyber weapons often become less operationally effective when they cease to be secret and when they can be attributed to a specific attacker. Thus the paradox: when a state The current theoretical understanding of cyber diplomacy is unsatisfying. The argument that secret and anonymous weapons cannot be used to achieve political goals is inaccurate. States regularly use secret and anonymous military power in conjunction with diplomacy using a technique I term inverted militarized diplomacy, in which states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation. Historically, this method has been used most often by nations employing pirates against # Using inverted militarized diplomacy, states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation.\nmakes its cyber threats transparent in order to advance diplomatic ends, it renders its cyber capabilities less operationally potent and thus diplomatically less useful. In short, diplomatic threats that reveal cyber weapons tend to nullify themselves.⁴ The main way the international relations literature has addressed this problem is to avoid it. Eric Gartzke writes that cyberwar is a myth; policymakers have exaggerated the threat.⁵ Thomas Rid argues that the requirement for secrecy and anonymity prevents policymakers from using cyber weapons as tools of policy.⁶ Martin Libicki goes further, arguing that the fact that cyber weapons rely on deception makes it difficult to even theorize about how they might mesh with nations’ grand strategic goals.⁷ adversaries’ commerce or fomenting rebellion in opponents’ populations. Today, inverted militarized diplomacy is central to the three main methods states use to employ cyber weapons against each other. Over the last few years, the cyber strategies major powers have utilized have had a significant effect on global economics, politics and balances of power.\n# Weapons Technology and Inverted Militarized Diplomacy. Over the last few decades, a good deal of work has explored how states use weapons to bargain. In the simplest model of bargaining, when an initiator desires a good held by a target, it makes a demand backed by the threat of force. When a target receives the demand, Georgetown Journal of International Affairs ANDRES Military Matters it must decide whether to resist or comply. If it resists, the initiator must choose whether to go through with the threat. When the target believes the initiator's threat is credible and that it can impose costs greater than the cost of losing the disputed good, it will concede. If the target believes the threat is a bluff or that the initiator does not have sufficient military capacity to impose costs greater than the value of the disputed good, it will resist.⁸ An interesting line of research into militarized diplomacy involves weapons technology and tactics. A highly scrutinized phenomenon involves the difference between bargaining with conventional and nuclear weapons. For states bargaining with conventional weapons, the classic problem involves how to make threats credible, since both states have incentives to exaggerate the strengths of their military power. The traditional solution is to publicly display capabilities either statically or on the battlefield in limited wars. While talk is cheap, displays are harder to misrepresent. When states make demands backed by conventional weapons, the threats generally must be attributable and there is an incentive to display the military capabilities that is being used to carry out both deterrent and compellent threats.⁹ There are substantial similarities between the way states bargain with conventional and nuclear weapons. There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness. To overcome this problem, states attempt to build artificial irrationality into their bureaucratic systems and otherwise increase their opponents' perception that they are willing to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances. States employ tripwire deployments of troops, hair-trigger forces, autonomous battlefield nuclear weapons and other schemes to increase the chances that a state would use nuclear weapons even when doing so might lead to general war and mutually assured destruction.¹⁰ While diplomacy involving conventional and nuclear weapons relies on overt displays and attributable threats, there are classes of weapons and tactics that work best when this process is inverted; however, this type of militarized bargaining has received little attention in the bargaining literature. In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario, International Engagement on Cyber IV [121] the initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future. It differs from a brute force strategy in that the initiator does not forgo diplomacy; rather it uses diplomacy to prevent the target from retaliating. Traditionally, diplomats use this strategy to lower the chances of reprisal by lowering the target's expectations about the utility of retaliation and escalation. This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation.\nFor practical reasons, some types of weapons and tactics facilitate inverted militarized diplomacy and some do not; four characteristics tend to increase the utility of a military technology for this purpose. First, technology and techniques that allow military force to be used without attribution (or at least provide plausible deniability) increase its utility. Second, methods that permit forces to seize goods with high political or economic value make the approach more attractive. Third, less socially provocative weapons and tactics are more conducive to the inverted bargaining approach; for instance, if a state fired a cruise missile to destroy a factory, most observers would consider the act more provocative than if the state employed a computer virus to accomplish the same end. Finally, the approach works best when the initiator perceives an asymmetrical opportunity to use force; that is, when the initiator has the opportunity to take something from the target by force but the target cannot easily respond in kind. Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu ANDRES Military Matters larly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps both the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.[14] The dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in International Engagement on Cyber IV [123] retaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17 ## Fomenting Revolution A second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is ANDRES Military Matters easily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³ While this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile. The industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure that controls most grids globally are poorly protected and difficult to defend. Against a country like the United States, a military launching a full scale attack on an electric # The dilemma for [intellectual property]-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in retaliation.\nlution or coup in Russia or China has the potential to lead to unintended consequences such as global financial turmoil or loose nuclear weapons.\n## Critical infrastructure sabotage.\nA third way states are employing cyber weapons involves sabotaging opponents' critical infrastructure. Over the last four years, U.S. Directors of National Intelligence have repeatedly described this as the foremost item in their annual threat assessments to the Senate.²² These types of attacks are sometimes described as capable of creating a Cyber Pearl Harbor. Just as Russian and Chinese leaders describe fomenting rebelgrid would most likely use malware to attempt to destroy hardware such as ultrahigh voltage transformers and large generators that require months or years to replace. While it would be difficult to accomplish, a fully successful attack could result in millions of deaths and national economic paralysis.²⁵ A state might be willing to launch this type of attack if it believed it had no other options; for instance, if its regime were about to fall to conventional attack. A state might also launch a smaller attack with the goal of causing economic loss and military debilitation. Attackers might see this second type of action as operating below the threshold International Engagement on Cyber IV [125] INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY that would invite massive retaliation by its opponent's military.²⁶ Over the last year, a large proportion of electric companies around the globe have reported finding malware in the systems that control their hardware.²⁷ Critical infrastructure sabotage has asymmetrical political value in that prevent reprisal. Beyond this, a key element that makes this bargaining strategy successful involves social conventions about cyberspace; if opponents buried physical bombs under transformers and generators it is more likely that populations and policymakers would feel compelled to retaliate.\n# [Sabotaging critical infrastructure] is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\ndeveloped economies are often more dependent on critical infrastructure than less developed states. When the power goes out in most rich countries, within seconds economic transactions and communication stop working and within hours electricity dependent water and fuel stop flowing. Developing nations tend to be less dependent on electricity.

    "# Inverted-Militarized-Diplomacy\n\n## How States Bargain with Cyber Weapons\n\nRichard B. Andres\n\nWhile a great deal of work examines how states use conventional and nuclear weapons in militarized interstate bargaining, little work has examined how states bargain with cyber weapons to further their national interests. The few authors who take on this question conclude that it is difficult or even impossible to bargain with weapons that work best when they are secret and not attributable. This approach is mistaken. With cyber weapons, states regularly employ an inverted militarized bargaining method in which, rather than making demands backed by threats, policymakers use military assets to seize what they want while relying on diplomats to prevent reprisal and escalation.\n\nIn recent years, militaries have increased their spending on cyber weapons and become more active in placing offensive malware in their adversaries' systems. As these capabilities have proliferated, leaders from various countries have warned that cyber warfare can now cause harm on par with conventional weapons.¹ Nevertheless, the increase in the military use of the cyber domain has not been accompanied by much academic discussion about the diplomatic bargaining strategies that accompany these armaments.²\n\nPart of the problem scholars have with writing about\n\nRichard B. Andres is Professor of National Security Strategy at the U.S. National War College, focusing on cyber, aerospace, and energy. Previously, he was Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Air Force and has led teams developing strategy for the White House, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and other combatant commands.\n\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [119]",
    "INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY\n\ncyber strategy is that cyber diplomacy does not fit well into existing models of militarized bargaining. Standard bargaining models of war posit that states deploy weapons in order to increase their diplomatic leverage over other states.³ National leaders display their military capabilities to deter or compel their adversaries. Unlike most conventional arms, however, cyber weapons often become less operationally effective when they cease to be secret and when they can be attributed to a specific attacker. Thus the paradox: when a state\n\nThe current theoretical understanding of cyber diplomacy is unsatisfying. The argument that secret and anonymous weapons cannot be used to achieve political goals is inaccurate. States regularly use secret and anonymous military power in conjunction with diplomacy using a technique I term inverted militarized diplomacy, in which states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation. Historically, this method has been used most often by nations employing pirates against\n\n# Using inverted militarized diplomacy, states use plausibly deniable military power to seize desired goods while using diplomacy to prevent retaliation and escalation.\n\nmakes its cyber threats transparent in order to advance diplomatic ends, it renders its cyber capabilities less operationally potent and thus diplomatically less useful. In short, diplomatic threats that reveal cyber weapons tend to nullify themselves.⁴\n\nThe main way the international relations literature has addressed this problem is to avoid it. Eric Gartzke writes that cyberwar is a myth; policymakers have exaggerated the threat.⁵ Thomas Rid argues that the requirement for secrecy and anonymity prevents policymakers from using cyber weapons as tools of policy.⁶ Martin Libicki goes further, arguing that the fact that cyber weapons rely on deception makes it difficult to even theorize about how they might mesh with nations’ grand strategic goals.⁷\n\nadversaries’ commerce or fomenting rebellion in opponents’ populations. Today, inverted militarized diplomacy is central to the three main methods states use to employ cyber weapons against each other. Over the last few years, the cyber strategies major powers have utilized have had a significant effect on global economics, politics and balances of power.\n\n# Weapons Technology and Inverted Militarized Diplomacy. Over the last few decades, a good deal of work has explored how states use weapons to bargain. In the simplest model of bargaining, when an initiator desires a good held by a target, it makes a demand backed by the threat of force. When a target receives the demand,\n\nGeorgetown Journal of International Affairs",
    "ANDRES Military Matters\n\nit must decide whether to resist or comply. If it resists, the initiator must choose whether to go through with the threat. When the target believes the initiator's threat is credible and that it can impose costs greater than the cost of losing the disputed good, it will concede. If the target believes the threat is a bluff or that the initiator does not have sufficient military capacity to impose costs greater than the value of the disputed good, it will resist.⁸\n\nAn interesting line of research into militarized diplomacy involves weapons technology and tactics. A highly scrutinized phenomenon involves the difference between bargaining with conventional and nuclear weapons. For states bargaining with conventional weapons, the classic problem involves how to make threats credible, since both states have incentives to exaggerate the strengths of their military power. The traditional solution is to publicly display capabilities either statically or on the battlefield in limited wars. While talk is cheap, displays are harder to misrepresent. When states make demands backed by conventional weapons, the threats generally must be attributable and there is an incentive to display the military capabilities that is being used to carry out both deterrent and compellent threats.⁹\n\nThere are substantial similarities between the way states bargain with conventional and nuclear weapons. There is, however, an important difference. In nuclear bargaining, the threat of escalation to general war is inherently incredible since both actors know that the costs of such a war would eclipse whatever gains an initiator might gain by winning. In this type of bargaining, once both states have the ability to destroy the other, their relative capacity becomes largely unimportant. This significantly reduces states' incentive to statically display their nuclear capacity and particularly to display it in combat. In this situation, the diplomatic task becomes one of displaying risk acceptance rather than military power. A state with hundreds of weapons and a reputation for irrationality would likely have a bargaining advantage over a state with thousands of weapons but a reputation for reasonableness. To overcome this problem, states attempt to build artificial irrationality into their bureaucratic systems and otherwise increase their opponents' perception that they are willing to use nuclear weapons under specific circumstances. States employ tripwire deployments of troops, hair-trigger forces, autonomous battlefield nuclear weapons and other schemes to increase the chances that a state would use nuclear weapons even when doing so might lead to general war and mutually assured destruction.¹⁰\n\nWhile diplomacy involving conventional and nuclear weapons relies on overt displays and attributable threats, there are classes of weapons and tactics that work best when this process is inverted; however, this type of militarized bargaining has received little attention in the bargaining literature. In inverted militarized diplomacy, the initiator begins an interaction with a target by using its military capability to seize what it wants by force and fraud rather than by demanding that the target concede the good. This technique puts the target in a position where it must either escalate or accept the new status quo. In this type of scenario,\n\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [121]",
    "the initiator's diplomatic goal is to prevent escalation and reprisal. This approach differs from a simple fait accompli strategy in that it can describe persistent military operations that are occurring coeval to diplomatic activity and can be expected to continue into the future. It differs from a brute force strategy in that the initiator does not forgo diplomacy; rather it uses diplomacy to prevent the target from retaliating. Traditionally, diplomats use this strategy to lower the chances of reprisal by lowering the target's expectations about the utility of retaliation and escalation. This often involves efforts to decrease the target's certainty about the identity of the attacker, to lower the target's estimation of the value of the thing being purloined, or to increase the target's assessment of the cost of escalation.\n\nFor practical reasons, some types of weapons and tactics facilitate inverted militarized diplomacy and some do not; four characteristics tend to increase the utility of a military technology for this purpose. First, technology and techniques that allow military force to be used without attribution (or at least provide plausible deniability) increase its utility. Second, methods that permit forces to seize goods with high political or economic value make the approach more attractive. Third, less socially provocative weapons and tactics are more conducive to the inverted bargaining approach; for instance, if a state fired a cruise missile to destroy a factory, most observers would consider the act more provocative than if the state employed a computer virus to accomplish the same end. Finally, the approach works best when the initiator perceives an asymmetrical opportunity to use force; that is, when the initiator has the opportunity to take something from the target by force but the target cannot easily respond in kind. Across history, the utility of the inverted approach has waxed and waned with the rise and fall of various types of military and economic technology and changing perceptions about the meaning of different types of military action.\n\nWhile there are many examples of technologies and tactics that states have used with inverted militarized diplomacy, the two best known examples are state-sponsored piracy and state-promoted insurgency. How effective these methods are depends, to a large extent, on the technology of the day. In the sixteenth century, Elizabeth I of England sponsored pirates to attack Spanish shipping. The stratagem was attractive because the maritime and financial technology of day enabled un-attributable pirate ships to steal vast sums in bullion (enriching sponsoring states and weakening rivals) and because pirate-states could act without positive attribution. In this interaction, Spain could not retaliate in kind because England did not have similarly exposed supply lines (vulnerable treasure convoys from the New World). Through astute diplomacy, Elizabeth was able to defer conventional retaliation for decades.\n\nStates have also used inverted militarized diplomacy to foment insurgency in opponents' populations. One of the best known examples involves the Cold War interaction between the United States and the Soviet Union and their client states. During the early years of the Cold War, the Soviet Union regu",
    "ANDRES Military Matters\n\nlarly supported violent people's movements in non-communist nations. The strategy was effective because of a confluence of technologies and social conditions. Originally, the strategy was attractive because it did not appear that the United States could respond in kind. The Soviet Union depended on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability, and playing with nuclear thresholds to prevent the United States from escalating. The strategy eventually lost its value when, in the 1980s, the United States began promoting anti-communist insurgencies in Nicaragua and Afghanistan, and successful dissident movements in other countries, including the Soviet Union itself.\n\nCyber weapons and militarized diplomacy. In the cyber age, states are maneuvering to find ways to use weaponized software to further national interests. So far, the half dozen or so cyber-powers have gravitated toward three main strategic activities: piracy of intellectual property, fomenting of revolution, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. Each of these approaches relies on a combination of secrecy, disguised attribution, and inverted diplomacy.\n\nPiracy of intellectual property. The first way states utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy involves piracy of intellectual property (IP). Throughout history, international law and custom governing espionage have been ambiguous. For the most part, the law remains silent concerning the theft of state secrets. This norm has evolved for a number of technical and practical reasons. Notably, espionage often helps\n\nboth the spying and spied-on nations. Inaccurate information is one of the most common causes of war. Bilateral espionage can reduce the chances violence. Similarly, IP piracy is seldom considered as serious as stealing tangible goods. In countries such as China, there is not a strong norm against it. Beyond these issues, the harm spying can do has traditionally been reduced by the cost of placing spies and their limited ability to exfiltrate information. Thus, while states regularly complain about foreign spies operating on their soil, these protests seldom amount to casus billis.\n\nThe problem with new cyber espionage technology is that it radically changes the cost-benefit tradeoff for spying. While placing a human agent often requires large investments for small rewards, cyber spying costs little and regularly produces massive payoffs. By conservative estimates, IP theft costs the United States around 375 billion dollars each year, around 2 million jobs, with China responsible for most of the loss.[14]\n\nThe dynamics of cyber IP piracy are similar to those of high seas piracy during the Elizabethan period. Over the last two decades, the developed world, and the United States in particular, has increasingly outsourced its production of physical goods to Asia, turning to a business model based on developing IP. As the value of IP has burgeoned, pirate-states, and China in particular, have used their militaries' cyber resources to steal it. The dilemma for IP-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in\n\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [123]",
    "retaliation. Diplomatically, the cyber pirate-states face the same challenge as Elizabeth. The sums being won and lost through piracy rise to the level of national policy and, at least in the case of China, are helping to change regional balances of economic and military power toward the pirate-states.15 Pirate-states attempt to prevent retaliation and escalation through secrecy, misinformation, plausible denial, and other diplomatic means.16 The main risk their leaders face is that, like Elizabeth, they will eventually misjudge Western thresholds for reprisal in a game with which neither side has much experience.17\n\n## Fomenting Revolution\n\nA second way states use cyber weapons as tools of policy involves encouraging revolution. Like espionage, external support for dissidents has traditionally inhabited a gray area in international law and custom. States encouraging revolutions often see their actions not only as politically useful, but as morally right. This was certainly the case with republican France, Soviet communism, and modern liberal democracy.\n\nFor the last few years, Western states, and particularly the United States, have used cyber tools to undermine repressive autocratic regimes. Most policymakers in democratic states probably do not see these actions as fomenting rebellions so much as supporting freedom. In a landmark speech in 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laid out U.S. cyber policy as morally obliged to break down the information barriers autocratic regimes erect against cyber freedom.18 Congress has funded this mission and various U.S. departments and agencies have supported it by developing and distributing anonymizing software designed to allow dissidents in autocratic countries to communicate and coordinate their actions.19 Western-supplied social media, anonymizing software, and virtual private networks (VPN) have contributed to movements that have overthrown regimes in Tunisia, Egypt (twice), Libya, and Ukraine and threatened governments in Iran, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain, and Iraq.20 Russia and China have both regularly declared the U.S. cyber openness efforts to be recklessly offensive and, China in particular, has spent vast sums developing the so called Great Firewall of China to prevent dissidents from coordinating via electronic means. China has reason to worry as it has spent almost as many years in civil war as not over past two centuries and its civil wars have often cost it millions of lives.\n\nFrom the perspective of international relations and diplomacy, the dynamics behind current Western efforts to use cyber tools to help dissidents coordinate their actions are similar to the early twentieth century attempts by the Soviet Union to encourage revolution. The West and the United States in particular, has been able to pursue this policy with impunity because democracies appear to be immune to the negative effects that this technology poses for regime stability and, consequently, its autocratic rivals cannot retaliate in kind. The diplomatic goal of the West is to prevent escalation and retaliation by other means. It does this by playing up the moral imperative behind freedom of information and playing down its own role in providing software, which is",
    "ANDRES Military Matters\n\neasily done because private groups take on this role without need for encouragement. For their part, repressive states seek to blame Western powers for their dissident movements while seeking treaties that limit Western action on their networks.²¹ The main risk the West faces by promoting this policy is that it will work. For instance, the current Western supported civil war in Syria weakened the regime and thereby helped a rebel army, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to mobilize, invade and conquer a large part of U.S. supported Iraq; the Western friendly coup that displaced the Russian friendly government in Ukraine motivated Russia to invade Crimea and Eastern Ukraine with irregular forces. A revolution in their populations as their greatest fear, U.S. leaders describe critical infrastructure sabotage as theirs.²³\n\nWhile this type of malware can threaten military systems and various types of civilian infrastructure, the greatest threat it possesses is to national electrical grids because all other critical infrastructures depend on electricity.²⁴ In many countries, including the United States, electric grids are old, complex, and fragile. The industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure that controls most grids globally are poorly protected and difficult to defend. Against a country like the United States, a military launching a full scale attack on an electric\n\n# The dilemma for [intellectual property]-producing nations is much the same as that faced by sixteenth century Spain: the states doing most of the pirating do not have much that can be pirated in retaliation.\n\nlution or coup in Russia or China has the potential to lead to unintended consequences such as global financial turmoil or loose nuclear weapons.\n\n## Critical infrastructure sabotage.\n\nA third way states are employing cyber weapons involves sabotaging opponents' critical infrastructure. Over the last four years, U.S. Directors of National Intelligence have repeatedly described this as the foremost item in their annual threat assessments to the Senate.²² These types of attacks are sometimes described as capable of creating a Cyber Pearl Harbor. Just as Russian and Chinese leaders describe fomenting rebel-\n\ngrid would most likely use malware to attempt to destroy hardware such as ultrahigh voltage transformers and large generators that require months or years to replace. While it would be difficult to accomplish, a fully successful attack could result in millions of deaths and national economic paralysis.²⁵ A state might be willing to launch this type of attack if it believed it had no other options; for instance, if its regime were about to fall to conventional attack. A state might also launch a smaller attack with the goal of causing economic loss and military debilitation. Attackers might see this second type of action as operating below the threshold\n\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [125]",
    "INVERTED-MILITARIZED-DIPLOMACY\n\nthat would invite massive retaliation by its opponent's military.²⁶ Over the last year, a large proportion of electric companies around the globe have reported finding malware in the systems that control their hardware.²⁷\n\nCritical infrastructure sabotage has asymmetrical political value in that\n\nprevent reprisal. Beyond this, a key element that makes this bargaining strategy successful involves social conventions about cyberspace; if opponents buried physical bombs under transformers and generators it is more likely that populations and policymakers would feel compelled to retaliate.\n\n# [Sabotaging critical infrastructure] is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\n\ndeveloped economies are often more dependent on critical infrastructure than less developed states. When the power goes out in most rich countries, within seconds economic transactions and communication stop working and within hours electricity dependent water and fuel stop flowing. Developing nations tend to be less dependent on electricity. More importantly, though, this type of weapon is a way for states without global power projection capability to harm their distant opponents without spending trillions of dollars on bases, bombers, and aircraft carriers.\n\nLike the methods of cyber-attack described earlier, critical infrastructure sabotage employs a form of inverted diplomacy. States that place malware on opponents' systems without activating it do so to increase their military power. Rather than making diplomatic demands backed by cyber-weapons, their militaries emplace their weapons in their opponents' territory by stealth and fraud. Diplomatically, attackers rely on a combination of secrecy, plausible deniability and lack of precedent to\n\nThe sabotage strategy carries a number of difficulties and risks. These weapons and techniques are challenging to develop; conducting the kind of virtual Pearl Harbor U.S. policymakers warn about would be tough. Even if a state had the capability, the weapons would be unreliable because an attacker would not know if the defender had neutralized the malware in the months or years it lay dormant waiting for the signal to detonate.²⁸ Moreover, sending potentially devastating malware into the wild is dangerous both because discovered-malware can be reverse engineered and because of the possibility that malware resident on critical infrastructure might detonate through error or accident.²⁹ In short, this approach is risky but a number of states appear to believe the potential it offers to gain global power projection capability on the cheap is worth the risk.\n\nConclusion. The above analysis described the logic behind the three main ways states are using offensive cyber weapons. States use these arms\n\n[126] Georgetown Journal of International Affairs",
    "ANDRES Military Matters\n\nto achieve political objectives by force and fraud, and then use diplomatic efforts to prevent retaliation and escalation. This reverses the model political scientists are accustomed to, in which militarized interactions begin with diplomats making threats about the potential future use of force. The literature is mistaken in arguing that states cannot utilize cyber weapons as tools of policy. Just as nuclear weapons require bargaining strategies somewhat different from conventional weapons, cyber weapons require an approach somewhat different from either conventional or nuclear diplomacy. Policymakers and generals around the world are using this model to achieve their foreign policy objectives.\n\nInternational Engagement on Cyber IV [127]",
