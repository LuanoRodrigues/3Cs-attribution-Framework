The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences.⁵⁵ Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.⁵⁶\nToday's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily.⁵⁷ At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.⁵⁸\nIt is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures.⁵⁹ An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations,⁶⁰ a wave of attacks that\n⁵⁵ Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\" securitybrief.co.nz=\"\" story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁶ Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\" time.com=\"\" y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁷ Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\" 16=\"\" 2023=\"\" politics=\"\" what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁸ Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\" hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\" world=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁹ Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\" securityintelligence.com=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶⁰ Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\" feature=\"\" www.techtarget.com=\"\" whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:>\ncost a city 775 million dollars only in a year,⁶¹ a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages.⁶² These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures,⁶³ international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace,⁶⁴ and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms.⁶⁵ This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n⁶¹ Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶² Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶³ See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union [2022] OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n⁶⁴ UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

The no-harm- due diligence duo: A rule(s) for all seasons?\nThe obligation to prevent transboundary harm (alternatively the no-harm principle) has been formulated in the Trail Smelter Arbitration⁶⁶ and was considered customary international law by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Corfu Channel case⁶⁷, a conclusion which has been reaffirmed in the Pulp Mills and the Certain Activities in the Border Area cases.⁶⁸ According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses)⁶⁹ and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards,⁷⁰ and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ⁷¹ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)⁷² and has been accepted as a general principle of law.⁷³ There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion.⁷⁴ Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace. This application would\n⁶⁶ Trail Smelter Case (United States of America v.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n75 Trail Smelter (n 66); Corfu Channel Case (n 67).\n76 Nedeski N, Sparks T, and Hernandez GI, 'The World Is Burning, Urgently And Irreparably: A Plea for Interim Protection against Climatic Change at the ICJ' (2023) 22(2) The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 301; Maljean-Dubois S, 'The No-Harm Principle and the Foundation of International Climate Change Law' in Benoit Mayer and Alexander Zahar (eds) Debating Climate Law (CUP, 2021), pp. 15–20.\n77 Karageorgou V, 'The Environmental Integration Principle in EU Law: Normative Content and Function also in Light of New Developments, such as the European Green Deal' (2023) 8(1) European Papers 159.\n78 ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', First Report, (2014); ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', Second Report (2016).\n79 Schmitt M, 'In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (2015-2016) 125 The Yale Law Journal Forum 68; Efrony D, Shany Y, 'A Rule Book on the Shelf?

However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology.[81] Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm.[82] Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'.[83] This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.[84]\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm.[85] However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier.[86] Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences.[87] Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n[81] Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n[82] Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n[83] Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n[84] Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n[85] ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n[86] Ibid.\n[87] ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n28\nand opinio juris, it can be argued that the no-harm principle can encompass cases of non-physical harm and thus apply to cyber operations.\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms.⁸⁸ However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm.⁸⁹ Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge,⁹⁰ others that also support a duty to react,⁹¹ and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.'⁹² On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes⁹³ while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.⁹⁴\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).⁹⁵\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n⁸⁸ Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n⁸⁹ ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n⁹⁰ Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n⁹¹ Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

And lastly, taking into account that the most vulnerable targets tend to be their critical infrastructures, states will rush to fortify them fostering thus a new culture for cybersecurity.\n## 2. The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n96 ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

In the cyber age, these ideas of coercion create some difficult challenges. For example, what is the required magnitude of coercion? Is absolute loss of control required, or can it be partial? What if an initial act of influence or interference sets in motion a series of circumstances that deprives the victim State of authority over a particular matter?\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold¹⁰⁸ or reformulating it¹⁰⁹ in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion.¹¹⁰ Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination).¹¹¹ An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state.¹¹² This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention.¹¹³ This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n¹⁰⁷ Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.¹¹⁴\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.¹¹⁵ The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'.¹¹⁶ Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet.¹¹⁷ Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.¹¹⁸\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé.¹¹⁹ In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié.

International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied.

Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n¹²² Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281.",
  "flat_text": "By Triantafyllos Kouloufakos (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven)\n## Introduction\nThere was a time when the words cyber-attack had a degree of mystification on them. The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences. Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.\nToday's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily. At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.\nIt is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures. An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations, a wave of attacks that\n Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\" securitybrief.co.nz=\"\" story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\" time.com=\"\" y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\" 16=\"\" 2023=\"\" politics=\"\" what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\" hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\" world=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\" securityintelligence.com=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\" feature=\"\" www.techtarget.com=\"\" whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:>\ncost a city 775 million dollars only in a year, a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages. These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures, international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace, and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms. This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union [2022] OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses) and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards, and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and has been accepted as a general principle of law. There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion. Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n\n27</https:>\nSince cyberspace encompasses a series of unusual characteristics as a domain (e.g. a-territoriality, almost instant transmission of information) the no-harm principle cannot be applied as is. However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology.[81] Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm.[82] Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'.[83] This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.[84]\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm.[85] However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier.[86] Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences.[87] Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n[81] Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n[82] Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n[83] Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n[84] Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n[85] ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n[86] Ibid.\n[87] ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms. However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm. Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge, others that also support a duty to react, and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.' On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold or reformulating it in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion. Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination). An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state. This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention. This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'. The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'. Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet. Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé. In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle, would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'. Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change\n Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?'

This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.\n## Conclusion\nReflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281.",

    "## Introduction": "There was a time when the words cyber-attack had a degree of mystification on them. The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences.⁵⁵ Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.⁵⁶\nToday's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily.⁵⁷ At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.⁵⁸\nIt is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures.⁵⁹ An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations,⁶⁰ a wave of attacks that\n⁵⁵ Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\" securitybrief.co.nz=\"\" story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁶ Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\" time.com=\"\" y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁷ Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\" 16=\"\" 2023=\"\" politics=\"\" what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁸ Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\" hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\" world=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁹ Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\" securityintelligence.com=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶⁰ Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\" feature=\"\" www.techtarget.com=\"\" whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:>\ncost a city 775 million dollars only in a year,⁶¹ a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages.⁶² These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures,⁶³ international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace,⁶⁴ and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms.⁶⁵ This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n⁶¹ Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶² Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶³ See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union  OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n⁶⁴ UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

    "# 1. The no-harm- due diligence duo: A rule(s) for all seasons?": "The obligation to prevent transboundary harm (alternatively the no-harm principle) has been formulated in the Trail Smelter Arbitration⁶⁶ and was considered customary international law by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Corfu Channel case⁶⁷, a conclusion which has been reaffirmed in the Pulp Mills and the Certain Activities in the Border Area cases.⁶⁸ According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses)⁶⁹ and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards,⁷⁰ and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ⁷¹ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)⁷² and has been accepted as a general principle of law.⁷³ There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion.⁷⁴ Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace. This application would\n⁶⁶ Trail Smelter Case (United States of America v.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n75 Trail Smelter (n 66); Corfu Channel Case (n 67).\n76 Nedeski N, Sparks T, and Hernandez GI, 'The World Is Burning, Urgently And Irreparably: A Plea for Interim Protection against Climatic Change at the ICJ' (2023) 22(2) The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 301; Maljean-Dubois S, 'The No-Harm Principle and the Foundation of International Climate Change Law' in Benoit Mayer and Alexander Zahar (eds) Debating Climate Law (CUP, 2021), pp. 15–20.\n77 Karageorgou V, 'The Environmental Integration Principle in EU Law: Normative Content and Function also in Light of New Developments, such as the European Green Deal' (2023) 8(1) European Papers 159.\n78 ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', First Report, (2014); ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', Second Report (2016).\n79 Schmitt M, 'In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (2015-2016) 125 The Yale Law Journal Forum 68; Efrony D, Shany Y, 'A Rule Book on the Shelf?

However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology. Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm. Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'. This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm. However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier. Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences. Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n Ibid.\n ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n28\nand opinio juris, it can be argued that the no-harm principle can encompass cases of non-physical harm and thus apply to cyber operations.\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms.⁸⁸ However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm.⁸⁹ Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge,⁹⁰ others that also support a duty to react,⁹¹ and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.'⁹² On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes⁹³ while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.⁹⁴\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).⁹⁵\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n⁸⁸ Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n⁸⁹ ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n⁹⁰ Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n⁹¹ Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

And lastly, taking into account that the most vulnerable targets tend to be their critical infrastructures, states will rush to fortify them fostering thus a new culture for cybersecurity.",
    "## 2. The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution": "The non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n96 ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

In the cyber age, these ideas of coercion create some difficult challenges. For example, what is the required magnitude of coercion? Is absolute loss of control required, or can it be partial? What if an initial act of influence or interference sets in motion a series of circumstances that deprives the victim State of authority over a particular matter?\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold¹⁰⁸ or reformulating it¹⁰⁹ in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion.¹¹⁰ Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination).¹¹¹ An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state.¹¹² This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention.¹¹³ This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n¹⁰⁷ Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.¹¹⁴\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.¹¹⁵ The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'.¹¹⁶ Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet.¹¹⁷ Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.¹¹⁸\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé.¹¹⁹ In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle,¹²⁰ would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'.¹²¹ Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change\n¹¹⁴ Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?'

This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.",
    "## Conclusion": "Reflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n¹²² Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281."

The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences. Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.\nToday's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily. At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.\nIt is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures. An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations, a wave of attacks that\n Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\" securitybrief.co.nz=\"\" story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\" time.com=\"\" y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\" 16=\"\" 2023=\"\" politics=\"\" what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\" hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\" world=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\" securityintelligence.com=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\" feature=\"\" www.techtarget.com=\"\" whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:>\ncost a city 775 million dollars only in a year, a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages. These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures, international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace, and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms. This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union [2022] OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses) and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards, and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and has been accepted as a general principle of law. There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion. Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n\n27</https:>\nSince cyberspace encompasses a series of unusual characteristics as a domain (e.g. a-territoriality, almost instant transmission of information) the no-harm principle cannot be applied as is. However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology.[81] Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm.[82] Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'.[83] This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.[84]\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm.[85] However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier.[86] Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences.[87] Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n[81] Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n[82] Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n[83] Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n[84] Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n[85] ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n[86] Ibid.\n[87] ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms. However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm. Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge, others that also support a duty to react, and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.' On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold or reformulating it in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion. Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination). An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state. This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention. This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'. The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'. Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet. Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé. In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle, would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'. Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change\n Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?' (2012) 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 211, p. 212; Dinniss H H, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (CUP, 2012), p. 74.\n Nicaragua Case (n 96), para 205.\n Ibid.\n Schmitt M, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 Yale Journal of International Law 1.\n Ibid.\n Kilovaty, 'The international law of cyber intervention' (n 107), p. 103.\n Higgins R, Themes and Theories, (OUP, 2009), pp. 799–810.\n Moulin T, 'Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace: The Path Forward' (2020) 25(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law, p. 437.\n\nAs with coercion, the latter of the aforementioned contentions, which is based on an effects approach, seems to be the best fit for cyberspace particularities. This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.\n## Conclusion\nReflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281.",

The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences. Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.\nToday's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily. At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.\nIt is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures. An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations, a wave of attacks that\n Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\" securitybrief.co.nz=\"\" story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\" time.com=\"\" y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\" 16=\"\" 2023=\"\" politics=\"\" what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\" hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\" world=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\" securityintelligence.com=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\" feature=\"\" www.techtarget.com=\"\" whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:>\ncost a city 775 million dollars only in a year, a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages. These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures, international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace, and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms. This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union [2022] OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses) and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards, and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) and has been accepted as a general principle of law. There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion. Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n\n27</https:>\nSince cyberspace encompasses a series of unusual characteristics as a domain (e.g. a-territoriality, almost instant transmission of information) the no-harm principle cannot be applied as is. However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology.[81] Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm.[82] Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'.[83] This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.[84]\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm.[85] However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier.[86] Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences.[87] Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n[81] Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n[82] Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n[83] Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n[84] Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n[85] ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n[86] Ibid.\n[87] ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms. However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm. Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge, others that also support a duty to react, and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.' On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold or reformulating it in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion. Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination). An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state. This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention. This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'. The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'. Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet. Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé. In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle, would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'. Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change\n Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?'

This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.\n## Conclusion\nReflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281."

The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences.⁵⁵ Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.⁵⁶\nToday's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily.⁵⁷ At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.⁵⁸\nIt is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures.⁵⁹ An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations,⁶⁰ a wave of attacks that\n⁵⁵ Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\" securitybrief.co.nz=\"\" story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁶ Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\" time.com=\"\" y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁷ Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\" 16=\"\" 2023=\"\" politics=\"\" what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" www.washingtonpost.com=\"\" politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁸ Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\" hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\" world=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁹ Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\" securityintelligence.com=\"\" news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶⁰ Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\" feature=\"\" www.techtarget.com=\"\" whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:>\ncost a city 775 million dollars only in a year,⁶¹ a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages.⁶² These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures,⁶³ international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace,⁶⁴ and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms.⁶⁵ This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n⁶¹ Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶² Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶³ See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union  OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n⁶⁴ UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

The no-harm- due diligence duo: A rule(s) for all seasons?\nThe obligation to prevent transboundary harm (alternatively the no-harm principle) has been formulated in the Trail Smelter Arbitration⁶⁶ and was considered customary international law by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Corfu Channel case⁶⁷, a conclusion which has been reaffirmed in the Pulp Mills and the Certain Activities in the Border Area cases.⁶⁸ According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses)⁶⁹ and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards,⁷⁰ and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ⁷¹ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)⁷² and has been accepted as a general principle of law.⁷³ There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion.⁷⁴ Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n75 Trail Smelter (n 66); Corfu Channel Case (n 67).\n76 Nedeski N, Sparks T, and Hernandez GI, 'The World Is Burning, Urgently And Irreparably: A Plea for Interim Protection against Climatic Change at the ICJ' (2023) 22(2) The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 301; Maljean-Dubois S, 'The No-Harm Principle and the Foundation of International Climate Change Law' in Benoit Mayer and Alexander Zahar (eds) Debating Climate Law (CUP, 2021), pp. 15–20.\n77 Karageorgou V, 'The Environmental Integration Principle in EU Law: Normative Content and Function also in Light of New Developments, such as the European Green Deal' (2023) 8(1) European Papers 159.\n78 ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', First Report, (2014); ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', Second Report (2016).\n79 Schmitt M, 'In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (2015-2016) 125 The Yale Law Journal Forum 68; Efrony D, Shany Y, 'A Rule Book on the Shelf?

However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology. Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm. Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'. This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm. However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier. Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences. Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n Ibid.\n ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n28\nand opinio juris, it can be argued that the no-harm principle can encompass cases of non-physical harm and thus apply to cyber operations.\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms.⁸⁸ However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm.⁸⁹ Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge,⁹⁰ others that also support a duty to react,⁹¹ and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.'⁹² On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes⁹³ while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.⁹⁴\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).⁹⁵\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n⁸⁸ Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n⁸⁹ ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n⁹⁰ Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n⁹¹ Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

And lastly, taking into account that the most vulnerable targets tend to be their critical infrastructures, states will rush to fortify them fostering thus a new culture for cybersecurity.\n## 2. The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n96 ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

In the cyber age, these ideas of coercion create some difficult challenges. For example, what is the required magnitude of coercion? Is absolute loss of control required, or can it be partial? What if an initial act of influence or interference sets in motion a series of circumstances that deprives the victim State of authority over a particular matter?\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold¹⁰⁸ or reformulating it¹⁰⁹ in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion.¹¹⁰ Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination).¹¹¹ An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state.¹¹² This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention.¹¹³ This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n¹⁰⁷ Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.¹¹⁴\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.¹¹⁵ The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'.¹¹⁶ Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet.¹¹⁷ Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.¹¹⁸\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé.¹¹⁹ In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle,¹²⁰ would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'.¹²¹ Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change\n¹¹⁴ Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?'

This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.\n## Conclusion\nReflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n¹²² Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281."

      "flat_text": "By Triantafyllos Kouloufakos (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) ## Introduction There was a time when the words cyber-attack had a degree of mystification on them. The early 2000s provided us with a series of cyber operations, all with increasingly serious consequences.⁵⁵ Nevertheless, twenty years ago, a cyber-attack was something worthy of news, albeit news that were not very approachable to a layman. Words like cyber worm or cyber malware were just starting to lose the fabled status that they held during the 80's and 90's, but again only just. A cyber-attack was something extremely important, something that warranted invited computer specialists in everyday news to analyze and soothe the masses that were just recovering from the Y2K scare.⁵⁶ Today's news though, tell a different story. We have come to expect at least two or three segments of every major news site to be about a malicious cyber operation and its very serious consequence. The current conflicts in Ukraine, and very recently in Gaza, have exacerbated this. From the start of Russia's invasion, news about cyber-attacks and the opposing cyber armies, flood the news almost daily.⁵⁷ At the point of this introduction being written, the crisis in Gaza has been on for almost a week and there are already news articles about cyber operations to aid and relief groups in Gaza.⁵⁸ It is reasonable that we have become desensitized to cyber-attacks, which is certainly dire. Offensive cyber operations become more complicated and more catastrophic by the day and unfortunately, they have been increasingly targeting critical infrastructures.⁵⁹ An energy pipeline which creates hours of car lines in gas stations,⁶⁰ a wave of attacks that ⁵⁵ Forrester N, 'A brief history of cyber-threats – from 2000 to 2020' (Security Brief, 12 January 2021) <https: a-brief-history-of-cyber-threats-from-2000-to-2020=\"\"securitybrief.co.nz=\"\"story=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁶ Uenuma F, '20 Years Later, the Y2K Bug Seems Like a Joke–Because Those Behind the Scenes Took It Seriously' (Time, 30 December 2019) <https: 5752129=\"\"time.com=\"\"y2k-bug-history=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁷ Starks T, 'What we've learned from a year of Russian cyberattacks in Ukraine' (Washington Post, 16 February 2023) <https: 02=\"\"16=\"\"2023=\"\"politics=\"\"what-we-learned-year-russian-cyberattacks-ukrai=\"\"www.washingtonpost.com=\"\"www.washingtonpost.com=\"\"politics=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁸ Siddiqui Z, 'Hackers hit aid groups responding to Israel and Gaza crisis' (Reuters, 13 October 2023) <https: middle-east=\"\"hackers-hit-aid-groups-responding-israel-gaza-crisis-2023-10-13=\"\"world=\"\"www.reuters.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁵⁹ Reed J, 'High-impact attacks on critical infrastructure climb 140%' (Security Intelligence, 26 June 2023) <https: high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140=\"\"securityintelligence.com=\"\"news=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶⁰ Kerner SM, 'Colonial Pipeline hack explained: Everything you need to know' (TechTarget, 26 April 2022) <https: kolonial-pipeline-hack-explained-everything-you-need-to-know=\"\"feature=\"\"www.techtarget.com=\"\"whatis=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.</https:></https:> cost a city 775 million dollars only in a year,⁶¹ a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages.⁶² These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures,⁶³ international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace,⁶⁴ and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms.⁶⁵ This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n⁶¹ Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\"statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶² Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\"18=\"\"2021=\"\"edition.cnn.com=\"\"business=\"\"cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\"index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶³ See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union [2022] OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n⁶⁴ UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses)⁶⁹ and has been developed extensively within this context.\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards,⁷⁰ and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ⁷¹ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)⁷² and has been accepted as a general principle of law.⁷³ There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a\"duty\",\"obligation\",\"principle\"and\"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion.⁷⁴ Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace.

If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n\n27</https:> Since cyberspace encompasses a series of unusual characteristics as a domain (e.g. a-territoriality, almost instant transmission of information) the no-harm principle cannot be applied as is. However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology.[81] Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm.[82] Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'.[83] This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.[84] The second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm.[85] However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier.[86] Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences.[87] Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice [81] Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n[82] Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law, 181.\n[83] Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n[84] Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n[85] ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n[86] Ibid.\n[87] ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms.⁸⁸ However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm.⁸⁹ Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge,⁹⁰ others that also support a duty to react,⁹¹ and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.'⁹² On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes⁹³ while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.⁹⁴ In my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).⁹⁵ To conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful ⁸⁸ Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n⁸⁹ ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n⁹⁰ Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n⁹¹ Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold¹⁰⁸ or reformulating it¹⁰⁹ in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion.¹¹⁰ Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination).¹¹¹ An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state.¹¹² This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention.¹¹³ This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would ¹⁰⁷ Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M,\"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.¹¹⁴ The second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.¹¹⁵ The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'.¹¹⁶ Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet.¹¹⁷ Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.¹¹⁸ Furthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé.¹¹⁹ In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle,¹²⁰ would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'.¹²¹ Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change ¹¹⁴ Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?' (2012) 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 211, p. 212; Dinniss H H, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War, p. 74.\n¹¹⁵ Nicaragua Case (n 96), para 205.\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n¹¹⁷ Schmitt M, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 Yale Journal of International Law 1.\n¹¹⁸ Ibid.\n¹¹⁹ Kilovaty, 'The international law of cyber intervention' (n 107), p. 103.\n¹²⁰ Higgins R, Themes and Theories,, pp. 799–810.\n¹²¹ Moulin T, 'Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace: The Path Forward' (2020) 25(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law, p. 437.\n\nAs with coercion, the latter of the aforementioned contentions, which is based on an effects approach, seems to be the best fit for cyberspace particularities. This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.\n## Conclusion Reflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n¹²² Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281."

However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures,⁶³ international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace,⁶⁴ and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms.⁶⁵ This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n⁶¹ Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶² Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n⁶³ See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union  OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n⁶⁴ UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

    "cost a city 775 million dollars only in a year,⁶¹ a cheese distribution center which creates massive product shortages.⁶² These are all recent examples of critical infrastructures being targeted by cyber-attacks and the ominous consequences that follow.\n\nIt has become apparent that regulation is urgently needed. However, international law, has lagged significantly behind in its regulation of cyber operations, specifically on critical infrastructures. While the European Union is busy creating comprehensive regulations and directives which aim on the protection of critical infrastructures,⁶³ international law has been debating for the first ten years whether it applies to cyberspace,⁶⁴ and when this debate ended, how it can be applied, and if it is better to first apply non-binding norms.⁶⁵ This delay has created an even bigger gap and one may argue that has given states the signal that they will go unpunished if they organize or sponsor major cyber-attacks, hidden or not behind proxies.\n\nIn this paper I submit that international law already has the tools to contribute to an effective protection of critical infrastructures against cyber operations, namely the due diligence -and by extension the no-harm- obligation, and the rule prohibiting intervention in the internal affairs of another state. I believe that these rules, with certain modifications-necessary for them to properly function in the cyber environment-can be important legal protections against cyber-attacks, by threatening legal repercussions both to aggressor and to negligent states who allow their systems to be used for such malicious purposes.\n\nStarting with due diligence and no-harm, I will give a brief recount of their origin and position within international law and I will underline their flexibility as international legal rules. Furthermore, I will consider the difficulties that they may face when applied to cyberspace and finally analyze how certain elements of the rules may be modified in order to apply to cyberspace. Subsequently, I will turn to the non-intervention principle analyzing its origins and its elements. Moreover, I will reflect on how these elements function in the cyber domain and whether they should be tweaked towards an effective application of the rule.\n\n⁶¹ Fox-Sowell S, ‘New York lost $775M in cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in 2022, report says’ (Statescoop, 10 October 2023) <https: news-york-775-million-cyberattacks-critical-infrastructure=\"\" statescoop.com=\"\"></https:> accessed 31 October 2023.\n\n⁶² Maruf R, ‘The surprising reason you can’t find cream cheese anywhere’ (CNN Business, 18 December 2021) <https: 12=\"\" 18=\"\" 2021=\"\" edition.cnn.com=\"\" business=\"\" cream-cheese-cyberattack-schreiber-foods=\"\" index.html=\"\"> accessed 31 October 2023.\n\n⁶³ See for example Regulation (EU) 2019/881, OJ L 151, European Parliament and Council, 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) OJ L 151; Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union [2022] OJ L333/80, amending Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 and Directive (EU) 2018/1972, and repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (NIS 2 Directive) OJ L 333.\n\n⁶⁴ UNGA, ‘Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security’, UN Doc.

    "26\n\n# 1. The no-harm- due diligence duo: A rule(s) for all seasons?\n\nThe obligation to prevent transboundary harm (alternatively the no-harm principle) has been formulated in the Trail Smelter Arbitration⁶⁶ and was considered customary international law by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Corfu Channel case⁶⁷, a conclusion which has been reaffirmed in the Pulp Mills and the Certain Activities in the Border Area cases.⁶⁸ According to said principle, States have an obligation to prevent the use of their territory for activities causing injury or damage in the territory of another State as well as a duty to prevent transboundary harm from hazardous activities. It is considered a core part of international environmental law and of its many regimes (e.g. the law of international watercourses)⁶⁹ and has been developed extensively within this context.\n\nDue diligence is a very old concept in international law referred to in very old and very recent arbitral awards,⁷⁰ and in decisions of international tribunals, namely the ICJ⁷¹ and the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea (ITLOS)⁷² and has been accepted as a general principle of law.⁷³ There are many scholarly debates as to the nature and even the definition of due diligence as it has been called a \"duty\", \"obligation\", \"principle\" and \"rule\", thus creating wide doctrinal confusion.⁷⁴ Developing a commonly accepted definition of due diligence is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, for working reasons I will adopt that due diligence works through introducing positive obligations upon states to prevent unlawful situations and it can function both as a primary and a secondary international law rule.\n\nIn the context of this paper, I submit that the no-harm principle, and the due diligence obligations it creates, can be applied to cyberspace.

    "create obligations for states to take measures to prevent that their computer systems are not used to conduct a malicious cyber operation to another state. If a state would neglect taking such measures, this would incur its international responsibility. Accordingly, a portion of the cyber harm created by malicious cyber operations, could be redressed. Nevertheless, applying these rules to cyberspace is a challenging endeavor.\n\nFirstly, it must be examined whether the no-harm principle can be applied beyond the regime of international environmental law. The principle may have started in such a transboundary environmental context,75 nevertheless it has already been used in other contexts. Relevant discourse has argued that the no-harm principle can be the basis for effective climate change litigation and for enforcing obligations pertaining to climate change.76 Furthermore, the European Union has developed its own iteration of the principle, the 'do no significant harm' principle, which is used again in relation to harm to the environment but within the context of European investment law.77 Both of these uses indicate the malleability of the no-harm principle and how it easily interacts with different international (and not only) law regimes. Therefore, it can be considered that the no-harm principle is flexible enough as a principle in order to also apply to the cyber domain.\n\nRegarding due diligence, the 2014 and 2016 Reports of the International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law mention that due diligence obligations are understood and applied differently, depending on the sector involved.78 Nevertheless, several academics have argued that due diligence can be applied to cyberspace albeit proposing different avenues,79 and states have expressed different opinions for applying the due diligence principle to cyberspace.80 Until now there is no uniform opinion about the way that due diligence may apply to cyberspace. However, for the purposes of this paper, and since the no-harm rule is the main focus of this paper, it is submitted that obligations of a due diligence nature can be applied and function in cyberspace in the same way that they apply to the non-cyber domain.\n\n75 Trail Smelter (n 66); Corfu Channel Case (n 67).\n\n76 Nedeski N, Sparks T, and Hernandez GI, 'The World Is Burning, Urgently And Irreparably: A Plea for Interim Protection against Climatic Change at the ICJ' (2023) 22(2) The Law &amp; Practice of International Courts and Tribunals 301; Maljean-Dubois S, 'The No-Harm Principle and the Foundation of International Climate Change Law' in Benoit Mayer and Alexander Zahar (eds) Debating Climate Law (CUP, 2021), pp. 15–20.\n\n77 Karageorgou V, 'The Environmental Integration Principle in EU Law: Normative Content and Function also in Light of New Developments, such as the European Green Deal' (2023) 8(1) European Papers 159.\n\n78 ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', First Report, (2014); ILA, 'Study Group on Due Diligence in International Law', Second Report (2016).\n\n79 Schmitt M, 'In Defense of Due Diligence in Cyberspace' (2015-2016) 125 The Yale Law Journal Forum 68; Efrony D, Shany Y, 'A Rule Book on the Shelf?

    "Since cyberspace encompasses a series of unusual characteristics as a domain (e.g. a-territoriality, almost instant transmission of information) the no-harm principle cannot be applied as is. However, this does not mean that it is inapplicable. If certain elements of the principle are slightly modified, it is my contention that it can apply to cyberspace and be used to effectively redress cyber harm. In this paper, I will address two of those elements, the type of harm and the standard of knowledge required.\n\nThe first obstacle that must be surpassed, is the type of harm needed, in order for the no-harm principle to apply to cyberspace. It has been questioned, whether the no-harm principle can apply to types of harm that are beyond the environmental realm, to cover harms not related to the ecology.[81] Furthermore, it has also been questioned whether the no-harm principle can also cover non-physical harm.[82] Since the harm of cyber operations is mostly intangible and it is often not related to the environment, both of those questions are relevant for the application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace.\n\nFor the first part of the obstacle, there is enough evidence to support that the no-harm principle may cover harms beyond an ecological or environmental context. The International Law Commission (ILC), in its Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities defines harm as 'harm caused to persons, property and the environment'.[83] This position is also supported by judicial practice. When the Trail Smelter Arbitral Tribunal was looking at the history of the principle it found that the obligation not to cause transboundary harm includes any 'injurious acts to the territory of another state, persons or property therein.[84]\n\nThe second obstacle is slightly more difficult to overcome, especially considering that when the ILC started drafting the Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm, it consciously chose to focus only on physical harm.[85] However, this decision was a practical one, that recognized the absence of state practice on the matter, when the discussion for the articles was current (1983) and thus making ILC's work easier.[86] Nevertheless, there is evidence that states considered transboundary non-material injuries, even before 1983. Existing state practice, mainly in the field of radio-telecommunications, indicates that since 1927 states have agreed to refrain from and prevent harm that has no physical consequences.[87] Since states recognized duties to prevent such types of non-physical harm since 1927, and absent contrary state practice\n\n[81] Dias T, Coco A, Cyber Due Diligence in International Law (Oxford Institute for Ethics Law and Armed Conflict, 2021), p. 139.\n\n[82] Duvic-Paoli, L-A, The Prevention Principle in International Environmental Law (CUP, 2018), 181.\n\n[83] Article 2(b) ILC, 'Draft Articles on Prevention of Transboundary Harm from Hazardous Activities', ILC Yearbook 2001/II(2).\n\n[84] Trail Smelter (n 66) 1963.\n\n[85] ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83) 151.\n\n[86] Ibid.\n\n[87] ITU, 'Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (with annexes and optional protocol)', (adopted on 22 December 1992, entered into force 1 July 1994), 1825 UNTS 31251; ILC, 'Survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat', UN Doc A/CN.4/384, (1984), paras 58, 115.\n\n28",
    "and opinio juris, it can be argued that the no-harm principle can encompass cases of non-physical harm and thus apply to cyber operations.\n\nThe second obstacle that must be surpassed, in order for the no-harm principle to be applied to cyberspace, is connected to the standard of knowledge requirement. Normally, the no-harm principle is triggered by actual or constructive knowledge of even remote risk and excludes unforeseen harms.⁸⁸ However, the element of constructive knowledge has not been clarified when applied to cyberspace. Furthermore, this standard presupposes that states should proactively, constantly, and vigilantly monitor their networks in relation to the gravity of the harm.⁸⁹ Thus, an application of the no-harm principle to cyberspace would oblige states to monitor continuously and be vigilant in their use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs).\n\nThe claim that such an obligation to monitor networks exists now in international law is tenuous at best, as states' opinions on the issue, as well as the relevant scholarly discourse are divided. There are scholars who advocate that a duty of state to monitor its networks exist in different degrees. Indicatively, there are opinions that consider such a duty a prerequisite of constructive knowledge,⁹⁰ others that also support a duty to react,⁹¹ and even some that call for 'proactive measures of vigilance and monitoring.'⁹² On the other side of the fence, there are scholars that consider that such a duty to monitor could easily invite human rights violations from oppressive (and not only) regimes⁹³ while others outright reject the existence of such a duty.⁹⁴\n\nIn my opinion, a state's duty to monitor its networks can exist in the contest of applying the no-harm principle to cyberspace. The existence of such a duty would not cancel all the other obligations of the states, especially its human rights obligations which would continue to co-exist with a due diligence duty to monitor. The fear that states will overreach and violate international law, should not be a reason that we refuse to apply an international law rule. I would not go as far as to say that states should also have a duty to react, but international law is not foreign to duties to monitor as many regimes include such duties (e.g. the law of nuclear disarmament).⁹⁵\n\nTo conclude, I believe that the no-harm principle has the potential to act as a deterrent to major cyber-attacks, especially against critical infrastructures. From an international law standpoint, there is nothing that prevents its application to cyberspace. If states know that they will be responsible for being negligent regarding harmful\n\n⁸⁸ Couzigou, I, 'Securing Cyber Space: The Obligation of States to Prevent Harmful International Cyber Operations' (2018) 32 International Review of Law, Computers &amp; Technology 37.\n\n⁸⁹ ILC, Draft Articles on Prevention (n 83).\n\n⁹⁰ Buchan, R, 'Cyberspace, Non-State Actors and the Obligation to Prevent Transboundary Harm' (2016) 21(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law 429.\n\n⁹¹ Bannelier-Christakis K, 'Cyber Diligence: A Low-Intensity Due Diligence Principle for Low-Intensity Cyber Operations?'

    "cyber operations, they will have a motive to increase their cybersecurity standards, introduce new cybersecurity protections, and generally be more vigilant against cyberattacks. And lastly, taking into account that the most vulnerable targets tend to be their critical infrastructures, states will rush to fortify them fostering thus a new culture for cybersecurity.\n\n## 2. The non-intervention principle: A classic rule for a modern solution\n\nThe non-intervention principle is one of the fundamental principles of international law.96 Based on sovereign equality and political independence,97 it forbids states from intervening coercively in the domestic or foreign affairs of other states.98 Its importance in international law has been recognized both by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ)99 and by the ICJ.100 According to the latter, non-intervention represents 'the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs without outside interference and is one bearing on matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.101\n\nHowever, cyberspace alters the playing field significantly. Newfound threats like digital election interference102 and the increase of state sponsored cyber-attacks aiming to intervene to other states' internal affairs103 disrupt significantly the two constitutive elements of intervention, namely the element of coercion and the element of domaine réservé, when applied two cyberspace, as they are applied in a kinetic context. Thus, like the case of the no-harm principle, it must be examined whether those two elements need to be modified in order to apply in a cyber context.\n\nThe first element that I will consider is the element of coercion. There is an abundance of sources which establish the stalwart link between non-intervention and coercion, which includes judicial practice,104 state practice,105 and even scholarly views about its existence in a cyber context.106 It is thus accepted that for an intervention to be prohibited, coercion is essential. The threshold of coercion, however, can still be\n\n96 ICJ, Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

    "considered elusive as there are different opinions about it.¹⁰⁷ The opinions converge however that coercion removes from a state its control over its sovereign will. In the cyber age, these ideas of coercion create some difficult challenges. For example, what is the required magnitude of coercion? Is absolute loss of control required, or can it be partial? What if an initial act of influence or interference sets in motion a series of circumstances that deprives the victim State of authority over a particular matter?\n\nThe cyber environment makes it increasingly difficult for coercion to be proven. Cyber interventions are usually more nuanced and, in the end, fail to reach the threshold of the 'traditional' iteration of coercion. This leads to often catastrophic cyber-attacks (e.g. the SolarWinds Hack) not being classified as unlawful intervention since that threshold is not met.\n\nConsidering this, there is already support by scholars that advocate for lowering said threshold¹⁰⁸ or reformulating it¹⁰⁹ in order to apply to cyberspace. An idea that exists is to interpret coercion based on the unique challenges that cyberspace presents, adopting a broad interpretation of coercion.¹¹⁰ Another proposal includes looking at non-intervention through a human rights perspective and thus linking coercion with violations of different human rights elements (e.g., the right to self-determination).¹¹¹ An older approach, instructs looking not at the tools and methods when discussing coercion, but rather at the effects that this coercion has on the victim state.¹¹² This can prove significantly effective for cyber operations since the methods that ore often used cannot reach the traditional threshold for coercion per se, but their effects could. Similar to this contention, another idea proposed that instead of coercion, the focus should be whether an activity causes a disruption, in order to amount to an unlawful intervention.¹¹³ This also seems to be a good fit for cyber intervention, especially considering cases of disinformation, news manipulation and propaganda campaigns.\n\nConcerning coercion, it is my submission that it can be broadened as a concept in order to apply to cyberspace. Specifically, I believe that the traditional threshold of coercion is set too high, rendering the rule prohibiting intervention useless in a cyber context. For non-intervention to be applicable in cyberspace, an effects approach, would\n\n¹⁰⁷ Jamnejad M and Wood M, 'The Principle of Non-Intervention' (2009) 22 Leiden Journal of International Law 345; Kilovaty I, 'The Elephant in the Room: Coercion' (2019) 113 American Journal of International Law Unbound 87, p. 89; Schmitt M, \"'Virtual' Disenfranchisement: Cyber Election Meddling in the Grey Zones of International Law' (2018) 19 Chicago Journal of International Law 30, p. 51.\n\n¹⁰⁸ Schmitt M and Vihul L, 'Sovereignty in Cyberspace: Lex Lata Vel Non?'

    "be better suited, especially taking into account the plurality and the variety of cyber threats. In any event, following effects-based approaches to apply international law rules to cyberspace, has already proven useful, since such an effects-based approach is one of the most dominant when applying the prohibition to use force in cyberspace.¹¹⁴\n\nThe second element to be considered is the one of domaine réservé. In Nicaragua, the ICJ defined the domaine réservé, as 'matters in which each State is permitted, by the principle of State sovereignty, to decide freely'.¹¹⁵ The Court also provided two very broad examples 'the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy'.¹¹⁶ Michael Schmitt made an effort to distinguish between issues that fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and those that do not. Schmitt says that while 'commercial activities typically do not,' 'elections fall within the domaine réservé.' At first glance, if a State participated in a meddling act 'meant to give business advantages to its national companies' it wouldn't violate the non-intervention tenet.¹¹⁷ Nevertheless, Schmitt also acknowledges that there may be a grey zone in the context of online communications.¹¹⁸\n\nFurthermore, as was the case with coercion, cyberspace blurs the line regarding what can be considered as domaine réservé of a state. For example, would the dissemination of disinformation on a private social media site be considered an interference with the electoral system? Is targeting consumers with false news about their elected authorities considered political interference? Given that private internet players such as Facebook and Twitter serve no sovereign purpose, it appears contradictory to regard any behavior occurring on these platforms as domaine réservé.¹¹⁹ In addition, the growing presence of non-state actors, which may have tenuous connection with states—not enough for attribution to be established—complicates things and questions the character of non-intervention as solely an inter-state rule.\n\nThus, the element of domaine réservé must also be tweaked in order to properly apply to cyberspace. There have already been some proposals on the matter. To illustrate, it has been suggested that domaine réservé must be reinterpreted as domaine privilégié. This notion, based on the protective (or territoriality) principle,¹²⁰ would include the traditional elements of domaine réservé along with a state's vital interests (e.g. national security and public safety) which are 'necessary for the very survival of a state but also those that are essential for its independence, autonomy and stability'.¹²¹ Others have supported that if the actualised harm of an attack forces a state to make a policy change\n\n¹¹⁴ Buchan R, 'Cyber Attacks: Unlawful Uses of Force or Prohibited Interventions?' (2012) 17 Journal of Conflict and Security Law 211, p. 212; Dinniss H H, Cyber Warfare and the Laws of War (CUP, 2012), p. 74.\n\n¹¹⁵ Nicaragua Case (n 96), para 205.\n\n¹¹⁶ Ibid.\n\n¹¹⁷ Schmitt M, 'Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace' (2017) 42 Yale Journal of International Law 1.\n\n¹¹⁸ Ibid.\n\n¹¹⁹ Kilovaty, 'The international law of cyber intervention' (n 107), p. 103.\n\n¹²⁰ Higgins R, Themes and Theories, (OUP, 2009), pp. 799–810.\n\n¹²¹ Moulin T, 'Reviving the Principle of Non-Intervention in Cyberspace: The Path Forward' (2020) 25(3) Journal of Conflict &amp; Security Law, p. 437.\n\n32",
    "that it would not have made without the existence of said attack, even if the harm was not done in a sector covered by the domaine réservé, this attack is considered prohibited intervention.¹²²\n\nAs with coercion, the latter of the aforementioned contentions, which is based on an effects approach, seems to be the best fit for cyberspace particularities. This would allow the rule to be applied despite the quiet restrictive traditional iteration of domaine réservé and also take into account the blurring of the lines between state and private that cyberspace inevitably imposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReflecting on the analyzed elements of traditional international law rules, we can draw some conclusions on how said rules may be applied to cyberspace. First and foremost, I believe that the aforementioned analysis is proof that international law may be tweaked in order to address situations in the field of cyberspace, even though the specific international law rule was not created to apply to that specific situation. International law has shown throughout the years that it can be flexible and its rules be modified according to the particular context they are applied. Any calls to the opposite, only contribute to the rigidity and sluggishness for which international law is infamous for.\n\nSecondly, due to its peculiarities, cyberspace seems to favour a version of the rules that focuses on an effects-based approach. Due to the rapid speed with which cyber-attacks are conducted, the possibility to use multiple proxies, as well as the ease with which the instruments of the attacks are obfuscated, it is better to focus on the damage that the cyber-attack has caused that the action itself. This is not the perfect way, but it is the pragmatic way to effectively regulate, even in part, cyberspace. This concerns both the application of the no-harm principle and the principle of non-intervention when applied to cyberspace.\n\nThe protection of critical infrastructures against malicious cyber operations is an issue of vital importance and it has not been given the attention it deserves. International law can play a considerable part and it only needs to utilise some of its most traditional and basic rules. The due diligence obligations of the no-harm principle, and the prohibition of intervention are cornerstones of the international legal order. Nevertheless, this exercise can also function as a way to underline the need for flexibility when applying international law and the importance of attempting to apply the existing rules before starting to create new ones.\n\n¹²² Coco A, Dias T and van Benthem T, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’ (2022) 33(4) European Journal of International Law 1275, p. 1281."
