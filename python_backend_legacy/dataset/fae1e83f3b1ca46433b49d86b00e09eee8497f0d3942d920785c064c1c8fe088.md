What are the tools and techniques that could help to identify the hackers who have conducted a cyber-operation? And why is credible attribution in the case of cyberattacks carried out or masterminded by Russia so challenging? These are the questions which this chapter aims to address in detail. However, before examining the technical, intelligence and geopolitical aspects of attribution, this chapter will first explain what attribution is and why it is important in the domain of cybersecurity\n## Attribution: what it is and what for?\nThe term ‘attribution’ chiefly refers to a concept in international law that describes the process of identifying an attack or operation against a state. It is widely used in debates about the norms and rules of state behaviour and how they apply to cyberspace. Strictly speaking, attribution is usually used in the context of armed attacks and considered as one of the main legal requirements for the right of states to resort to force in self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter. Any state action that refers to this article has to be justified by the credible identification of the origins of an attack. Only by supplying such evidence, are states deemed to have the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’ and can therefore take steps towards an appropriate response to stop these threats. Attribution is also used to convince the state’s own government, public, and transnational partner organisations about the origin of a cyberattack. The threshold to convince these parties might be lower than the one required to trigger article 51.\nIn the case of national attribution policymakers and the executive have to be convinced about the origin of an attack in order to legitimise the use of offensive countermeasures. This form of assessment can rely on all technical, geopolitical and\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nintelligence data that is available. Transnational attribution refers to convincing allies, bilaterally or as a whole (e.g. through NATO), about the validity of the attribution. This is essential in order to obtain political, diplomatic or other kinds of support from allies. It might not be possible to explicitly use or cite certain intelligence and technical data to convince them, as such data may be too highly classified. Naturally, this might limit the credibility of the attribution analysis. Then there is public attribution which refers to convincing the public with the attribution assessment. Having public backing in a democratic country allows the government to choose from a wider range of policy options. Credible public attribution enables the government to take certain steps, such as expelling diplomats or implementing economic sanctions, or at least facilitates such a response. Unlike in the case of transnational attribution (for which purpose allies might partially share sensitive information), most intelligence information and certain technical data cannot be shared with the public due to its classified and highly confidential nature. And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.\n# Attributing a cyber operation\n## Technical aspects of attribution\nFrom a technical point of view, measures for attribution need to be articulated in at least two dimensions. The first dimension distinguishes between those measures that can be established in the domestic IT systems and networks of a state ('inner scope measures') and those that need to exist or be built up in foreign IT systems ('outer scope measures'). The second dimension is composed of preventive and reactive measures. Preventive measures constantly observe, collect and store data that could be used to identify an attack that is detected or noticed at a later point in time. Reactive measures can be used to 'mark and track down an attacker' during an ongoing operation.\nInner and outer scope measures are both crucial to establishing credible attribution. Therefore, each state would need to have implemented its own set of data-gathering measures and/or allow defenders to trail attackers through their systems. This is clearly a challenge in the realm of international relations. Defining international standards for data-gathering measures, cooperation guidelines, information sharing and known communication channels would go a long way towards addressing this challenge and creating a common process to enable an international response. A first step towards such international cooperation has been made by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹ which became effective in 2004. Its agreements however do not apply to norms of state behaviour like espionage or military cyber activities and its practical aspects still need additional and more simplified cooperation\n¹ Council of Europe, Details of Treaty no.185, Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, November 23, 2001, https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nSpotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\nmeasures. The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017.² Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’,³ is currently the most recent development in this area.\n## Monitoring and logging\nA first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period⁴ play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network.⁵ The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred.⁶ Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n## Computer forensics\nWhen an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents. This\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nranges from the language, geolocation or working hours uncovered by this form of assessment to code fragments and linked IT-infrastructures, such as email addresses and device IPs. This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n## Passive tracking\nPassive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n## Active tracking\nStrong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and\n7. After incidents, detailed information about the tools of the 'defending' side are rarely revealed. Therefore it is difficult to point out a real-world example of honeypot usage. Press reports covering the recent attack against the Federal Foreign Office in Germany however stated that the investigating agencies are aware of the incident and are monitoring the attackers' activities which may be an indication that tools like honeypots or beacons had been used. For more details see \"Cyber-Espionage Hits Berlin - The Breach from the East,\" Der Spiegel, March 2018, http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cyber-espionage-likely-from-russia-targets-german-government-a-1196320.html.\n8. Honeypots can also be installed as a preventive measure but are most effective when tailor-made to a specific attack and its anticipated goals.\n9.

A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem.¹² While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution\nObtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots.¹³ Additionally, the public learned\n¹⁰ A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n¹¹ It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n¹² An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n¹³ United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nthat America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools.¹⁴ In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment,¹⁵ it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015.¹⁶ Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee¹⁷ because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report¹⁸ that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true.¹⁹ At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n14.

While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of\n20. An attack which while disguising the real perpetrator creates the impression that a third party is behind it.\n21. A third aspect could be 'for lulz' (for fun). While this kind of motivation has been in sharp decline in the past few years, groups such as Anonymous and LulzSsec have conducted a number of high-profile hacking operations with the apparent goal of ridiculing the victim.\n22.

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries.²⁵ False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia\nRussia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies.²⁶ Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable²⁷ in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’²⁸ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it.²⁹ Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task³⁰ which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation.³¹ Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness\n25.

A device which is only used for a particular attack and then trashed to hinder attribution. Derived from the concept of a ‘burner phone’.\n29. An attack might have several ‘origins’, which are intermediate systems exploited by the attacker to make an uninvolved third party look like the adversary. The ‘real origin’ of an attack is the point where the attack was started by the aggressor.\n30. Two case studies that show the complexity of this task, the different sources that have to be taken into account, the technical difficulties and challenges of tying this information together are the final report of Ralph Langner on Stuxnet, “To Kill a Centrifuge: A Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet’s Creators Tried to Achieve”, The Langner Group, November 2013, https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, as well as the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n31. A good example of the complexity of this task is given in Ralph Langner’s analysis of the Stuxnet incident.

Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations³². There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.³³\nAdditionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory,³⁴ pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace,³⁵ it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report³⁶ and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings.³⁷ In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition\n32. For instance the hacking attacks against German governmental and parliamentary IT systems from 2015 and 2018 yielded no official reaction against the suggested attackers, whereas a hacking attack against the US-based company Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2014 almost immediately (in terms of days) resulted in US sanctions against North Korea.\n33.

Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community.\nThis pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain.

And why is credible attribution in the case of cyberattacks carried out or masterminded by Russia so challenging? These are the questions which this chapter aims to address in detail. However, before examining the technical, intelligence and geopolitical aspects of attribution, this chapter will first explain what attribution is and why it is important in the domain of cybersecurity\n## Attribution: what it is and what for?\nThe term ‘attribution’ chiefly refers to a concept in international law that describes the process of identifying an attack or operation against a state. It is widely used in debates about the norms and rules of state behaviour and how they apply to cyberspace. Strictly speaking, attribution is usually used in the context of armed attacks and considered as one of the main legal requirements for the right of states to resort to force in self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter. Any state action that refers to this article has to be justified by the credible identification of the origins of an attack. Only by supplying such evidence, are states deemed to have the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’ and can therefore take steps towards an appropriate response to stop these threats. Attribution is also used to convince the state’s own government, public, and transnational partner organisations about the origin of a cyberattack. The threshold to convince these parties might be lower than the one required to trigger article 51.\nIn the case of national attribution policymakers and the executive have to be convinced about the origin of an attack in order to legitimise the use of offensive countermeasures. This form of assessment can rely on all technical, geopolitical and\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nintelligence data that is available. Transnational attribution refers to convincing allies, bilaterally or as a whole (e.g. through NATO), about the validity of the attribution. This is essential in order to obtain political, diplomatic or other kinds of support from allies. It might not be possible to explicitly use or cite certain intelligence and technical data to convince them, as such data may be too highly classified. Naturally, this might limit the credibility of the attribution analysis. Then there is public attribution which refers to convincing the public with the attribution assessment. Having public backing in a democratic country allows the government to choose from a wider range of policy options. Credible public attribution enables the government to take certain steps, such as expelling diplomats or implementing economic sanctions, or at least facilitates such a response. Unlike in the case of transnational attribution (for which purpose allies might partially share sensitive information), most intelligence information and certain technical data cannot be shared with the public due to its classified and highly confidential nature. And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.\n# Attributing a cyber operation\n## Technical aspects of attribution\nFrom a technical point of view, measures for attribution need to be articulated in at least two dimensions. The first dimension distinguishes between those measures that can be established in the domestic IT systems and networks of a state ('inner scope measures') and those that need to exist or be built up in foreign IT systems ('outer scope measures'). The second dimension is composed of preventive and reactive measures. Preventive measures constantly observe, collect and store data that could be used to identify an attack that is detected or noticed at a later point in time. Reactive measures can be used to 'mark and track down an attacker' during an ongoing operation.\nInner and outer scope measures are both crucial to establishing credible attribution. Therefore, each state would need to have implemented its own set of data-gathering measures and/or allow defenders to trail attackers through their systems. This is clearly a challenge in the realm of international relations. Defining international standards for data-gathering measures, cooperation guidelines, information sharing and known communication channels would go a long way towards addressing this challenge and creating a common process to enable an international response. A first step towards such international cooperation has been made by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime which became effective in 2004. Its agreements however do not apply to norms of state behaviour like espionage or military cyber activities and its practical aspects still need additional and more simplified cooperation\n Council of Europe, Details of Treaty no.185, Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, November 23, 2001, https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nSpotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\nmeasures. The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017. Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’, is currently the most recent development in this area.\n## Monitoring and logging\nA first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network. The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred. Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n## Computer forensics\nWhen an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents. This\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nranges from the language, geolocation or working hours uncovered by this form of assessment to code fragments and linked IT-infrastructures, such as email addresses and device IPs. This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n## Passive tracking\nPassive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n## Active tracking\nStrong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and\n7. After incidents, detailed information about the tools of the 'defending' side are rarely revealed. Therefore it is difficult to point out a real-world example of honeypot usage. Press reports covering the recent attack against the Federal Foreign Office in Germany however stated that the investigating agencies are aware of the incident and are monitoring the attackers' activities which may be an indication that tools like honeypots or beacons had been used. For more details see \"Cyber-Espionage Hits Berlin - The Breach from the East,\" Der Spiegel, March 2018, http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cyber-espionage-likely-from-russia-targets-german-government-a-1196320.html.\n8. Honeypots can also be installed as a preventive measure but are most effective when tailor-made to a specific attack and its anticipated goals.\n9.

Another approach that enables monitoring an attack but avoids the risks of hack-back is to deliberately become one of the exploited systems that the attacker is using – similar to the honeypot approach.\n## Assembling the puzzle\nAll these approaches can help a defender to collect data and information about the tactics, the tools and the different steps of an attack in order to compare them to known capacities of threat actors and the sophistication and methods attested in former incidents. It is important to bear in mind that while each of these individual pieces of information can be a lead to the attacker, they can also be manipulated or crafted to leave misleading tracks which could potentially incriminate a third party. A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem. While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution\nObtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots. Additionally, the public learned\n A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nthat America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools. In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015. Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true. At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n14.

While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of\n20. An attack which while disguising the real perpetrator creates the impression that a third party is behind it.\n21. A third aspect could be 'for lulz' (for fun). While this kind of motivation has been in sharp decline in the past few years, groups such as Anonymous and LulzSsec have conducted a number of high-profile hacking operations with the apparent goal of ridiculing the victim.\n22.

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries. False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia\nRussia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies. Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it. Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation. Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness\n25.

A device which is only used for a particular attack and then trashed to hinder attribution. Derived from the concept of a ‘burner phone’.\n29. An attack might have several ‘origins’, which are intermediate systems exploited by the attacker to make an uninvolved third party look like the adversary. The ‘real origin’ of an attack is the point where the attack was started by the aggressor.\n30. Two case studies that show the complexity of this task, the different sources that have to be taken into account, the technical difficulties and challenges of tying this information together are the final report of Ralph Langner on Stuxnet, “To Kill a Centrifuge: A Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet’s Creators Tried to Achieve”, The Langner Group, November 2013, https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, as well as the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n31.

Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations. There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.\nAdditionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory, pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace, it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings. In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition\n32. For instance the hacking attacks against German governmental and parliamentary IT systems from 2015 and 2018 yielded no official reaction against the suggested attackers, whereas a hacking attack against the US-based company Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2014 almost immediately (in terms of days) resulted in US sanctions against North Korea.\n33.

Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community.\nThis pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain.

What are the tools and techniques that could help to identify the hackers who have conducted a cyber-operation? And why is credible attribution in the case of cyberattacks carried out or masterminded by Russia so challenging? These are the questions which this chapter aims to address in detail. However, before examining the technical, intelligence and geopolitical aspects of attribution, this chapter will first explain what attribution is and why it is important in the domain of cybersecurity ## Attribution: what it is and what for?\nThe term ‘attribution’ chiefly refers to a concept in international law that describes the process of identifying an attack or operation against a state. It is widely used in debates about the norms and rules of state behaviour and how they apply to cyberspace. Strictly speaking, attribution is usually used in the context of armed attacks and considered as one of the main legal requirements for the right of states to resort to force in self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter. Any state action that refers to this article has to be justified by the credible identification of the origins of an attack. Only by supplying such evidence, are states deemed to have the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’ and can therefore take steps towards an appropriate response to stop these threats. Attribution is also used to convince the state’s own government, public, and transnational partner organisations about the origin of a cyberattack. The threshold to convince these parties might be lower than the one required to trigger article 51.\nIn the case of national attribution policymakers and the executive have to be convinced about the origin of an attack in order to legitimise the use of offensive countermeasures.

Transnational attribution refers to convincing allies, bilaterally or as a whole (e.g. through NATO), about the validity of the attribution. This is essential in order to obtain political, diplomatic or other kinds of support from allies. It might not be possible to explicitly use or cite certain intelligence and technical data to convince them, as such data may be too highly classified. Naturally, this might limit the credibility of the attribution analysis. Then there is public attribution which refers to convincing the public with the attribution assessment. Having public backing in a democratic country allows the government to choose from a wider range of policy options. Credible public attribution enables the government to take certain steps, such as expelling diplomats or implementing economic sanctions, or at least facilitates such a response. Unlike in the case of transnational attribution (for which purpose allies might partially share sensitive information), most intelligence information and certain technical data cannot be shared with the public due to its classified and highly confidential nature. And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.",
    "## Monitoring and logging A first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period⁴ play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network.⁵ The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred.⁶ Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.": "",
    "## Computer forensics When an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents.

For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n¹² An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n¹³ United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms HACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES that America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools.¹⁴ In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment,¹⁵ it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015.¹⁶ Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee¹⁷ because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report¹⁸ that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true.¹⁹ At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace # Geopolitics of attribution Geopolitics might only play a minor role in the attribution of cyber operations but this dimension should not be disregarded. While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms HACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES the world (instead of towards Russia). If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries.²⁵ False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia Russia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies.²⁶ Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable²⁷ in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’²⁸ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it.²⁹ Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task³⁰ which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation.³¹ Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace of the information about a cyberattack raises the risks of misunderstandings, miscalculations, misinterpretations and wrong responses, especially when other means of crisis communication or confidence-building measures between the adversaries are missing. Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations³². There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.³³ Additionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory,³⁴ pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace,³⁵ it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report³⁶ and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings.³⁷ In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms HACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community.\nThis pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain. This would provide a strong basis for enforceable regimes of international law in cyberspace.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.\n# Attributing a cyber operation\n## Technical aspects of attribution\nFrom a technical point of view, measures for attribution need to be articulated in at least two dimensions. The first dimension distinguishes between those measures that can be established in the domestic IT systems and networks of a state ('inner scope measures') and those that need to exist or be built up in foreign IT systems ('outer scope measures'). The second dimension is composed of preventive and reactive measures. Preventive measures constantly observe, collect and store data that could be used to identify an attack that is detected or noticed at a later point in time. Reactive measures can be used to 'mark and track down an attacker' during an ongoing operation.\nInner and outer scope measures are both crucial to establishing credible attribution. Therefore, each state would need to have implemented its own set of data-gathering measures and/or allow defenders to trail attackers through their systems. This is clearly a challenge in the realm of international relations. Defining international standards for data-gathering measures, cooperation guidelines, information sharing and known communication channels would go a long way towards addressing this challenge and creating a common process to enable an international response. A first step towards such international cooperation has been made by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime which became effective in 2004. Its agreements however do not apply to norms of state behaviour like espionage or military cyber activities and its practical aspects still need additional and more simplified cooperation\n Council of Europe, Details of Treaty no.185, Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, November 23, 2001, https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nSpotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\nmeasures. The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017. Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’, is currently the most recent development in this area.\n## Monitoring and logging\nA first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network. The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred. Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n## Computer forensics\nWhen an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents.

This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n## Passive tracking\nPassive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n## Active tracking\nStrong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and\n7. After incidents, detailed information about the tools of the 'defending' side are rarely revealed. Therefore it is difficult to point out a real-world example of honeypot usage. Press reports covering the recent attack against the Federal Foreign Office in Germany however stated that the investigating agencies are aware of the incident and are monitoring the attackers' activities which may be an indication that tools like honeypots or beacons had been used. For more details see \"Cyber-Espionage Hits Berlin - The Breach from the East,\" Der Spiegel, March 2018, http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cyber-espionage-likely-from-russia-targets-german-government-a-1196320.html.\n8. Honeypots can also be installed as a preventive measure but are most effective when tailor-made to a specific attack and its anticipated goals.\n9.

Another approach that enables monitoring an attack but avoids the risks of hack-back is to deliberately become one of the exploited systems that the attacker is using – similar to the honeypot approach.\n## Assembling the puzzle\nAll these approaches can help a defender to collect data and information about the tactics, the tools and the different steps of an attack in order to compare them to known capacities of threat actors and the sophistication and methods attested in former incidents. It is important to bear in mind that while each of these individual pieces of information can be a lead to the attacker, they can also be manipulated or crafted to leave misleading tracks which could potentially incriminate a third party. A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem. While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution\nObtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots. Additionally, the public learned\n A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nthat America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools. In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015. Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true. At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n14.

While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of\n20. An attack which while disguising the real perpetrator creates the impression that a third party is behind it.\n21. A third aspect could be 'for lulz' (for fun). While this kind of motivation has been in sharp decline in the past few years, groups such as Anonymous and LulzSsec have conducted a number of high-profile hacking operations with the apparent goal of ridiculing the victim.\n22.

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries. False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia\nRussia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies. Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it. Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation. Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness\n25.

A device which is only used for a particular attack and then trashed to hinder attribution. Derived from the concept of a ‘burner phone’.\n29. An attack might have several ‘origins’, which are intermediate systems exploited by the attacker to make an uninvolved third party look like the adversary. The ‘real origin’ of an attack is the point where the attack was started by the aggressor.\n30. Two case studies that show the complexity of this task, the different sources that have to be taken into account, the technical difficulties and challenges of tying this information together are the final report of Ralph Langner on Stuxnet, “To Kill a Centrifuge: A Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet’s Creators Tried to Achieve”, The Langner Group, November 2013, https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, as well as the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n31.

Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations. There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.\nAdditionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory, pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace, it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings. In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition\n32. For instance the hacking attacks against German governmental and parliamentary IT systems from 2015 and 2018 yielded no official reaction against the suggested attackers, whereas a hacking attack against the US-based company Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2014 almost immediately (in terms of days) resulted in US sanctions against North Korea.\n33.

Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community.\nThis pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain.

Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.",

While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks. The second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of",

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries.²⁵ False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon. # Why it is problematic to point to Russia Russia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies.²⁶ Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience. Whereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable²⁷ in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’²⁸ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it.²⁹ Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task³⁰ which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation.³¹ Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness",

Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations³². There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.³³ Additionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory,³⁴ pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace,³⁵ it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities. From the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report³⁶ and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings.³⁷ In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28.

Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community. This pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain.

What are the tools and techniques that could help to identify the hackers who have conducted a cyber-operation? And why is credible attribution in the case of cyberattacks carried out or masterminded by Russia so challenging? These are the questions which this chapter aims to address in detail. However, before examining the technical, intelligence and geopolitical aspects of attribution, this chapter will first explain what attribution is and why it is important in the domain of cybersecurity\n## Attribution: what it is and what for?\nThe term ‘attribution’ chiefly refers to a concept in international law that describes the process of identifying an attack or operation against a state. It is widely used in debates about the norms and rules of state behaviour and how they apply to cyberspace. Strictly speaking, attribution is usually used in the context of armed attacks and considered as one of the main legal requirements for the right of states to resort to force in self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter. Any state action that refers to this article has to be justified by the credible identification of the origins of an attack. Only by supplying such evidence, are states deemed to have the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’ and can therefore take steps towards an appropriate response to stop these threats. Attribution is also used to convince the state’s own government, public, and transnational partner organisations about the origin of a cyberattack. The threshold to convince these parties might be lower than the one required to trigger article 51.\nIn the case of national attribution policymakers and the executive have to be convinced about the origin of an attack in order to legitimise the use of offensive countermeasures. This form of assessment can rely on all technical, geopolitical and\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nintelligence data that is available. Transnational attribution refers to convincing allies, bilaterally or as a whole (e.g. through NATO), about the validity of the attribution. This is essential in order to obtain political, diplomatic or other kinds of support from allies. It might not be possible to explicitly use or cite certain intelligence and technical data to convince them, as such data may be too highly classified. Naturally, this might limit the credibility of the attribution analysis. Then there is public attribution which refers to convincing the public with the attribution assessment. Having public backing in a democratic country allows the government to choose from a wider range of policy options. Credible public attribution enables the government to take certain steps, such as expelling diplomats or implementing economic sanctions, or at least facilitates such a response. Unlike in the case of transnational attribution (for which purpose allies might partially share sensitive information), most intelligence information and certain technical data cannot be shared with the public due to its classified and highly confidential nature. And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.\n# Attributing a cyber operation\n## Technical aspects of attribution\nFrom a technical point of view, measures for attribution need to be articulated in at least two dimensions. The first dimension distinguishes between those measures that can be established in the domestic IT systems and networks of a state ('inner scope measures') and those that need to exist or be built up in foreign IT systems ('outer scope measures'). The second dimension is composed of preventive and reactive measures. Preventive measures constantly observe, collect and store data that could be used to identify an attack that is detected or noticed at a later point in time. Reactive measures can be used to 'mark and track down an attacker' during an ongoing operation.\nInner and outer scope measures are both crucial to establishing credible attribution. Therefore, each state would need to have implemented its own set of data-gathering measures and/or allow defenders to trail attackers through their systems. This is clearly a challenge in the realm of international relations. Defining international standards for data-gathering measures, cooperation guidelines, information sharing and known communication channels would go a long way towards addressing this challenge and creating a common process to enable an international response. A first step towards such international cooperation has been made by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime which became effective in 2004. Its agreements however do not apply to norms of state behaviour like espionage or military cyber activities and its practical aspects still need additional and more simplified cooperation\n Council of Europe, Details of Treaty no.185, Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, November 23, 2001, https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nSpotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\nmeasures. The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017. Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’, is currently the most recent development in this area.\n## Monitoring and logging\nA first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network. The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred. Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n## Computer forensics\nWhen an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents. This\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nranges from the language, geolocation or working hours uncovered by this form of assessment to code fragments and linked IT-infrastructures, such as email addresses and device IPs. This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n## Passive tracking\nPassive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n## Active tracking\nStrong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and\n7. After incidents, detailed information about the tools of the 'defending' side are rarely revealed. Therefore it is difficult to point out a real-world example of honeypot usage. Press reports covering the recent attack against the Federal Foreign Office in Germany however stated that the investigating agencies are aware of the incident and are monitoring the attackers' activities which may be an indication that tools like honeypots or beacons had been used. For more details see \"Cyber-Espionage Hits Berlin - The Breach from the East,\" Der Spiegel, March 2018, http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cyber-espionage-likely-from-russia-targets-german-government-a-1196320.html.\n8. Honeypots can also be installed as a preventive measure but are most effective when tailor-made to a specific attack and its anticipated goals.\n9.

Another approach that enables monitoring an attack but avoids the risks of hack-back is to deliberately become one of the exploited systems that the attacker is using – similar to the honeypot approach.\n## Assembling the puzzle\nAll these approaches can help a defender to collect data and information about the tactics, the tools and the different steps of an attack in order to compare them to known capacities of threat actors and the sophistication and methods attested in former incidents. It is important to bear in mind that while each of these individual pieces of information can be a lead to the attacker, they can also be manipulated or crafted to leave misleading tracks which could potentially incriminate a third party. A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem. While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution\nObtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots. Additionally, the public learned\n A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nthat America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools. In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015. Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true. At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n14.

While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of\n20. An attack which while disguising the real perpetrator creates the impression that a third party is behind it.\n21. A third aspect could be 'for lulz' (for fun). While this kind of motivation has been in sharp decline in the past few years, groups such as Anonymous and LulzSsec have conducted a number of high-profile hacking operations with the apparent goal of ridiculing the victim.\n22.

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries. False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia\nRussia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies. Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it. Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation. Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness\n25.

A device which is only used for a particular attack and then trashed to hinder attribution. Derived from the concept of a ‘burner phone’.\n29. An attack might have several ‘origins’, which are intermediate systems exploited by the attacker to make an uninvolved third party look like the adversary. The ‘real origin’ of an attack is the point where the attack was started by the aggressor.\n30. Two case studies that show the complexity of this task, the different sources that have to be taken into account, the technical difficulties and challenges of tying this information together are the final report of Ralph Langner on Stuxnet, “To Kill a Centrifuge: A Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet’s Creators Tried to Achieve”, The Langner Group, November 2013, https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, as well as the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n31.

Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations. There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.\nAdditionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory, pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace, it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings. In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition\n32. For instance the hacking attacks against German governmental and parliamentary IT systems from 2015 and 2018 yielded no official reaction against the suggested attackers, whereas a hacking attack against the US-based company Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2014 almost immediately (in terms of days) resulted in US sanctions against North Korea.\n33.

Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community.\nThis pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain. This would provide a strong basis for enforceable regimes of international law in cyberspace.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

What are the tools and techniques that could help to identify the hackers who have conducted a cyber-operation? And why is credible attribution in the case of cyberattacks carried out or masterminded by Russia so challenging? These are the questions which this chapter aims to address in detail. However, before examining the technical, intelligence and geopolitical aspects of attribution, this chapter will first explain what attribution is and why it is important in the domain of cybersecurity\n## Attribution: what it is and what for?\nThe term ‘attribution’ chiefly refers to a concept in international law that describes the process of identifying an attack or operation against a state. It is widely used in debates about the norms and rules of state behaviour and how they apply to cyberspace. Strictly speaking, attribution is usually used in the context of armed attacks and considered as one of the main legal requirements for the right of states to resort to force in self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter. Any state action that refers to this article has to be justified by the credible identification of the origins of an attack. Only by supplying such evidence, are states deemed to have the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’ and can therefore take steps towards an appropriate response to stop these threats. Attribution is also used to convince the state’s own government, public, and transnational partner organisations about the origin of a cyberattack. The threshold to convince these parties might be lower than the one required to trigger article 51.\nIn the case of national attribution policymakers and the executive have to be convinced about the origin of an attack in order to legitimise the use of offensive countermeasures.

Transnational attribution refers to convincing allies, bilaterally or as a whole (e.g. through NATO), about the validity of the attribution. This is essential in order to obtain political, diplomatic or other kinds of support from allies. It might not be possible to explicitly use or cite certain intelligence and technical data to convince them, as such data may be too highly classified. Naturally, this might limit the credibility of the attribution analysis. Then there is public attribution which refers to convincing the public with the attribution assessment. Having public backing in a democratic country allows the government to choose from a wider range of policy options. Credible public attribution enables the government to take certain steps, such as expelling diplomats or implementing economic sanctions, or at least facilitates such a response. Unlike in the case of transnational attribution (for which purpose allies might partially share sensitive information), most intelligence information and certain technical data cannot be shared with the public due to its classified and highly confidential nature. And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.\n# Attributing a cyber operation\n## Technical aspects of attribution\nFrom a technical point of view, measures for attribution need to be articulated in at least two dimensions. The first dimension distinguishes between those measures that can be established in the domestic IT systems and networks of a state ('inner scope measures') and those that need to exist or be built up in foreign IT systems ('outer scope measures'). The second dimension is composed of preventive and reactive measures. Preventive measures constantly observe, collect and store data that could be used to identify an attack that is detected or noticed at a later point in time. Reactive measures can be used to 'mark and track down an attacker' during an ongoing operation.\nInner and outer scope measures are both crucial to establishing credible attribution. Therefore, each state would need to have implemented its own set of data-gathering measures and/or allow defenders to trail attackers through their systems. This is clearly a challenge in the realm of international relations. Defining international standards for data-gathering measures, cooperation guidelines, information sharing and known communication channels would go a long way towards addressing this challenge and creating a common process to enable an international response. A first step towards such international cooperation has been made by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹ which became effective in 2004. Its agreements however do not apply to norms of state behaviour like espionage or military cyber activities and its practical aspects still need additional and more simplified cooperation\n¹ Council of Europe, Details of Treaty no.185, Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, November 23, 2001, https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185.\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nSpotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\nmeasures. The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017.² Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’,³ is currently the most recent development in this area.\n## Monitoring and logging\nA first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period⁴ play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network.⁵ The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred.⁶ Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n## Computer forensics\nWhen an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents. This\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nranges from the language, geolocation or working hours uncovered by this form of assessment to code fragments and linked IT-infrastructures, such as email addresses and device IPs. This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n## Passive tracking\nPassive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n## Active tracking\nStrong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and\n7. After incidents, detailed information about the tools of the 'defending' side are rarely revealed. Therefore it is difficult to point out a real-world example of honeypot usage. Press reports covering the recent attack against the Federal Foreign Office in Germany however stated that the investigating agencies are aware of the incident and are monitoring the attackers' activities which may be an indication that tools like honeypots or beacons had been used. For more details see \"Cyber-Espionage Hits Berlin - The Breach from the East,\" Der Spiegel, March 2018, http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cyber-espionage-likely-from-russia-targets-german-government-a-1196320.html.\n8. Honeypots can also be installed as a preventive measure but are most effective when tailor-made to a specific attack and its anticipated goals.\n9.

A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem.¹² While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution\nObtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots.¹³ Additionally, the public learned\n¹⁰ A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n¹¹ It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n¹² An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n¹³ United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\nThis content downloaded from\n144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nHACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES\nthat America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools.¹⁴ In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment,¹⁵ it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015.¹⁶ Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee¹⁷ because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report¹⁸ that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true.¹⁹ At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n14.

While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations, is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of\n20. An attack which while disguising the real perpetrator creates the impression that a third party is behind it.\n21. A third aspect could be 'for lulz' (for fun). While this kind of motivation has been in sharp decline in the past few years, groups such as Anonymous and LulzSsec have conducted a number of high-profile hacking operations with the apparent goal of ridiculing the victim.\n22.

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries.²⁵ False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia\nRussia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies.²⁶ Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable²⁷ in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’²⁸ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it.²⁹ Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task³⁰ which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation.³¹ Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness\n25.

A device which is only used for a particular attack and then trashed to hinder attribution. Derived from the concept of a ‘burner phone’.\n29. An attack might have several ‘origins’, which are intermediate systems exploited by the attacker to make an uninvolved third party look like the adversary. The ‘real origin’ of an attack is the point where the attack was started by the aggressor.\n30. Two case studies that show the complexity of this task, the different sources that have to be taken into account, the technical difficulties and challenges of tying this information together are the final report of Ralph Langner on Stuxnet, “To Kill a Centrifuge: A Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet’s Creators Tried to Achieve”, The Langner Group, November 2013, https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, as well as the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n31.

Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations³². There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.³³\nAdditionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory,³⁴ pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace,³⁵ it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report³⁶ and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings.³⁷ In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition\n32. For instance the hacking attacks against German governmental and parliamentary IT systems from 2015 and 2018 yielded no official reaction against the suggested attackers, whereas a hacking attack against the US-based company Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2014 almost immediately (in terms of days) resulted in US sanctions against North Korea.\n33.

Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing.

What are the tools and techniques that could help to identify the hackers who have conducted a cyber-operation? And why is credible attribution in the case of cyberattacks carried out or masterminded by Russia so challenging? These are the questions which this chapter aims to address in detail. However, before examining the technical, intelligence and geopolitical aspects of attribution, this chapter will first explain what attribution is and why it is important in the domain of cybersecurity ## Attribution: what it is and what for?\nThe term ‘attribution’ chiefly refers to a concept in international law that describes the process of identifying an attack or operation against a state. It is widely used in debates about the norms and rules of state behaviour and how they apply to cyberspace. Strictly speaking, attribution is usually used in the context of armed attacks and considered as one of the main legal requirements for the right of states to resort to force in self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter. Any state action that refers to this article has to be justified by the credible identification of the origins of an attack. Only by supplying such evidence, are states deemed to have the ‘inherent right of individual or collective self-defence’ and can therefore take steps towards an appropriate response to stop these threats. Attribution is also used to convince the state’s own government, public, and transnational partner organisations about the origin of a cyberattack. The threshold to convince these parties might be lower than the one required to trigger article 51.\nIn the case of national attribution policymakers and the executive have to be convinced about the origin of an attack in order to legitimise the use of offensive countermeasures.

Transnational attribution refers to convincing allies, bilaterally or as a whole (e.g. through NATO), about the validity of the attribution. This is essential in order to obtain political, diplomatic or other kinds of support from allies. It might not be possible to explicitly use or cite certain intelligence and technical data to convince them, as such data may be too highly classified. Naturally, this might limit the credibility of the attribution analysis. Then there is public attribution which refers to convincing the public with the attribution assessment. Having public backing in a democratic country allows the government to choose from a wider range of policy options. Credible public attribution enables the government to take certain steps, such as expelling diplomats or implementing economic sanctions, or at least facilitates such a response. Unlike in the case of transnational attribution (for which purpose allies might partially share sensitive information), most intelligence information and certain technical data cannot be shared with the public due to its classified and highly confidential nature. And this very limitation might undermine the credibility of public attribution.\n# Attributing a cyber operation ## Technical aspects of attribution From a technical point of view, measures for attribution need to be articulated in at least two dimensions. The first dimension distinguishes between those measures that can be established in the domestic IT systems and networks of a state ('inner scope measures') and those that need to exist or be built up in foreign IT systems ('outer scope measures'). The second dimension is composed of preventive and reactive measures. Preventive measures constantly observe, collect and store data that could be used to identify an attack that is detected or noticed at a later point in time. Reactive measures can be used to 'mark and track down an attacker' during an ongoing operation.\nInner and outer scope measures are both crucial to establishing credible attribution. Therefore, each state would need to have implemented its own set of data-gathering measures and/or allow defenders to trail attackers through their systems. This is clearly a challenge in the realm of international relations. Defining international standards for data-gathering measures, cooperation guidelines, information sharing and known communication channels would go a long way towards addressing this challenge and creating a common process to enable an international response. A first step towards such international cooperation has been made by the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime¹ which became effective in 2004. Its agreements however do not apply to norms of state behaviour like espionage or military cyber activities and its practical aspects still need additional and more simplified cooperation ¹ Council of Europe, Details of Treaty no.185, Convention on Cybercrime, Budapest, November 23, 2001, https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace measures. The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017.² Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’,³ is currently the most recent development in this area.\n## Monitoring and logging A first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period⁴ play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network.⁵ The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred.⁶ Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n## Computer forensics When an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents.

This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n## Passive tracking Passive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n## Active tracking Strong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace the question whether the attributed system had been used intentionally for the attack or whether it had been exploited.¹⁰ Another approach that enables monitoring an attack but avoids the risks of hack-back is to deliberately become one of the exploited systems that the attacker is using – similar to the honeypot approach.\n## Assembling the puzzle All these approaches can help a defender to collect data and information about the tactics, the tools and the different steps of an attack in order to compare them to known capacities of threat actors and the sophistication and methods attested in former incidents.¹¹ It is important to bear in mind that while each of these individual pieces of information can be a lead to the attacker, they can also be manipulated or crafted to leave misleading tracks which could potentially incriminate a third party. A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem.¹² While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution Obtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots.¹³ Additionally, the public learned ¹⁰ A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n¹¹ It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n¹² An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398. See: https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf.\n¹³ United States of America v. Internet Research Agency LLC et al., Case 1:18-cr-00032-DLF, filed on 16 February 16, 2018, https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms HACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES that America's National Security Agency is actively tracking various cyber threat actors via signals intelligence tools.¹⁴ In the case of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment,¹⁵ it was rumoured that American intelligence agencies had access to the network from which the attack originated and therefore were swiftly able to attribute it to North Korea. More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015.¹⁶ Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee¹⁷ because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report¹⁸ that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true.¹⁹ At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace # Geopolitics of attribution Geopolitics might only play a minor role in the attribution of cyber operations but this dimension should not be disregarded. While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms HACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES the world (instead of towards Russia). If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries.²⁵ False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia Russia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies.²⁶ Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable²⁷ in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’²⁸ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it.²⁹ Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task³⁰ which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation.³¹ Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace of the information about a cyberattack raises the risks of misunderstandings, miscalculations, misinterpretations and wrong responses, especially when other means of crisis communication or confidence-building measures between the adversaries are missing. Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations³². There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.³³ Additionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory,³⁴ pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace,³⁵ it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report³⁶ and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings.³⁷ In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition This content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms HACKS, LEAKS AND DISRUPTIONS | RUSSIAN CYBER STRATEGIES of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Enabling states to conduct more severe responses to cyberattacks would require public and international attribution. This in turn leads to a Catch-22 situation in intelligence sharing. Pointing the finger at the usual suspect without credible attribution when a cyberattack occurs not only further emboldens Russia in its projection of power (while it continues to deny responsibility) but fails to sufficiently convince the public or the international community.\nThis pattern of accusation and denial underlines again the necessity for binding international rules of state behaviour in cyberspace that include a commitment to the validity of due diligence principles in this domain. This would provide a strong basis for enforceable regimes of international law in cyberspace.\nThis content downloaded from 144.82.114.192 on Wed, 24 Apr 2024 15:48:35 +00:00 All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms"

The United Nations had been moving in a similar direction until its group of government experts (UN GGE) failed to reach consensus in 2017.² Microsoft's private initiative, the ‘Digital Geneva Convention’,³ is currently the most recent development in this area.\n\n## Monitoring and logging\n\nA first and essential preventive approach involves technical measures that monitor access to IT systems, the connections and data transferred between them as well as user-performed operations like creating, editing, copying or deleting files. The level of detail of the collected data and the retention period⁴ play a crucial role because in the absence of these elements investigations of attacks may not be pursued effectively. On the other hand, however, these same elements constitute a sensitive area in terms of data privacy. This issue has recently been debated in Germany, when allegedly Russian attackers broke into the Federal Foreign Office and undermined security mechanisms set in place by the secure government network.⁵ The data storage is considered sufficient when logged information covers the entire attack within a specific system. This enables the defender to consolidate a detailed timeline about the attacker’s actions, what the origin of the attack was, what data has been extracted and to which location the stolen data has been transferred.⁶ Additionally, the logged information needs to be stored in a secure and tamperproof way to prevent attackers from erasing their digital footprints.\n\n## Computer forensics\n\nWhen an attack has been detected, there is a range of possible reactive measures that can help in identifying the attacker. Besides analysing the collected data to trace the attacker’s operations history, other measures are the search and collection of software or software fragments that attackers have left on the compromised system to perform their unauthorised activities. These tools are often handcrafted and form part of larger toolsets. They are frequently reused for different operations over a period of several years. A software code analysis of these tools can be instrumental in detecting similarities and establishing connections with former incidents.

This analysis therefore helps to identify familiar tactics and hacking approaches, linking them to known malicious actors.\n\n## Passive tracking\n\nPassive tracking gives the defender additional information to potentially identify the attacker. While the attack is still in progress valuable information and evidence can be collected if the defender is able to observe the attacker's operations. This can be achieved by luring the attacker with so-called 'honeypots': systems or flaws that are easy to exploit and therefore will probably be targeted by the attacker. If the attacker takes the bait, the honeypot enables the defender to monitor all of the attacker's actions.7 A similar approach is the presentation of manipulated documents, relevant data or information that an attacker is potentially looking for and which contain malicious code, specific digital fingerprints or slightly manipulated information that can later be used to identify the data when it resurfaces.8 These so-called 'beacons' might also send back the IP address of the systems to which they have been transferred, which could reveal the original location of the attacker.\n\n## Active tracking\n\nStrong evidence about the origin of an attack can be gathered by tracing back the attacker to the IT system where the connections or the controlling commands for the attack originate. Common attack approaches often use a so-called command and control (C2 or C&amp;C) infrastructure, where specific computers are used to coordinate the attack and collect the stolen data. In order to identify the attacker it is necessary to monitor and gather information about user operations from these specific systems either through hacking them or through international cooperation with the states where the compromised devices are located. The former strategy is known as 'hackback' or 'active defence' and has drawbacks that need to be considered.9 These disadvantages are for example misinterpretations and wrongful attribution due to insufficient information, the risks of falling for deliberately created 'false flags' and\n\n7. After incidents, detailed information about the tools of the 'defending' side are rarely revealed. Therefore it is difficult to point out a real-world example of honeypot usage. Press reports covering the recent attack against the Federal Foreign Office in Germany however stated that the investigating agencies are aware of the incident and are monitoring the attackers' activities which may be an indication that tools like honeypots or beacons had been used. For more details see \"Cyber-Espionage Hits Berlin - The Breach from the East,\" Der Spiegel, March 2018, http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cyber-espionage-likely-from-russia-targets-german-government-a-1196320.html.\n\n8.

    "Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\n\nthe question whether the attributed system had been used intentionally for the attack or whether it had been exploited.¹⁰ Another approach that enables monitoring an attack but avoids the risks of hack-back is to deliberately become one of the exploited systems that the attacker is using – similar to the honeypot approach.\n\n## Assembling the puzzle\n\nAll these approaches can help a defender to collect data and information about the tactics, the tools and the different steps of an attack in order to compare them to known capacities of threat actors and the sophistication and methods attested in former incidents.¹¹ It is important to bear in mind that while each of these individual pieces of information can be a lead to the attacker, they can also be manipulated or crafted to leave misleading tracks which could potentially incriminate a third party. A consolidated and coherent analysis needs data collected through a range of various measures. It is certainly possible to conduct such a technical analysis when time is not a problem.¹² While in certain scenarios, such as espionage operations, attribution of an attack might not be time-sensitive, other instances exist where time is a critical factor – for example if a hack-back needs to be conducted. Moreover, during military conflict, time might be of the essence but thorough technical attribution takes time and needs to be complemented by an analysis of the geopolitical context in which the attack takes place as well as by intelligence findings.\n\n## Intelligence aspects of attribution\n\nObtaining all kinds of intelligence, especially human intelligence and signal intelligence, is crucial to help establish the attribution of cyberattacks. Such intelligence can be gathered through a state's own means or accessed via shared resources by allies. Intelligence can help to attribute one attack or an entire set of attacks in combination with the technical aspects. If for example a technical attribution analysis reveals that certain cyber operations are linked to each other – e.g. because they rely on the same infrastructure – and intelligence can link one of those operations to the perpetrator, an entire campaign of cyberattacks might be unravelled. The indictment filed by the US Special Counsel investigator Robert Mueller for example, in the inquiry into Russian interference in the presidential election, shows that access to email accounts provided the investigators with useful intelligence, enabling them to connect certain dots.¹³ Additionally, the public learned\n\n¹⁰ A common and slightly overused example is that of a hospital IT system that may have been hacked itself and used by the attacker as a hub to indirectly perform another cyberattack. Any offensive countermeasures that disrupt the hospital’s services would impair important primary tasks and could result in injuries to human life.\n\n¹¹ It is important to point out that although still only a limited number of state actors have sufficient offensive cyber capacities, their number is rising. For example North Korea has developed significant cyber power over the last year with – compared to conventional military armament – few financial resources.\n\n¹² An example is the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units” which analysed and presented forensically detailed data and evidence about the Chinese state-driven cyber espionage programme about the PLA Unit 61398.

More information was revealed about Dutch intelligence services which were tracking the Russian hacking group ‘Cozy Bear’ at least between 2014 and 2015.¹⁶ Hackers from the domestic Dutch intelligence agency AIVD were able to witness and monitor the launch of cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee¹⁷ because they had access to the network from which this operation was launched. AIVD also had access to security cameras monitoring the offices from which those attacks were conducted, conveniently allowing them to compare the pictures taken with those of known spies. This operation is likely responsible for the strongest proof of a Russian cyber aggression that has ever been obtained and found its way into the public sphere.\n\nAlthough crucial to solving the challenge, the intelligence component has been the most underrated aspect in the public debate. The reason for that is the classification of intelligence materials and thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a declassified intelligence report¹⁸ that was supposed to convince the public of Russia’s guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect because – due to declassification – the public report no longer contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not know or that it is not true.¹⁹ At the end of the day, it is the state’s strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed within the realms of possibility. Whether that proof can be presented to international organisations (e.g. UN, NATO) and/or the public or not is a different story as this would likely mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being effective in the future. If attackers follow the counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid them if possible.\n\n14.

    "Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\n\n# Geopolitics of attribution\n\nGeopolitics might only play a minor role in the attribution of cyber operations but this dimension should not be disregarded. While a thorough analysis of the technical aspects and solid intelligence can clearly provide hard facts and concrete evidence when it comes to attribution, a geopolitical assessment can help validate the overall process of attribution. A geopolitical assessment ultimately focuses on the attacker's motivation and hinges on two questions: cui bono? ('who benefits?') and 'was it a -false flag-20 operation?'21 It is rare for an actor to take responsibility for a cyberattack.22 Even then, the admission has to be vetted and treated with a certain amount of scepticism because it might just be part of a deception strategy. Cui bono? asks the question who would directly and most significantly benefit from the attack. Such an analysis can factor in various political aspects, such as ongoing conflicts, current negotiations or recent events. Findings of the technical analysis, such as what documents were stolen and which positions the employees whose computers were breached held in the organisation, add value to an assessment. A major reason why Russia has been blamed for so many attacks in recent years is that it stood to gain from all of them, assuming that Russia's main goals are to destabilise Western democracies and project power partly in an endeavour by the Kremlin to divert attention from the country's own domestic problems. The shortcoming of that assumption in terms of attribution is that it is overly broad and therefore involves the risk that Russia is automatically blamed for most cyberattacks.\n\nThe second aspect of a geopolitical assessment, false flag operations,[23] is straightforward because it asks a similar question: who benefits from the cyberattack in a case where another and/or the most obvious actor identified by a cui bono assessment will be blamed for the attack? Many of the indicators examined in a technical analysis, such as timestamps, language configurations, comments or hidden pictures in the code, can be easily manipulated to point in a certain direction. Using a geopolitical cover at the same time makes a false flag operation even more effective. A notable example of this was the alleged Russian cyber operation 'Olympic Destroyer' which not only relied on borrowing technical elements from previous North Korean cyber operations but targeted the Winter Olympics in South Korea[24] at a crucial moment in the North Korean-South Korean and American diplomatic relationship. If Russia was indeed behind it, this false flag operation was definitely smart. If North Korea is blamed for the attack, the relationship between the two Koreas would further deteriorate, forcing the United States to devote more of its attention to that part of\n\n20. An attack which while disguising the real perpetrator creates the impression that a third party is behind it.\n21. A third aspect could be 'for lulz' (for fun). While this kind of motivation has been in sharp decline in the past few years, groups such as Anonymous and LulzSsec have conducted a number of high-profile hacking operations with the apparent goal of ridiculing the victim.\n22.

If Russia is blamed for the attack, it can further its agenda of power projection and at the same time undermine public confidence in attribution in democratic countries.²⁵ False flag operations add an additional layer of complexity to an already complex phenomenon.\n\n# Why it is problematic to point to Russia\n\nRussia has repeatedly been blamed for cyberattacks in the past decade. Every other operation is currently linked to Russia by politicians, the media or IT security companies.²⁶ Some of the attribution might be correct, some might be wrong. The challenge here is not attribution but credible attribution. Credible attribution does not only mean getting the technical, geopolitical and intelligence aspects of attribution right, it also means convincing the target audience.\n\nWhereas attributing the source of an armed attack is possible for missiles or conventional military forces, such attribution is arguably nearly impossible or considered impracticable²⁷ in the case of attacks carried out via cyberspace as described earlier. Cyberspace offers perfect conditions for attackers to obfuscate their tracks and deceive the defenders and forensics. Attackers could use uninvolved third party IT infrastructure – or could fly to a different country with a ‘burner laptop’²⁸ – to conduct an attack. A targeted victim can only immediately identify the last element of the chain of computers used in the attack but not the origin behind it.²⁹ Strong empirical attribution would need to identify every device in the attack chain, and gather and analyse available traces to forensically link them to the real origin of the attack. This is a complex task³⁰ which is challenging even under optimal conditions where every IT system within the described chain contains traces of the attacker and the victim is able to gather these data via international cooperation.³¹ Such a task will not work in specific conflict situations where an immediate response is necessary and ‘conclusions shortcuts’ are dangerous because the ambiguity and incompleteness\n\n25.

An attack might have several ‘origins’, which are intermediate systems exploited by the attacker to make an uninvolved third party look like the adversary. The ‘real origin’ of an attack is the point where the attack was started by the aggressor.\n30. Two case studies that show the complexity of this task, the different sources that have to be taken into account, the technical difficulties and challenges of tying this information together are the final report of Ralph Langner on Stuxnet, “To Kill a Centrifuge: A Technical Analysis of What Stuxnet’s Creators Tried to Achieve”, The Langner Group, November 2013, https://www.langner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/to-kill-a-centrifuge.pdf, as well as the 2013 Mandiant report “APT1 - Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units,” https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n31.

    "Spotting the bear: credible attribution and Russian operations in cyberspace\n\nof the information about a cyberattack raises the risks of misunderstandings, miscalculations, misinterpretations and wrong responses, especially when other means of crisis communication or confidence-building measures between the adversaries are missing. Besides such ‘hard facts’, prior events have shown that attribution is still ultimately a political decision based on information collated by intelligence and security agencies or influenced by foreign policy interests and considerations³². There are only very few instances in which states based a public response, e.g. sanctions, on the findings of an attribution assessment. One of them was the US response to Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.³³\n\nAdditionally, states that are blamed for an attack often distance themselves from the hacking group that conducted the operation and deny any official involvement or control of the group. Even though the UN GGE decided to hold states accountable for cyber operations conducted from within their territory,³⁴ pledging to help the investigation with any means possible will take some pressure off a state that finds itself under suspicion. Plus, linking a cyberattack to a hacker group is one thing, linking that hacker group or a specific incident to a state and especially to a particular governmental or military order as is required by the UN Charter is quite another. Even if due diligence is a commonly accepted principle in cyberspace,³⁵ it is not enforced in the current public debates on potential cyberattacks from Russia. In fact, prior to the establishment of a military cyber unit in 2017, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was responsible for overseeing Russia’s cyber capabilities.\n\nFrom the perspective of the international community and as described earlier in respect to international law, attribution and accusations in specific conflicts need to be based on a credible, evidence-based argumentation that has to be made by the affected state. But so far few cases exist where such evidence that points strongly to Russia had been made public. Two instances which provided the most public information about a state-backed attribution pointing towards Russia are the US Director of National Intelligence’s report³⁶ and the Dutch domestic intelligence AIVD findings.³⁷ In yet another milestone development, several countries – among them the US, the Netherlands and the UK – simultaneously went public in October 2018, jointly attributing cyber operations to the (allegedly) Russian-sponsored GRU hacking unit APT28. The attribution included cyber operations carried out against the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Organisation for the Prohibition\n\n32. For instance the hacking attacks against German governmental and parliamentary IT systems from 2015 and 2018 yielded no official reaction against the suggested attackers, whereas a hacking attack against the US-based company Sony Pictures Entertainment from 2014 almost immediately (in terms of days) resulted in US sanctions against North Korea.\n\n33.
