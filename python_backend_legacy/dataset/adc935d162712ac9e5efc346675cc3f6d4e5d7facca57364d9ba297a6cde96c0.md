Eichensehr*\n# Abstract\nIn 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n# 1 Introduction\nThe cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

This article considers established and emerging legal rules and concludes, based on the publicly available facts, that SolarWinds likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands.⁶ The article closes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in the ongoing debates about the scope of international law governing cyber operations.\n# 2 The SolarWinds Incident and States' Responses\nThe SolarWinds incident began with a supply chain hack: Russian government hackers compromised the update process for SolarWinds’ Orion network-monitoring software and caused 18,000 of the company’s customers to download an update containing malicious code.⁷ The hackers then selected a smaller number of the breached entities for additional targeting,⁸ using their initial access via Orion to reach the\n² See, e.g., E.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency immediately issued an emergency directive instructing US government agencies to disconnect devices affected by the compromise and later provided guidance on reinstalling updated versions of SolarWinds Orion, along with other actions to harden systems against further intrusions.¹¹ On 15 April 2021, the USA attributed ‘the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures’ to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian) and imposed sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, including the SVR, as well as certain Russian companies that support those intelligence services.¹² In explaining the sanctions, the White House highlighted the wide scope of the intrusion, which gave the SVR ‘the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide’, and the ‘undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident’.¹³ Pointing to ‘Russia’s history of... reckless and disruptive cyber operations’, the US Treasury Department emphasized that ‘[t]he SVR has put at risk the global technology supply chain’ and caused victims to spend ‘millions of dollars’ in remediation.¹⁴\nHowever, the USA did not call the hack a violation of international law.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not.¹⁶ Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations\nAs far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'.¹⁷ At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted.¹⁸ This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence. It concludes with a brief word about international human rights law.\nby the High Representative on Behalf of the European Union Expressing Solidarity with the United States on the Impact of the SolarWinds Cyber Operation', Council of the European Union (15 April 2021), available at www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/15/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-expressing-solidarity-with-the-united-states-on-the-impact-of-the-solarwinds-cyber-operation; 'North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia', North Atlantic Treaty Organization (15 April 2021), available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_183168.htm; 'Russia: UK and US Expose Global Campaign of Malign Activity by Russian Intelligence Services', UK Government (15 April 2021), available at www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services.\n¹⁶ See Eichensehr, 'Defend Forward and Attribution', in J.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), at 169 (hereinafter Tallinn Manual 2.0) ('customary international law does not prohibit espionage per se').\n¹⁸ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 170 (whether a cyber-espionage operation is lawful 'depends on whether the way in which the operation is carried out violates any international law obligations that bind the State'). The SolarWinds operation may well have violated international norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace.

A/76/135, 14 July 2021, at 8-17.\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1267\n# A Prohibition on the Use of Force\nThe SolarWinds incident did not constitute a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law. Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case,¹⁹ states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force.²⁰ The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'.²¹ The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.²²\n# B Prohibition on Intervention\nCyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention.²³ The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not.²⁴ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs\n¹⁹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

But see D.B. Hollis and T. van Bentham, 'What Would Happen If States Started Looking at Cyber Operations as a \"Threat\" to Use Force?', Lawfare (30 March 2021), available at www.lawfareblog.com/ what-would-happen-if-states-started-looking-cyber-operations-threat-use-force.\n²³ Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n²⁴ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 57 (Netherlands) ('[t]he precise definition of coercion, and thus of unauthorised intervention, has not yet fully crystallised in international law'); ibid., at 116 (United Kingdom) (describing 'the precise boundaries of' the prohibition on intervention as 'the subject of on-going debate'); 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 25 ('further State practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time').\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nwithout outside interference'.²⁵ Intervention has two elements: (i) it must ‘bear[] on matters in which each State is permitted... to decide freely’, including ‘the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and (ii) it must involve ‘coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.²⁶ The first element is often described as involving a state’s domaine réservé,²⁷ and it is somewhat clearer than the second element – coercion – which ‘is not defined in international law’.²⁸\nAlthough the SolarWinds incident arguably interfered with the US domaine réservé, given the compromises of numerous US government departments, it did not coerce the USA and thus does not constitute intervention. The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs.²⁹ Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention.³⁰ Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action.³¹ The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’.³² Other frequent examples include interfering with the\n25 Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n26 Ibid., para. 205.\n27 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 34 (Germany).\n28 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 317.\n29 Ibid.\n30 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 34 (Germany); ibid., at 57 (Netherlands); Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 317, 321.\n31 See, e.g., Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 323 (‘[c]yber espionage per se, as distinct from the underlying acts that enable the espionage... does not qualify as intervention because it lacks a coercive element’); Rt. Hon. S. Braverman, ‘International Law in Future Frontiers’, UK Government (19 May 2022), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/international-law-in-future-frontiers (‘[i]t is this coercive element that most obviously distinguishes an intervention prohibited under international law from, for example, more routine and legitimate information-gathering and influencing activities that States carry out as part of international relations’).\n32 GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia). For similar views, see ibid., at 34 (Germany); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, at para. 24; ‘The Application of International Law to\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269\noperations of a state's legislature,³³ disrupting provision of health care³⁴ and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure.³⁵ All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n## C Violation of Sovereignty\nWhether cyber operations below the use of force threshold and outside of prohibited intervention violate international law has become a hotly contested issue. In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act.³⁶ A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty.³⁷ On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.³⁸\nThe US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position.³⁹ In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’.⁴⁰ Given divergences among states about the existence\nState Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n³³ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n³⁴ Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n³⁵ See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n³⁷ ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n³⁸ Rt. Hon. J. Wright, ‘Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century’, UK Government (23 May 2018), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century. The United Kingdom reaffirmed this position in May 2022. Braverman, supra note 31.\n³⁹ P.C. Ney Jr., ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at U.S. Cyber Command Legal Conference’, US Department of Defense (2 March 2020), available at www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2099378/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference/.\n⁴⁰ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 140 (USA).\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nof, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.⁴¹\nEven assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’.⁴² With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty.⁴³ SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty.⁴⁴ Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.⁴⁵\nTurning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’.⁴⁶ The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.⁴⁷\nConcluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty.⁴⁸ Such views would make little sense if efforts like\n⁴¹ ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n⁴³ Ibid., at 20–21.\n⁴⁴ Ibid., at 21.\n⁴⁵ ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n⁴⁶ Schmitt, supra note 6.\n⁴⁷ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴⁸ See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271\nreinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.⁴⁹\n## D Due Diligence\nSome commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence.⁵⁰ Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁵¹ Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations.⁵² States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence,⁵³ but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding.⁵⁴ Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.⁵⁵\nEven assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’.⁵⁶ In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing\n⁴⁹ Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n⁵⁰ Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n⁵¹ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v.

The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nstrange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57\nMoreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law\nIn the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63\nalso GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n57 Due diligence fits more naturally in the context of criminal ransomware emanating from Russia.

There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect,⁶⁴ and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation.⁶⁵ Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n# 4 Conclusion\nThe SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace.⁶⁶ Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles\n⁶⁴ See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n⁶⁵ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 13, Norm 13(g); see also *ibid.* at 13 (noting that each state determines 'the structural, technical, organizational, legislative and regulatory measures necessary to protect their critical infrastructure').\n⁶⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve⁶⁷ and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do.\n67 Coco, Dias and van Benthem, supra note 50.",

Eichensehr*\n# Abstract\nIn 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n# 1 Introduction\nThe cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

The hacking campaign that the US government called ‘an intelligence gathering effort’ and that one cyber-security expert more bluntly deemed ‘one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time’ roiled victims for months and resulted in the USA sanctioning Russia.\nThe SolarWinds incident violated US law, but did it also violate international law? This article considers established and emerging legal rules and concludes, based on the publicly available facts, that SolarWinds likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article closes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in the ongoing debates about the scope of international law governing cyber operations.\n# 2 The SolarWinds Incident and States' Responses\nThe SolarWinds incident began with a supply chain hack: Russian government hackers compromised the update process for SolarWinds’ Orion network-monitoring software and caused 18,000 of the company’s customers to download an update containing malicious code. The hackers then selected a smaller number of the breached entities for additional targeting, using their initial access via Orion to reach the\n See, e.g., E. Nakashima and C.

US officials ultimately assessed that ‘9 federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies’ suffered such advanced intrusions.\nThe US government’s response rolled out over several months. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency immediately issued an emergency directive instructing US government agencies to disconnect devices affected by the compromise and later provided guidance on reinstalling updated versions of SolarWinds Orion, along with other actions to harden systems against further intrusions. On 15 April 2021, the USA attributed ‘the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures’ to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian) and imposed sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, including the SVR, as well as certain Russian companies that support those intelligence services. In explaining the sanctions, the White House highlighted the wide scope of the intrusion, which gave the SVR ‘the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide’, and the ‘undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident’. Pointing to ‘Russia’s history of... reckless and disruptive cyber operations’, the US Treasury Department emphasized that ‘[t]he SVR has put at risk the global technology supply chain’ and caused victims to spend ‘millions of dollars’ in remediation.\nHowever, the USA did not call the hack a violation of international law. Neither did numerous US allies, including Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United Kingdom (UK), all of which confirmed the attribution and condemned Russia’s behaviour as malicious, destabilizing or malign.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not. Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations\nAs far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'. At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted. This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence. It concludes with a brief word about international human rights law.\nby the High Representative on Behalf of the European Union Expressing Solidarity with the United States on the Impact of the SolarWinds Cyber Operation', Council of the European Union (15 April 2021), available at www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/15/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-expressing-solidarity-with-the-united-states-on-the-impact-of-the-solarwinds-cyber-operation; 'North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia', North Atlantic Treaty Organization (15 April 2021), available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_183168.htm; 'Russia: UK and US Expose Global Campaign of Malign Activity by Russian Intelligence Services', UK Government (15 April 2021), available at www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services.\n See Eichensehr, 'Defend Forward and Attribution', in J.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), at 169 (hereinafter Tallinn Manual 2.0) ('customary international law does not prohibit espionage per se').\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 170 (whether a cyber-espionage operation is lawful 'depends on whether the way in which the operation is carried out violates any international law obligations that bind the State'). The SolarWinds operation may well have violated international norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace. See Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (hereinafter 2021 GGE Report), UN Doc. A/76/135, 14 July 2021, at 8-17.\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1267\n# A Prohibition on the Use of Force\nThe SolarWinds incident did not constitute a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law. Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case, states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force. The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'. The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.\n# B Prohibition on Intervention\nCyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention. The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Intervention has two elements: (i) it must ‘bear[] on matters in which each State is permitted... to decide freely’, including ‘the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and (ii) it must involve ‘coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’. The first element is often described as involving a state’s domaine réservé, and it is somewhat clearer than the second element – coercion – which ‘is not defined in international law’.\nAlthough the SolarWinds incident arguably interfered with the US domaine réservé, given the compromises of numerous US government departments, it did not coerce the USA and thus does not constitute intervention. The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs. Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention. Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action. The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’. Other frequent examples include interfering with the\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269\noperations of a state's legislature, disrupting provision of health care and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure. All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n## C Violation of Sovereignty\nWhether cyber operations below the use of force threshold and outside of prohibited intervention violate international law has become a hotly contested issue. In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act. A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty. On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.\nThe US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position. In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’.

The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’. With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty. SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty. Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.\nTurning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’. The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.\nConcluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty. Such views would make little sense if efforts like\n ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n Ibid., at 20–21.\n Ibid., at 21.\n ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n Schmitt, supra note 6.\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271\nreinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.\n## D Due Diligence\nSome commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence. Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations. States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence, but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding. Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.\nEven assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’. In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing\n Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nstrange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57\nMoreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law\nIn the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63\nalso GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273\nEven assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect, and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation. Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n# 4 Conclusion\nThe SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace. Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles\n See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n\n Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98*, 24 June 2013, para. 19.\n\nLegal/Illegal\nto play in this constitutional moment for the international law on cyber operations. Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do.",

Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case,¹⁹ states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force.²⁰ The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'.²¹ The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.²² # B Prohibition on Intervention Cyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention.²³ The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not.²⁴ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs ¹⁹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs.²⁹ Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention.³⁰ Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action.³¹ The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’.³² Other frequent examples include interfering with the Not Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269 operations of a state's legislature,³³ disrupting provision of health care³⁴ and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure.³⁵ All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n## C Violation of Sovereignty Whether cyber operations below the use of force threshold and outside of prohibited intervention violate international law has become a hotly contested issue. In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act.³⁶ A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty.³⁷ On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.³⁸ The US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position.³⁹ In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’.⁴⁰ Given divergences among states about the existence State Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n³³ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n³⁴ Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n³⁵ See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n³⁷ ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n³⁸ Rt. Hon. J. Wright, ‘Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century’, UK Government (23 May 2018), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century. The United Kingdom reaffirmed this position in May 2022. Braverman, supra note 31.\n³⁹ P.C. Ney Jr., ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at U.S. Cyber Command Legal Conference’, US Department of Defense (2 March 2020), available at www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2099378/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference/.\n⁴⁰ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 140 (USA).\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal of, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.⁴¹ Even assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’.⁴² With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty.⁴³ SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty.⁴⁴ Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.⁴⁵ Turning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’.⁴⁶ The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.⁴⁷ Concluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty.⁴⁸ Such views would make little sense if efforts like ⁴¹ ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n⁴³ Ibid., at 20–21.\n⁴⁴ Ibid., at 21.\n⁴⁵ ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n⁴⁶ Schmitt, supra note 6.\n⁴⁷ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴⁸ See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271 reinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.⁴⁹ ## D Due Diligence Some commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence.⁵⁰ Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁵¹ Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations.⁵² States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence,⁵³ but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding.⁵⁴ Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.⁵⁵ Even assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’.⁵⁶ In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing ⁴⁹ Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n⁵⁰ Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n⁵¹ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n⁵² See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n⁵³ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 10 (‘Norm 13(c) States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using [information and communications technologies]’).\n⁵⁴ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n⁵⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see EJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal strange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57 Moreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law In the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63 also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273 Even assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect,⁶⁴ and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation.⁶⁵ Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.",
    "# 4 Conclusion The SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.": "The legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace.⁶⁶ Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles ⁶⁴ See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n⁶⁵ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 13, Norm 13(g); see also *ibid.* at 13 (noting that each state determines 'the structural, technical, organizational, legislative and regulatory measures necessary to protect their critical infrastructure').\n⁶⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98*, 24 June 2013, para. 19.\nLegal/Illegal to play in this constitutional moment for the international law on cyber operations. Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve⁶⁷ and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do."

Eichensehr*\n# Abstract\nIn 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n# 1 Introduction\nThe cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

The hacking campaign that the US government called ‘an intelligence gathering effort’ and that one cyber-security expert more bluntly deemed ‘one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time’ roiled victims for months and resulted in the USA sanctioning Russia.\nThe SolarWinds incident violated US law, but did it also violate international law? This article considers established and emerging legal rules and concludes, based on the publicly available facts, that SolarWinds likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article closes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in the ongoing debates about the scope of international law governing cyber operations.\n# 2 The SolarWinds Incident and States' Responses\nThe SolarWinds incident began with a supply chain hack: Russian government hackers compromised the update process for SolarWinds’ Orion network-monitoring software and caused 18,000 of the company’s customers to download an update containing malicious code. The hackers then selected a smaller number of the breached entities for additional targeting, using their initial access via Orion to reach the\n See, e.g., E. Nakashima and C.

US officials ultimately assessed that ‘9 federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies’ suffered such advanced intrusions.\nThe US government’s response rolled out over several months. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency immediately issued an emergency directive instructing US government agencies to disconnect devices affected by the compromise and later provided guidance on reinstalling updated versions of SolarWinds Orion, along with other actions to harden systems against further intrusions. On 15 April 2021, the USA attributed ‘the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures’ to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian) and imposed sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, including the SVR, as well as certain Russian companies that support those intelligence services. In explaining the sanctions, the White House highlighted the wide scope of the intrusion, which gave the SVR ‘the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide’, and the ‘undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident’. Pointing to ‘Russia’s history of... reckless and disruptive cyber operations’, the US Treasury Department emphasized that ‘[t]he SVR has put at risk the global technology supply chain’ and caused victims to spend ‘millions of dollars’ in remediation.\nHowever, the USA did not call the hack a violation of international law. Neither did numerous US allies, including Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United Kingdom (UK), all of which confirmed the attribution and condemned Russia’s behaviour as malicious, destabilizing or malign.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not. Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations\nAs far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'. At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted. This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence. It concludes with a brief word about international human rights law.\nby the High Representative on Behalf of the European Union Expressing Solidarity with the United States on the Impact of the SolarWinds Cyber Operation', Council of the European Union (15 April 2021), available at www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/15/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-expressing-solidarity-with-the-united-states-on-the-impact-of-the-solarwinds-cyber-operation; 'North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia', North Atlantic Treaty Organization (15 April 2021), available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_183168.htm; 'Russia: UK and US Expose Global Campaign of Malign Activity by Russian Intelligence Services', UK Government (15 April 2021), available at www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services.\n See Eichensehr, 'Defend Forward and Attribution', in J.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), at 169 (hereinafter Tallinn Manual 2.0) ('customary international law does not prohibit espionage per se').\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 170 (whether a cyber-espionage operation is lawful 'depends on whether the way in which the operation is carried out violates any international law obligations that bind the State').

A/76/135, 14 July 2021, at 8-17.\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1267\n# A Prohibition on the Use of Force\nThe SolarWinds incident did not constitute a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law. Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case, states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force. The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'. The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.\n# B Prohibition on Intervention\nCyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention. The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

But see D.B. Hollis and T. van Bentham, 'What Would Happen If States Started Looking at Cyber Operations as a \"Threat\" to Use Force?', Lawfare (30 March 2021), available at www.lawfareblog.com/ what-would-happen-if-states-started-looking-cyber-operations-threat-use-force.\n Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 57 (Netherlands) ('[t]he precise definition of coercion, and thus of unauthorised intervention, has not yet fully crystallised in international law'); ibid., at 116 (United Kingdom) (describing 'the precise boundaries of' the prohibition on intervention as 'the subject of on-going debate'); 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 25 ('further State practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time').\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nwithout outside interference'. Intervention has two elements: (i) it must ‘bear[] on matters in which each State is permitted... to decide freely’, including ‘the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and (ii) it must involve ‘coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’. The first element is often described as involving a state’s domaine réservé, and it is somewhat clearer than the second element – coercion – which ‘is not defined in international law’.\nAlthough the SolarWinds incident arguably interfered with the US domaine réservé, given the compromises of numerous US government departments, it did not coerce the USA and thus does not constitute intervention. The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs. Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention. Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action. The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’. Other frequent examples include interfering with the\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269\noperations of a state's legislature, disrupting provision of health care and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure. All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n## C Violation of Sovereignty\nWhether cyber operations below the use of force threshold and outside of prohibited intervention violate international law has become a hotly contested issue. In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act. A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty. On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.\nThe US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position. In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’. Given divergences among states about the existence\nState Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n Rt. Hon. J. Wright, ‘Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century’, UK Government (23 May 2018), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century. The United Kingdom reaffirmed this position in May 2022. Braverman, supra note 31.\n P.C. Ney Jr., ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at U.S. Cyber Command Legal Conference’, US Department of Defense (2 March 2020), available at www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2099378/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference/.\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 140 (USA).\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nof, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.\nEven assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’. With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty. SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty. Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.\nTurning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’. The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.\nConcluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty. Such views would make little sense if efforts like\n ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n Ibid., at 20–21.\n Ibid., at 21.\n ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n Schmitt, supra note 6.\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271\nreinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.\n## D Due Diligence\nSome commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence. Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations. States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence, but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding. Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.\nEven assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’. In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing\n Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nstrange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57\nMoreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law\nIn the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63\nalso GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273\nEven assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect, and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation. Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n# 4 Conclusion\nThe SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace. Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles\n See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n\n Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98*, 24 June 2013, para. 19.\n\nLegal/Illegal\nto play in this constitutional moment for the international law on cyber operations. Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do.",

Eichensehr*\n# Abstract\nIn 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n# 1 Introduction\nThe cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

The hacking campaign that the US government called ‘an intelligence gathering effort’ and that one cyber-security expert more bluntly deemed ‘one of the most effective cyber-espionage campaigns of all time’ roiled victims for months and resulted in the USA sanctioning Russia.\nThe SolarWinds incident violated US law, but did it also violate international law? This article considers established and emerging legal rules and concludes, based on the publicly available facts, that SolarWinds likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article closes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in the ongoing debates about the scope of international law governing cyber operations.\n# 2 The SolarWinds Incident and States' Responses\nThe SolarWinds incident began with a supply chain hack: Russian government hackers compromised the update process for SolarWinds’ Orion network-monitoring software and caused 18,000 of the company’s customers to download an update containing malicious code. The hackers then selected a smaller number of the breached entities for additional targeting, using their initial access via Orion to reach the\n See, e.g., E. Nakashima and C.

US officials ultimately assessed that ‘9 federal agencies and about 100 private sector companies’ suffered such advanced intrusions.\nThe US government’s response rolled out over several months. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency immediately issued an emergency directive instructing US government agencies to disconnect devices affected by the compromise and later provided guidance on reinstalling updated versions of SolarWinds Orion, along with other actions to harden systems against further intrusions. On 15 April 2021, the USA attributed ‘the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures’ to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian) and imposed sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, including the SVR, as well as certain Russian companies that support those intelligence services. In explaining the sanctions, the White House highlighted the wide scope of the intrusion, which gave the SVR ‘the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide’, and the ‘undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident’. Pointing to ‘Russia’s history of... reckless and disruptive cyber operations’, the US Treasury Department emphasized that ‘[t]he SVR has put at risk the global technology supply chain’ and caused victims to spend ‘millions of dollars’ in remediation.\nHowever, the USA did not call the hack a violation of international law. Neither did numerous US allies, including Australia, Canada, the European Union and the United Kingdom (UK), all of which confirmed the attribution and condemned Russia’s behaviour as malicious, destabilizing or malign.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not. Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations\nAs far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'. At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted. This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence. It concludes with a brief word about international human rights law.\nby the High Representative on Behalf of the European Union Expressing Solidarity with the United States on the Impact of the SolarWinds Cyber Operation', Council of the European Union (15 April 2021), available at www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/15/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-expressing-solidarity-with-the-united-states-on-the-impact-of-the-solarwinds-cyber-operation; 'North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia', North Atlantic Treaty Organization (15 April 2021), available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_183168.htm; 'Russia: UK and US Expose Global Campaign of Malign Activity by Russian Intelligence Services', UK Government (15 April 2021), available at www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services.\n See Eichensehr, 'Defend Forward and Attribution', in J.

Schmitt (ed.), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2017), at 169 (hereinafter Tallinn Manual 2.0) ('customary international law does not prohibit espionage per se').\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 170 (whether a cyber-espionage operation is lawful 'depends on whether the way in which the operation is carried out violates any international law obligations that bind the State'). The SolarWinds operation may well have violated international norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace. See Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (hereinafter 2021 GGE Report), UN Doc. A/76/135, 14 July 2021, at 8-17.\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1267\n# A Prohibition on the Use of Force\nThe SolarWinds incident did not constitute a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law. Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case, states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force. The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'. The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.\n# B Prohibition on Intervention\nCyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention. The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not. In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs\n Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

But see D.B. Hollis and T. van Bentham, 'What Would Happen If States Started Looking at Cyber Operations as a \"Threat\" to Use Force?', Lawfare (30 March 2021), available at www.lawfareblog.com/ what-would-happen-if-states-started-looking-cyber-operations-threat-use-force.\n Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 57 (Netherlands) ('[t]he precise definition of coercion, and thus of unauthorised intervention, has not yet fully crystallised in international law'); ibid., at 116 (United Kingdom) (describing 'the precise boundaries of' the prohibition on intervention as 'the subject of on-going debate'); 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 25 ('further State practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time').\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nwithout outside interference'. Intervention has two elements: (i) it must ‘bear[] on matters in which each State is permitted... to decide freely’, including ‘the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and (ii) it must involve ‘coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’. The first element is often described as involving a state’s domaine réservé, and it is somewhat clearer than the second element – coercion – which ‘is not defined in international law’.\nAlthough the SolarWinds incident arguably interfered with the US domaine réservé, given the compromises of numerous US government departments, it did not coerce the USA and thus does not constitute intervention. The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs. Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention. Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action. The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’. Other frequent examples include interfering with the\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269\noperations of a state's legislature, disrupting provision of health care and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure. All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n## C Violation of Sovereignty\nWhether cyber operations below the use of force threshold and outside of prohibited intervention violate international law has become a hotly contested issue. In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act. A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty. On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.\nThe US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position. In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’. Given divergences among states about the existence\nState Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n Rt.

The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’. With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty. SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty. Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.\nTurning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’. The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.\nConcluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty. Such views would make little sense if efforts like\n ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n Ibid., at 20–21.\n Ibid., at 21.\n ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n Schmitt, supra note 6.\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271\nreinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.\n## D Due Diligence\nSome commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence. Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’. Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations. States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence, but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding. Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.\nEven assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’. In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing\n Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n\n GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nstrange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57\nMoreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law\nIn the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63\nalso GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273\nEven assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect, and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation. Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n# 4 Conclusion\nThe SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace. Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles\n See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n\n Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98*, 24 June 2013, para. 19.\n\nLegal/Illegal\nto play in this constitutional moment for the international law on cyber operations. Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do."

Eichensehr*\n# Abstract\nIn 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n# 1 Introduction\nThe cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

This article considers established and emerging legal rules and concludes, based on the publicly available facts, that SolarWinds likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands.⁶ The article closes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in the ongoing debates about the scope of international law governing cyber operations.\n# 2 The SolarWinds Incident and States' Responses\nThe SolarWinds incident began with a supply chain hack: Russian government hackers compromised the update process for SolarWinds’ Orion network-monitoring software and caused 18,000 of the company’s customers to download an update containing malicious code.⁷ The hackers then selected a smaller number of the breached entities for additional targeting,⁸ using their initial access via Orion to reach the\n² See, e.g., E.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency immediately issued an emergency directive instructing US government agencies to disconnect devices affected by the compromise and later provided guidance on reinstalling updated versions of SolarWinds Orion, along with other actions to harden systems against further intrusions.¹¹ On 15 April 2021, the USA attributed ‘the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures’ to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian) and imposed sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, including the SVR, as well as certain Russian companies that support those intelligence services.¹² In explaining the sanctions, the White House highlighted the wide scope of the intrusion, which gave the SVR ‘the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide’, and the ‘undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident’.¹³ Pointing to ‘Russia’s history of... reckless and disruptive cyber operations’, the US Treasury Department emphasized that ‘[t]he SVR has put at risk the global technology supply chain’ and caused victims to spend ‘millions of dollars’ in remediation.¹⁴\nHowever, the USA did not call the hack a violation of international law.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not.¹⁶ Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations\nAs far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'.¹⁷ At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted.¹⁸ This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence. It concludes with a brief word about international human rights law.\nby the High Representative on Behalf of the European Union Expressing Solidarity with the United States on the Impact of the SolarWinds Cyber Operation', Council of the European Union (15 April 2021), available at www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/15/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-expressing-solidarity-with-the-united-states-on-the-impact-of-the-solarwinds-cyber-operation; 'North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia', North Atlantic Treaty Organization (15 April 2021), available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_183168.htm; 'Russia: UK and US Expose Global Campaign of Malign Activity by Russian Intelligence Services', UK Government (15 April 2021), available at www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services.\n¹⁶ See Eichensehr, 'Defend Forward and Attribution', in J.

A/76/135, 14 July 2021, at 8-17.\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1267\n# A Prohibition on the Use of Force\nThe SolarWinds incident did not constitute a use of force in violation of Article 2(4) of the Charter of the United Nations and customary international law. Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case,¹⁹ states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force.²⁰ The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'.²¹ The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.²²\n# B Prohibition on Intervention\nCyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention.²³ The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not.²⁴ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs\n¹⁹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

But see D.B. Hollis and T. van Bentham, 'What Would Happen If States Started Looking at Cyber Operations as a \"Threat\" to Use Force?', Lawfare (30 March 2021), available at www.lawfareblog.com/ what-would-happen-if-states-started-looking-cyber-operations-threat-use-force.\n²³ Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n²⁴ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 57 (Netherlands) ('[t]he precise definition of coercion, and thus of unauthorised intervention, has not yet fully crystallised in international law'); ibid., at 116 (United Kingdom) (describing 'the precise boundaries of' the prohibition on intervention as 'the subject of on-going debate'); 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 25 ('further State practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time').\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nwithout outside interference'.²⁵ Intervention has two elements: (i) it must ‘bear[] on matters in which each State is permitted... to decide freely’, including ‘the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and (ii) it must involve ‘coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.²⁶ The first element is often described as involving a state’s domaine réservé,²⁷ and it is somewhat clearer than the second element – coercion – which ‘is not defined in international law’.²⁸\nAlthough the SolarWinds incident arguably interfered with the US domaine réservé, given the compromises of numerous US government departments, it did not coerce the USA and thus does not constitute intervention. The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs.²⁹ Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention.³⁰ Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action.³¹ The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’.³² Other frequent examples include interfering with the\n25 Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n26 Ibid., para. 205.\n27 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 34 (Germany).\n28 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 317.\n29 Ibid.\n30 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 34 (Germany); ibid., at 57 (Netherlands); Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 317, 321.\n31 See, e.g., Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 323 (‘[c]yber espionage per se, as distinct from the underlying acts that enable the espionage... does not qualify as intervention because it lacks a coercive element’); Rt.

In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act.³⁶ A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty.³⁷ On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.³⁸\nThe US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position.³⁹ In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’.⁴⁰ Given divergences among states about the existence\nState Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n³³ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n³⁴ Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n³⁵ See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n³⁷ ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n³⁸ Rt. Hon. J. Wright, ‘Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century’, UK Government (23 May 2018), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century. The United Kingdom reaffirmed this position in May 2022. Braverman, supra note 31.\n³⁹ P.C. Ney Jr., ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at U.S. Cyber Command Legal Conference’, US Department of Defense (2 March 2020), available at www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2099378/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference/.\n⁴⁰ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 140 (USA).\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nof, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.⁴¹\nEven assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’.⁴² With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty.⁴³ SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty.⁴⁴ Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.⁴⁵\nTurning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’.⁴⁶ The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.⁴⁷\nConcluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty.⁴⁸ Such views would make little sense if efforts like\n⁴¹ ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n⁴³ Ibid., at 20–21.\n⁴⁴ Ibid., at 21.\n⁴⁵ ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n⁴⁶ Schmitt, supra note 6.\n⁴⁷ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴⁸ See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271\nreinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.⁴⁹\n## D Due Diligence\nSome commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence.⁵⁰ Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁵¹ Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations.⁵² States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence,⁵³ but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding.⁵⁴ Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.⁵⁵\nEven assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’.⁵⁶ In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing\n⁴⁹ Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n⁵⁰ Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n⁵¹ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n⁵² See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n⁵³ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 10 (‘Norm 13(c) States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using [information and communications technologies]’).\n⁵⁴ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n⁵⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\nLegal/Illegal\nstrange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57\nMoreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law\nIn the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63\nalso GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n57 Due diligence fits more naturally in the context of criminal ransomware emanating from Russia. See Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, ‘The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace: The Regulation of Ransomware Operations’, para. 4, available at www.elac.ox.ac.uk/the-oxford-process/the-statements-overview/the-oxford-statement-on-ransomware-operations/.\n58 See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 34; but see ibid., at 36 (‘[t]he precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law’); Jensen and Watts, ‘Due Diligence and Defend Forward’, in J. Goldsmith (ed.), The United States’ Defend Forward Cyber Strategy: A Comprehensive Legal Assessment (2022) 236, at 237 (‘the precise threshold or degree of harm required to establish a breach remains unsettled’).\n59 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 7 (Australia); 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added) (describing a norm requiring states to act ‘if a State is aware of or is notified in good faith that an internationally wrongful act conducted using ICTs is emanating from or transiting through its territory’); Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 34.\n60 E.g. UN Human Rights Council, The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age, UN Doc. A/HRC/Res/42/15, 7 October 2019, para. 4.\n61 See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 182–186.\n62 Deeks, supra note 17, at 308; see also International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966, 999 UNTS 171.\n63 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 185; cf. ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, at 4 (‘[t]he circumstances in which states exercise jurisdiction, through cyber means, over individuals outside their territory is currently unsettled’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273\nEven assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect,⁶⁴ and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation.⁶⁵ Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n# 4 Conclusion\nThe SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace.⁶⁶ Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles\n⁶⁴ See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n⁶⁵ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 13, Norm 13(g); see also *ibid.* at 13 (noting that each state determines 'the structural, technical, organizational, legislative and regulatory measures necessary to protect their critical infrastructure').\n⁶⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve⁶⁷ and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do.\n67 Coco, Dias and van Benthem, supra note 50."

Eichensehr* # Abstract In 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n# 1 Introduction The cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency immediately issued an emergency directive instructing US government agencies to disconnect devices affected by the compromise and later provided guidance on reinstalling updated versions of SolarWinds Orion, along with other actions to harden systems against further intrusions.¹¹ On 15 April 2021, the USA attributed ‘the broad-scope cyber espionage campaign that exploited the SolarWinds Orion platform and other information technology infrastructures’ to Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR in Russian) and imposed sanctions on Russia’s intelligence services, including the SVR, as well as certain Russian companies that support those intelligence services.¹² In explaining the sanctions, the White House highlighted the wide scope of the intrusion, which gave the SVR ‘the ability to spy on or potentially disrupt more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide’, and the ‘undue burden on the mostly private sector victims who must bear the unusually high cost of mitigating this incident’.¹³ Pointing to ‘Russia’s history of... reckless and disruptive cyber operations’, the US Treasury Department emphasized that ‘[t]he SVR has put at risk the global technology supply chain’ and caused victims to spend ‘millions of dollars’ in remediation.¹⁴ However, the USA did not call the hack a violation of international law.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not.¹⁶ Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations As far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'.¹⁷ At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted.¹⁸ This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence.

Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case,¹⁹ states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force.²⁰ The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'.²¹ The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.²² # B Prohibition on Intervention Cyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention.²³ The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not.²⁴ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs ¹⁹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

But see D.B. Hollis and T. van Bentham, 'What Would Happen If States Started Looking at Cyber Operations as a\"Threat\"to Use Force?', Lawfare (30 March 2021), available at www.lawfareblog.com/ what-would-happen-if-states-started-looking-cyber-operations-threat-use-force.\n²³ Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n²⁴ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 57 (Netherlands) ('[t]he precise definition of coercion, and thus of unauthorised intervention, has not yet fully crystallised in international law'); ibid., at 116 (United Kingdom) (describing 'the precise boundaries of' the prohibition on intervention as 'the subject of on-going debate'); 'International Law Applicable in Cyberspace', Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 25 ('further State practice and opinio juris will help clarify the thresholds for the rule of non-intervention, and the scope of customary law in this area over time').\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal without outside interference'.²⁵ Intervention has two elements: (i) it must ‘bear[] on matters in which each State is permitted... to decide freely’, including ‘the choice of a political, economic, social and cultural system, and the formulation of foreign policy’, and (ii) it must involve ‘coercion in regard to such choices, which must remain free ones’.²⁶ The first element is often described as involving a state’s domaine réservé,²⁷ and it is somewhat clearer than the second element – coercion – which ‘is not defined in international law’.²⁸ Although the SolarWinds incident arguably interfered with the US domaine réservé, given the compromises of numerous US government departments, it did not coerce the USA and thus does not constitute intervention. The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs.²⁹ Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention.³⁰ Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action.³¹ The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’.³² Other frequent examples include interfering with the Not Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269 operations of a state's legislature,³³ disrupting provision of health care³⁴ and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure.³⁵ All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n## C Violation of Sovereignty Whether cyber operations below the use of force threshold and outside of prohibited intervention violate international law has become a hotly contested issue. In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act.³⁶ A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty.³⁷ On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.³⁸ The US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position.³⁹ In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’.⁴⁰ Given divergences among states about the existence State Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n³³ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n³⁴ Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n³⁵ See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n³⁷ ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n³⁸ Rt. Hon. J. Wright, ‘Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century’, UK Government (23 May 2018), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century. The United Kingdom reaffirmed this position in May 2022. Braverman, supra note 31.\n³⁹ P.C. Ney Jr., ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at U.S. Cyber Command Legal Conference’, US Department of Defense (2 March 2020), available at www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2099378/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference/.\n⁴⁰ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 140 (USA).\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal of, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.⁴¹ Even assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’.⁴² With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty.⁴³ SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty.⁴⁴ Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.⁴⁵ Turning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’.⁴⁶ The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.⁴⁷ Concluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty.⁴⁸ Such views would make little sense if efforts like ⁴¹ ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n⁴³ Ibid., at 20–21.\n⁴⁴ Ibid., at 21.\n⁴⁵ ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n⁴⁶ Schmitt, supra note 6.\n⁴⁷ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴⁸ See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271 reinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.⁴⁹ ## D Due Diligence Some commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence.⁵⁰ Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁵¹ Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations.⁵² States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence,⁵³ but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding.⁵⁴ Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.⁵⁵ Even assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’.⁵⁶ In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing ⁴⁹ Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n⁵⁰ Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n⁵¹ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n⁵² See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n⁵³ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 10 (‘Norm 13(c) States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using [information and communications technologies]’).\n⁵⁴ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n⁵⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see EJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal strange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57 Moreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law In the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63 also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273 Even assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect,⁶⁴ and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation.⁶⁵ Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n# 4 Conclusion The SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace.⁶⁶ Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles ⁶⁴ See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n⁶⁵ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 13, Norm 13(g); see also *ibid.* at 13 (noting that each state determines 'the structural, technical, organizational, legislative and regulatory measures necessary to protect their critical infrastructure').\n⁶⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc. A/68/98*, 24 June 2013, para. 19.\n\nLegal/Illegal to play in this constitutional moment for the international law on cyber operations. Though we are not the lawmakers, scholars contribute to the project of establishing international law for cyberspace both by pointing towards how international law might evolve⁶⁷ and by clarifying areas that it does not yet cover, as this article attempts to accomplish. There is much left to do."

This article considers established and emerging legal rules and concludes, based on the publicly available facts, that SolarWinds likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands.⁶ The article closes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in the ongoing debates about the scope of international law governing cyber operations.\n\n---\n\n## # 3 Possible Legal Violations As far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'.¹⁷ At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted.¹⁸ This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence. It concludes with a brief word about international human rights law.\n\nby the High Representative on Behalf of the European Union Expressing Solidarity with the United States on the Impact of the SolarWinds Cyber Operation', Council of the European Union (15 April 2021), available at www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/04/15/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-expressing-solidarity-with-the-united-states-on-the-impact-of-the-solarwinds-cyber-operation; 'North Atlantic Council Statement Following the Announcement by the United States of Actions with Regard to Russia', North Atlantic Treaty Organization (15 April 2021), available at www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_183168.htm; 'Russia: UK and US Expose Global Campaign of Malign Activity by Russian Intelligence Services', UK Government (15 April 2021), available at www.gov.uk/government/news/russia-uk-and-us-expose-global-campaigns-of-malign-activity-by-russian-intelligence-services.\n¹⁶ See Eichensehr, 'Defend Forward and Attribution', in J.

Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case,¹⁹ states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force.²⁰ The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'.²¹ The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.²² # B Prohibition on Intervention Cyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention.²³ The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not.²⁴ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs ¹⁹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs.²⁹ Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention.³⁰ Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action.³¹ The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’.³² Other frequent examples include interfering with the Not Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1269 operations of a state's legislature,³³ disrupting provision of health care³⁴ and significantly disrupting a state's financial system or other critical infrastructure.³⁵ All of these examples involve disruptions with more significant direct consequences for governments or individuals than the compromise of information involved in SolarWinds.\n³³ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n³⁴ Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n³⁵ See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n³⁷ ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n³⁸ Rt. Hon. J. Wright, ‘Cyber and International Law in the 21st Century’, UK Government (23 May 2018), available at www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cyber-and-international-law-in-the-21st-century. The United Kingdom reaffirmed this position in May 2022. Braverman, supra note 31.\n³⁹ P.C. Ney Jr., ‘DOD General Counsel Remarks at U.S. Cyber Command Legal Conference’, US Department of Defense (2 March 2020), available at www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/2099378/dod-general-counsel-remarks-at-us-cyber-command-legal-conference/.\n⁴⁰ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 140 (USA).\nEJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal of, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.⁴¹ Even assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’.⁴² With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty.⁴³ SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty.⁴⁴ Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.⁴⁵ Turning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’.⁴⁶ The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.⁴⁷ Concluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty.⁴⁸ Such views would make little sense if efforts like ⁴¹ ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴² Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n⁴³ Ibid., at 20–21.\n⁴⁴ Ibid., at 21.\n⁴⁵ ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n⁴⁶ Schmitt, supra note 6.\n⁴⁷ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n⁴⁸ See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271 reinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.⁴⁹ ## D Due Diligence Some commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence.⁵⁰ Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁵¹ Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations.⁵² States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence,⁵³ but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding.⁵⁴ Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.⁵⁵ Even assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’.⁵⁶ In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing ⁴⁹ Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n⁵⁰ Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n⁵¹ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n⁵² See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n⁵³ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 10 (‘Norm 13(c) States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using [information and communications technologies]’).\n⁵⁴ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n⁵⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see EJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274 Legal/Illegal strange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57 Moreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n## E International Human Rights Law In the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63 also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\nNot Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273 Even assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect,⁶⁴ and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation.⁶⁵ Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.",

In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\nextra_sections:None\npayload_tokens_before:7875\npayload_tokens_after:6099\ndropped_section:# 2 The SolarWinds Incident and States' Responses The SolarWinds incident began with a supply chain hack: Russian government hackers compromised the update process for SolarWinds’ Orion network-monitoring software and caused 18,000 of the company’s customers to download an update containing malicious code.⁷ The hackers then selected a smaller number of the breached entities for additional targeting,⁸ using their initial access via Orion to reach the ² See, e.g., E.

Eichensehr*\n\n# Abstract\n\nIn 2021, the USA and other governments formally blamed Russia for a wide-ranging hacking campaign that breached the update process for SolarWinds Orion network monitoring software and used that access to compromise numerous government agencies, companies and other entities. Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.\n\n# 1 Introduction\n\nThe cyber-security incident known as SolarWinds first came to light on 8 December 2020 when cyber-security firm FireEye announced that it had been breached by a 'highly sophisticated state-sponsored attacker utilizing novel techniques'.

A state that suffers an internationally wrongful act has no obligation to acknowledge that the act occurred or to identify the act as legally wrongful unless it intends to take countermeasures in response, which the USA did not.¹⁶ Nonetheless, the fact that none of the states that condemned Russia's behaviour did so as a legal matter is probative because state practice and opinio juris determine the customary international law that governs state behaviour. In analysing whether Russia's SolarWinds intrusion violated international law, the next section therefore relies heavily on states' publicly proffered legal views.\n\n# 3 Possible Legal Violations\n\nAs far as is publicly known, the SolarWinds intrusion involved a supply chain compromise by Russia to install malicious software into US government and other critical infrastructure entities for the purpose of espionage. Law and espionage have a complicated relationship. Although states criminalize spying in their domestic laws, international law is silent on espionage as such, and states have a long-standing practice of spying on one another. The common understanding is that 'international law either fails to regulate spying or affirmatively permits it'.¹⁷ At the same time, deeming an operation espionage is not a carte blanche. A cyber operation intended to facilitate espionage could still violate international law depending on how it is conducted.¹⁸ This section considers whether the SolarWinds incident violated international law prohibitions on the use of force and intervention or emergent rules on sovereignty and due diligence.

Building on the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) analysis in the Nicaragua case,¹⁹ states are coalescing around the position that a cyber operation that is similar in 'scale and effects' to a non-cyber use of force will be considered a use of force.²⁰ The USA has explained that, '[i]f the physical consequences of a cyber activity result in the kind of damage that dropping a bomb or firing a missile would, that cyber activity should equally be considered a use of force/armed attack'.²¹ The SolarWinds incident does not meet this threshold: it did not cause death, injury, destruction or even the sort of very significant non-physical disruption that some states might consider to meet the scale and effects test.²²\n\n# B Prohibition on Intervention\n\nCyber operations that do not constitute uses of force might nonetheless run afoul of the customary international law prohibition on intervention.²³ The existence of the prohibition on intervention is well settled, but its scope with respect to cyber operations is not.²⁴ In the Nicaragua case, the ICJ explained that '[t]he principle of non-intervention involves the right of every sovereign State to conduct its affairs\n\n¹⁹ Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

The Tallinn Manual explains that coercion generally ‘refers to an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, that is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain from acting in a particular way’ with respect to its internal or external affairs.²⁹ Upon discovering the intrusion, the USA cut off Russia’s access to compromised systems by disconnecting devices using the SolarWinds software and directing the updating and reinstallation of the software, and it subsequently invested in cybersecurity upgrades. But basic responses to the discovery of espionage and attempts to prevent its recurrence do not equate to a denial of freedom of choice.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence that Russia intended to coerce the USA, as many believe is required for intervention.³⁰ Simply put, spying on a state to discern what actions it is likely to take is not the same as coercing it to take, or to refrain from, any particular action.³¹ The US efforts to stop the espionage and harden systems against recurrence suggest either a lack of intended coercion or that whatever coercion might have been intended failed spectacularly, resulting in improved defences that were counterproductive to Russia’s espionage aims.\n\nSolarWinds is also unlike examples that states have given of prohibited interventions. Prominent among such examples is cyber operations ‘to prevent another State from holding an election, or manipulate the electoral system to alter the results of an election in another State’.³² Other frequent examples include interfering with the\n\n25 Nicaragua, supra note 19, para. 202.\n26 Ibid., para. 205.\n27 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 34 (Germany).\n28 Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 317.\n29 Ibid.\n30 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 34 (Germany); ibid., at 57 (Netherlands); Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 317, 321.\n31 See, e.g., Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 323 (‘[c]yber espionage per se, as distinct from the underlying acts that enable the espionage... does not qualify as intervention because it lacks a coercive element’); Rt.

In 2017, the Tallinn Manual 2.0 controversially took the position that sovereignty is a standalone rule of international law, such that violations of a state's sovereignty constitute an internationally wrongful act.³⁶ A number of states have subsequently endorsed this view, though often with the caveat that only operations above a certain threshold constitute violations. For example, Germany specified that ‘negligible physical effects and functional impairments below a certain impact threshold’ do not violate sovereignty.³⁷ On the other side of the spectrum, the UK has rejected the existence of a standalone rule of sovereignty, framing sovereignty as a principle of international law that informs other rules like non-intervention, but denying that states ‘can currently extrapolate from that general principle a specific rule or additional prohibition for cyber activity beyond that of a prohibited intervention’.³⁸\n\nThe US position on the question has been ambiguous. A 2020 speech by the US Defense Department’s General Counsel suggested that the US view ‘shares similarities with’ the UK position.³⁹ In a 2021 filing with the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), however, the USA explained that ‘one State’s non-consensual cyber operation in another State’s territory, even if it falls below the threshold of a use of force or non-intervention, could also violate international law’, but does ‘not constitute a per se violation of international law’, a distinction that ‘is perhaps most clear where such activities in another State’s territory have no effects or de minimis effects’.⁴⁰ Given divergences among states about the existence\n\nState Activity in Cyberspace’, New Zealand Government (1 December 2022), para. 10, available at https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-12/The%20Application%20of%20International%20Law%20to%20State%20Activity%20in%20Cyberspace.pdf.\n\n³³ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 5 (Australia).\n³⁴ Ibid., at 116-17 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 140 (USA).\n³⁵ See, e.g., ibid., at 5 (Australia); ibid., at 69 (Norway); ibid., at 116–117 (United Kingdom); ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 24; ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 10.\n³⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 17–27.\n³⁷ ‘Position Paper’, Germany Federal Government, supra note 20, at 4 (emphasis omitted).\n³⁸ Rt.

    "EJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\n\nLegal/Illegal\n\nof, and threshold for, a rule of sovereignty, even states that endorse the rule have acknowledged that ‘further state practice is required for the precise boundaries of [sovereignty’s] application to crystallise’.⁴¹\n\nEven assuming that sovereignty is a rule, it does not appear that the SolarWinds incident violated it. The Tallinn Manual suggests that a sovereignty violation can occur via a breach of a state’s territorial integrity or an ‘interference with or usurpation of inherently governmental functions’.⁴² With respect to territorial integrity, the Tallinn Manual’s experts agreed that cyber operations causing physical damage or injury or a loss of functionality necessitating ‘repair or replacement of physical components of cyber infrastructure’ would violate sovereignty.⁴³ SolarWinds did neither of these things and instead required the reinstallation of updated software. Only some Tallinn Manual drafters thought that a loss of functionality requiring software reinstallation would violate sovereignty, and the manual warns that additional state practice is needed to clarify when a loss of functionality violates sovereignty.⁴⁴ Notably, at least one sovereignty-as-a-rule state has said that ‘cyber activity that requires rebooting or the reinstallation of an operating system is likely not a violation of territorial sovereignty’.⁴⁵\n\nTurning to the second proposed basis, SolarWinds targeted inherently governmental functions, but whether it interfered with or usurped them is a separate question. Michael Schmitt, the Tallinn Manual’s editor and a leading proponent of the sovereignty-as-a-rule position, answered the question in the negative, arguing that ‘the mere fact of espionage has never been characterized as interference, at least not as that concept is understood with respect to sovereignty violation’.⁴⁶ The confidentiality breaches caused by SolarWinds are a far cry from examples that states have given of interference with government functions, examples like ‘altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities’.⁴⁷\n\nConcluding that SolarWinds violated international law because it violated US sovereignty would require adopting not just the contested sovereignty-as-a-rule view but also a broad understanding of that position, which is not supported by state practice and opinio juris. The sovereignty violation question must also be considered in conjunction with some sovereignty-as-a-rule states’ explicit view that cyber espionage does not violate sovereignty.⁴⁸ Such views would make little sense if efforts like\n\n⁴¹ ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 12; see also GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n\n⁴² Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 20.\n\n⁴³ Ibid., at 20–21.\n\n⁴⁴ Ibid., at 21.\n\n⁴⁵ ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17.\n\n⁴⁶ Schmitt, supra note 6.\n\n⁴⁷ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 68 (Norway).\n\n⁴⁸ See, e.g., ‘International Law Applicable in Cyberspace’, Government of Canada, supra note 20, para. 17 (‘some cyber activities, such as cyber espionage, do not amount to a breach of territorial sovereignty, and hence to a violation of international law’).",
    "Not Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1271\n\nreinstalling software to block ongoing espionage transformed cyber espionage into a sovereignty violation.⁴⁹\n\n## D Due Diligence\n\nSome commentators have suggested that Russia’s failure to prevent the SolarWinds incident might have violated an international law requirement of due diligence.⁵⁰ Due diligence is a long-standing concept in international law that requires a state to act to prevent or remedy transboundary harm emanating from its territory. In the Corfu Channel case, the ICJ identified ‘every State’s obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States’.⁵¹ Despite the due diligence principle’s long pedigree, there are legal and factual difficulties with applying it to SolarWinds. Most fundamentally, states hold divergent views about whether or how due diligence applies to cyber operations.⁵² States in the GGE have endorsed a norm of due diligence,⁵³ but prominent states including the UK and the USA have denied that it is legally binding.⁵⁴ Even states that endorse a legal rule of due diligence applied to cyber operations recognize that there is disagreement about its application.⁵⁵\n\nEven assuming the existence of a customary international law rule – a highly contested assumption – SolarWinds likely does not violate Russia’s due diligence obligations for several reasons. Due diligence is framed as the responsibility of a territorial state to prevent another state or non-state actor from using its territory to cause harm to a victim state. As the Tallinn Manual explains, the due diligence rule ‘assumes the involvement of at least three parties: (1) the target State of the cyber operation; (2) the territorial State that is the subject of the Rule, and (3) a third party that is the author of the cyber operation’.⁵⁶ In SolarWinds, however, there was no third party; the perpetrator was the Russian government. It is passing\n\n⁴⁹ Cf. Schmitt, supra note 6 (‘[f]inding a sovereignty breach on the basis that if the espionage is discovered, the victim state would decide to replace the affected infrastructure would be quite a stretch even for those who support sovereignty as a rule’).\n\n⁵⁰ Coco, Dias and van Benthem, ‘Illegal: The SolarWinds Hack under International Law’, 33 European Journal of International Law (2022) 1275.\n\n⁵¹ The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania), Judgment, 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports (1949) 4, at 22.\n\n⁵² See, e.g., D.B. Hollis, Improving Transparency: International Law and State Cyber Operations: Fourth Report, Doc. CJI/doc.603/20rev.1corr.1, in Organization of American States, Annual Report of the Inter-American Juridical Committee to the General Assembly (2020) 120, para. 57 (‘there are competing views on whether due diligence is a requirement of international law in cyberspace’).\n\n⁵³ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 10 (‘Norm 13(c) States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using [information and communications technologies]’).\n\n⁵⁴ GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 117 (United Kingdom); ibid., at 141 (USA); see also ‘Application of International Law’, New Zealand Government, supra note 32, para. 17.\n\n⁵⁵ See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 48 (Japan); ibid., at 58 (Netherlands).\n\n⁵⁶ Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 32. The GGE report’s description of a due diligence norm similarly suggests that ‘a State should not permit another State or non-State actor to use ICTs within its territory to commit internationally wrongful acts’. 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added); see",
    "EJIL 33 (2022), 1263-1274\n\nLegal/Illegal\n\nstrange to say that Russia violated its due diligence obligation by failing to stop its own conduct.57\n\nMoreover, due diligence obligations are triggered when cyber operations cause some amount of harm contrary to the rights of the targeted state.58 States and commentators have interpreted this element to require that the victim state suffer an internationally wrongful act or what would be an internationally wrongful act if done by a state.59 Finding a violation of due diligence therefore depends on identifying some other violation of international law – a criterion not clearly met for SolarWinds.\n\n## E International Human Rights Law\n\nIn the past decade, states have recognized that international human rights law applies to cyber activities and, in particular, that ‘the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy’.60 As a matter of both customary and treaty law, however, there are jurisdictional limits on states’ human rights obligations that become important in the context of cross-border cyber operations.61 For example, even those who endorse a broad understanding of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ‘concede that a state party has obligations only to those individuals in territory under that state’s “effective control” (the spatial model of jurisdiction) or who are subject to that state’s legal jurisdiction (the personal model of jurisdiction)’.62 Similarly, the majority of the Tallinn Manual drafters concluded that ‘physical control over territory or the individual is required before human rights law obligations are triggered’ and that ‘the premise of exercising power or effective control by virtual means such that human rights obligations attach runs contrary to both extensive State practice and the paucity of expressions of opinio juris thereon’.63\n\nalso GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 76 (Romania) (noting that due diligence involves acts by ‘a non-State actor or a third State... from or through the territory of the potentially responsible State’).\n\n57 Due diligence fits more naturally in the context of criminal ransomware emanating from Russia. See Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, ‘The Oxford Statement on International Law Protections in Cyberspace: The Regulation of Ransomware Operations’, para. 4, available at www.elac.ox.ac.uk/the-oxford-process/the-statements-overview/the-oxford-statement-on-ransomware-operations/.\n\n58 See Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 34; but see ibid., at 36 (‘[t]he precise threshold of harm at which the due diligence principle applies is unsettled in international law’); Jensen and Watts, ‘Due Diligence and Defend Forward’, in J. Goldsmith (ed.), The United States’ Defend Forward Cyber Strategy: A Comprehensive Legal Assessment (2022) 236, at 237 (‘the precise threshold or degree of harm required to establish a breach remains unsettled’).\n\n59 See, e.g., GGE Compendium, supra note 21, at 7 (Australia); 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, para. 29 (emphasis added) (describing a norm requiring states to act ‘if a State is aware of or is notified in good faith that an internationally wrongful act conducted using ICTs is emanating from or transiting through its territory’); Tallinn Manual 2.0, supra note 17, at 34.\n\n60 E.g.

    "Not Illegal: The SolarWinds Incident and International Law 1273\n\nEven assuming that the SolarWinds incident infringed victims' privacy or other rights, the jurisdictional limitations on international human rights law render it unlikely that Russia was obliged to respect the rights of the victims affected by the compromise. There is a separate question about whether states in which victims were located, particularly the USA, failed in an obligation to protect the human rights of victims in their territory. Nonetheless, even as to that question, states disagree in general about the scope of a state's duty to protect,⁶⁴ and what such a duty would require with respect to defending against foreign cyber espionage is unclear, particularly given divergences in states' domestic approaches to cyber-security regulation. The 2021 GGE report included a norm that 'States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from' cyber threats, but it stopped short of mandating such measures and left room for wide variation.⁶⁵ Cyber operations can certainly violate international human rights law, but it is far from clear that SolarWinds did so.\n\n# 4 Conclusion\n\nThe SolarWinds incident was disruptive and costly for the victims, both in terms of remediation costs and the harder-to-quantify harms from stolen information. In some ways, it is deeply unsatisfying to conclude that international law does not clearly prohibit and may even permit such operations. At the same time, it is important to be clear about why that is the case. Cyber operations are putting pressure on international law, revealing the gaps that exist and that states may choose to fill with new rules, like a violation of sovereignty, or broader interpretations of existing rules, like the prohibition on intervention. But states may also choose not to close all of the gaps. Just as international law has long tolerated espionage, states may similarly leave cyber espionage and other operations below the use-of-force level at least partly unregulated, prioritizing flexibility over tamping down such behaviours. The state practice and *opinio juris* elements ensure that the establishment of customary international law remains the prerogative of states.\n\nThe legal debates about international law and cyberspace have come a long way in the decade since the 2013 GGE report cryptically confirmed that international law applies to cyberspace.⁶⁶ Increasing numbers of states are providing thoughtful and detailed positions about cyber and international law in venues like the GGE and the Organization of American States and in speeches and position papers. As the sophistication of discussions increases, scholars and other commentators also have roles\n\n⁶⁴ See *Tallinn Manual 2.0*, supra note 17, at 197, n. 433 (noting that states, including the USA and the United Kingdom, 'hold the position that the obligation to protect is limited and cannot be characterized as a general obligation of customary international human rights law').\n\n⁶⁵ 2021 GGE Report, supra note 18, at 13, Norm 13(g); see also *ibid.* at 13 (noting that each state determines 'the structural, technical, organizational, legislative and regulatory measures necessary to protect their critical infrastructure').\n\n⁶⁶ Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, UN Doc.

Despite denouncing Russia's cyber espionage and imposing sanctions, the USA did not call Russia's actions illegal as a matter of international law – and for good reason. Based on the publicly available facts, this article argues that the SolarWinds incident likely did not run afoul of international law as it currently stands. The article considers the prohibitions on the use of force and intervention, emerging rules with respect to violations of sovereignty and due diligence, and international human rights law, and it concludes with some reflections on the role of states and scholars in decisions about whether to close gaps in international law.",
