Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.\n\nKeywords: state responsibility, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyber attack, Russia, hacktivism, Nashi, Russian Business Network, effective control, adoption of act, government authority, Estonia, Georgia, DDoS",

The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time.¹ The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost.² Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations.³ This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing \"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes.⁴ Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary.⁵ These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid.⁶ By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law.⁷ The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\n\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space.⁸ It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society.⁹ Cyber attacks are\n\n¹ Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82\n² ibid, p. 84\n³ McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60\n⁴ Blank, p. 82-83\n⁵ Blank, p. 93\n⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4\n⁷ Blank, p. 83\n⁸ Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1\n⁹ ibid p. 2",

From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained.¹⁶ The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible.¹⁷ Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state.¹⁸ The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks.¹⁹ It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\n\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws.²⁰ The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion.²¹ The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’*²² and *‘The Wild West’*²³, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner\n\n¹⁰ Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817\n¹¹ Efrony, p. 2\n¹² Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817\n¹³ Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\" a=\"\" were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’\n¹⁴ Efrony, p. 2\n¹⁵ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n¹⁶ ibid\n¹⁷ Efrony, p. 2\n¹⁸ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854\n¹⁹ Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428\n²⁰ Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1\n²¹ Efrony, p. 2\n²² Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234\n²³ Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384\n5</https:>",

Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity.²⁷ The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures.²⁸ Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’.²⁹ It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.³⁰\n\nThe legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt.³¹ The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested.³² However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address.³³ Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited.³⁴ The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of\n\n²⁴ Roscini, p 234\n²⁵ Tran, p 384\n²⁶ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2\n²⁷ Efrony, p. 2-3\n²⁸ Shany and Schmitt, p. 2\n²⁹ Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4\n³⁰ Tran, p. 382\n³¹ ibid, p. 387\n³² ibid, p. 388\n³³ ibid, p. 389\n³⁴ ibid, p. 390",

The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.³⁵\n\n## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation\n\nIn 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences.³⁶ This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles).³⁷ The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question.³⁸ This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\n\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law.³⁹ The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation.⁴⁰ The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states,⁴¹ as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.⁴²\n\nThe second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.⁴³\n\n³⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10\n³⁶ France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n³⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1\n³⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10\n³⁹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842\n⁴⁰ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7\n⁴¹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n⁴² ibid, p. 841\n⁴³ UN Charter, art. 2(4)",

Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\n\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate:\n\n## Article 4.

The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity.⁵³ Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would \"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests.⁵⁴ The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.⁵⁵\n\nThe targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties.⁵⁶ The\n\n⁴⁹ DARSIWA, p. 26\n⁵⁰ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9\n⁵¹ ibid, p. 10\n⁵² ibid, p. 10-11\n⁵³ Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50\n⁵⁴ Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36\n⁵⁵ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11\n⁵⁶ ibid, p. 10",

The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62\n\nThere were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68\n\nRussia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread.

I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\n\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person \"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\" is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are\n\n70 Heickerö R, FOI., p. 42\n71 Tikk E, Vihul L, Kaska K, International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations, (2010), p. 23\n72 Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 41\n73 ibid, p. 40\n74 \"Commissar\" was the formal title for head of a government department in the Soviet Union, Cambridge Dictionary, <https: dictionary=\"\" dictionary.cambridge.org=\"\" english=\"\" commissar=\"\"> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n75 Shahtman N, <https: 03=\"\" 2009=\"\" pro-kremlin-gro=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n76 Lowe C, <https: article=\"\" us-russia-estonia-cyberspace-idustre52b4d820090313=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n77 Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed' 25 December 2020'\n78 Arnold C, <https: 1564694.html=\"\" a=\"\" duma=\"\" duma.gov.ru=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" gov.=\"\" gova=\"\" n=\"\" numa=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed 26 December 2020'\n79 Russian Government, <http: about=\"\" duma=\"\" duma.gov.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 26 December 2020'\n80 DARSIWA, Article 4, Commentary para. 3, p. 40\n\n11</https:></https:></https:></https:>",

The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\n\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87\n\ni. whether the non-state entity was created by the state\nii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance\niii. whether complete control was exercised in fact\niv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group\n\nThe first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n\n81 Salvador Commercial Company, UNRIAA, vol.

The result of which could be permissible attribution under article 5. Launching attacks are generally considered to be a matter of the State's military department, and as cyber are considered to constitute an attack just as much as those of kinetics this may be assumed to apply.⁹⁰ The analysis may also rely on the cultural dependent-aspect of determining what constitute elements of governmental authority, which is fortunate in the particular case of Russia.⁹¹ The nature of Russian warfare has a prominent core of psychological and information operations, which encompasses even their theoretical conception of warfare and international relations.⁹² Cyber attacks have become a new means through which they may conduct these operations, and it has been evident in the cyber attacks against Estonia. Based on this, the group may be considered to have exercised elements of governmental authority. One additional criteria for the invocation of article 5 states that the group must also be 'empowered by the law of that State' to exercise such functions. This requires a statute or contractual agreement.⁹³ This has not been found in the relationship between Nashi and the Russian Federation. Conclusively, it is evident that the relationship is not contractual, but rather built on financing and inter-personal relations such as visits and speech-givings.⁹⁴ Russia may therefore not be held responsible for these cyber attacks on Estonia on basis of article 5 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf.⁹⁵ Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.⁹⁶\n\nBeginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'.⁹⁷ A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware.⁹⁸ The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites⁹⁹, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an\n\n⁹⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106\n⁹¹ DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43\n⁹² Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n⁹³ DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6)\n⁹⁴ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38\n⁹⁵ DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8\n⁹⁶ DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48\n⁹⁷ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11\n⁹⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n⁹⁹ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020'\n\n13",

Whether it would be a private person solely, a private person under the subordination of the state or a state organ itself would remarkably alter the outcome of the analysis. Were the scenario of a private person initiating the attacks and disseminating the instructions in the Russian-speaking forums the issue would have needed to be handled through domestic criminal law, as no state could be hold responsible for that private act as a general principle.¹⁰⁰ If the instructions originated from a state organ the criteria for attribution would have been reached under this article, even if the conduct had not been authorised by the machinery of the state itself. Conduct contrary to official mandates or instructions are still considered as the acts of a state organ, constituting ultra vires, presumably they acted in their official capacity.¹⁰¹ However, if the instructions were given by a private person subordinate to the state, but not a state organ, and the individual acted outside the given scope of mandate the conduct may not be construed back to the state as ultra vires in this context would violate the general principle that the conduct of private persons do not invoke the responsibility of states.¹⁰²\n\nContinuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state.¹⁰³ These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁴ So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁵ The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls'¹⁰⁶, and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'.¹⁰⁷ The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets.

Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control.¹¹¹ The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.¹¹²\n\nThe control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity.¹¹³ The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching.¹¹⁴ The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of.¹¹⁵ Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves.¹¹⁶ This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\n\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control.¹¹⁷ Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons.

What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state¹¹⁹, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.¹²⁰\n\nThe International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.¹²¹\n\nThe elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it.¹²² The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'.¹²³ The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'.¹²⁴ Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process.¹²⁵ The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity.¹²⁶ Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events \"will happen more and more\".¹²⁷ It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here.¹²⁸ Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own.

The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”¹³⁰, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’.¹³¹ He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\n\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously.¹³² This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB.¹³³ While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.¹³⁴\n\n¹²⁹ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n¹³⁰ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n¹³¹ Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹³² Tikk, p. 27\n¹³³ Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n¹³⁴ Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n17",

A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead.¹³⁶ Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region.

The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.¹⁵⁰\n\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials.¹⁵¹ xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began¹⁵², and was kept updated continuously.¹⁵³ stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character.¹⁵⁴ It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses¹⁵⁵, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse.¹⁵⁶ The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.¹⁵⁷\n\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source.¹⁵⁸ Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence.¹⁵⁹ Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial.¹⁶⁰ Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.¹⁶¹\n\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network.

To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers.¹⁷¹ Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name.¹⁷² Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace.¹⁷³ As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state¹⁷⁴, and in some instances so do the RBN.¹⁷⁵ Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution.

Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law.¹⁷⁹ As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\n\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities.¹⁸⁰ One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial.¹⁸¹ While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\n\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison.¹⁸² This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors¹⁸³, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\n\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus.¹⁸⁴ When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as\n\n¹⁷⁷ ibid, p. 8\n¹⁷⁸ DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26\n¹⁷⁹ Macak, p. 10\n¹⁸⁰ ibid, p. 15\n¹⁸¹ Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50\n¹⁸² Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n¹⁸³ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁸⁴ Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\" en=\"\" government=\"\" government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021'\n\n21",

The criteria of the instructions not needing to be detailed, but must be in regards to a particular event and clarify the organisational relationship between the two actors.¹⁸⁵ This is beyond any doubt applicable to such a scenario. One might even argue that the state exercises effective control over the individuals, as they would not be able to continue their cyber activities if not for the state’s involvement holding off the punishment of emprisonment. Depending on the circumstances, the state would have the possibility to be involved and oversee specific operations. This is applicable regardless of whether the individual is acting solo, or as part of the the Nashi group or the Russian Business Network. Since the relationship between Nashi and Russia have already been described in the Estonian case that conclusion will be applied here, and following section will focus on whether Russia can be said to exercise effective control over the RBN and the individual ‘patriotic’ hackers.\n\nAs mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law.¹⁸⁶ This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.¹⁸⁷\n\nThe hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded.¹⁸⁸ By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\n\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere.

The Russian Business Networks gets their financing from the services they provide, which includes timely rented botnets.¹⁹² There are also unclarity in regards to whether the RBN have acted on the behalf of the state previously or not, which is important for the facts to be accurately interpreted. While some aspects are not recognised in this case, the higher criterium for effective control are nevertheless met.

Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired.¹⁹⁷ The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged.¹⁹⁸ Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components.¹⁹⁹ While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation.²⁰⁰ The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from.

If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity.²⁰² If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.²⁰³ If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.²⁰⁴\n\nEfforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’.²⁰⁵ While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.²⁰⁶ It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’.²⁰⁷ It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful.²⁰⁸ Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n\n²⁰¹ GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n²⁰² DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40\n²⁰³ DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26\n²⁰⁴ DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38\n²⁰⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n²⁰⁶ DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53\n²⁰⁷ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n²⁰⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11",

The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\n\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\n\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\n\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\n\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations.\n\n25",

Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.\nKeywords: state responsibility, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyber attack, Russia, hacktivism, Nashi, Russian Business Network, effective control, adoption of act, government authority, Estonia, Georgia, DDoS\n3\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction 4\nLegal Analysis - Breach of Obligation 7\nLegal Analysis - Attribution 8\nEstonia 2007 9\nGeorgia 2008 18\nConclusion 25\nBibliography 26\n# Introduction\nConceptions of warfare has evolved in different directions depending on cultures, time eras and advances in technology. The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time.¹ The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost.² Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations.³ This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing \"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes.⁴ Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary.⁵ These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid.⁶ By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law.⁷ The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space.⁸ It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society.⁹ Cyber attacks are\n¹ Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82\n² ibid, p. 84\n³ McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60\n⁴ Blank, p. 82-83\n⁵ Blank, p. 93\n⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4\n⁷ Blank, p. 83\n⁸ Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1\n⁹ ibid p. 2\nvalidly considered a national security issue, because of the malicious possibilities it gives to ill-minded individuals.¹⁰ The possible targets are limitless, and can include anything in between a nation’s economy¹¹ and it’s air defence systems and power grids.¹² Even enclosed networks used by military organisations have been targeted.¹³ The effects may destabilize societies, and even debilitate intangible norms and values such as democracy.¹⁴ Under these new circumstances it is the technology of which a state relies on that determines how secure that state is, making industrial states more vulnerable than others.¹⁵\nIt is not only the damaging effects that entices actors to employ cyber as a means of warfare. From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained.¹⁶ The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible.¹⁷ Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state.¹⁸ The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks.¹⁹ It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws.²⁰ The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion.²¹ The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’*²² and *‘The Wild West’*²³, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner\n¹⁰ Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817\n¹¹ Efrony, p. 2\n¹² Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817\n¹³ Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\" a=\"\" were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’\n¹⁴ Efrony, p. 2\n¹⁵ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n¹⁶ ibid\n¹⁷ Efrony, p. 2\n¹⁸ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854\n¹⁹ Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428\n²⁰ Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1\n²¹ Efrony, p. 2\n²² Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234\n²³ Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384\n5</https:>\nworkings of the cyber system.²⁴ These conceptions maintains the idea of the cyber domain being anarchic, leaving it open to escalation and an increase in severity with regards to cyber attacks of the future, and the ways in which they can be employed.²⁵ Consensus have although been reached in acknowledging that international law do apply, leaving the specifics to be a continued issue of debate.²⁶ The slow international progress on the topic is due to limited knowledge about the technical processes, but is also a result of politics. Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity.²⁷ The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures.²⁸ Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’.²⁹ It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.³⁰\nThe legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt.³¹ The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested.³² However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address.³³ Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited.³⁴ The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of\n²⁴ Roscini, p 234\n²⁵ Tran, p 384\n²⁶ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2\n²⁷ Efrony, p. 2-3\n²⁸ Shany and Schmitt, p. 2\n²⁹ Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4\n³⁰ Tran, p. 382\n³¹ ibid, p. 387\n³² ibid, p. 388\n³³ ibid, p. 389\n³⁴ ibid, p. 390\nService (DDoS) attacks. The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.³⁵\n## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation\nIn 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences.³⁶ This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles).³⁷ The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question.³⁸ This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law.³⁹ The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation.⁴⁰ The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states,⁴¹ as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.⁴²\nThe second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.⁴³\n³⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10\n³⁶ France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n³⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1\n³⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10\n³⁹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842\n⁴⁰ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7\n⁴¹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n⁴² ibid, p. 841\n⁴³ UN Charter, art. 2(4)\nDrawing on the advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case (1996), cyber attacks constitute a use of force as the article 2(4) was clarified by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to apply in relation to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons deployed'.44 Depending on it's scale and effect, a cyber attack might go beyond the use of force and reach the level of an armed attack, giving rise to the state's right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter.45 With the enlightenment of this premise, the thesis will move into the analysis of the cases under the Law on State Responsibility.\n## Legal Analysis - Attribution\nArticle 2 in the ILC's articles contains the elements of an internationally wrongful act. Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate:\n## Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n## Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n44 Kondoch B, *Jus ad Bellum and Cyber Warfare in Northeast Asia*, (2013), p. 468\n45 Schmitt M, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (2nd edn Cambridge University Press 2017), p. 54\n46 DARSIWA, Article 2, Commentaries, p. 34\n47 DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n48 DARSIWA, Article 4, Commentaries, p. 40\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n## Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n## Article 11. Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.⁴⁹\n## Estonia 2007\nDuring a period between April and May in 2007, Estonia was the target of multiple Distributed Denial of Service cyber attacks (DDoS).⁵⁰ A country which had heavily integrated information technology into the daily life of their citizens and even government, which worked basically 'paperless'.⁵¹ The attacks are believed to have been prompted by the Estonian decision to transfer a World War II statute from the centra of Tallinn to a more remote place outside the city.⁵² The statute commemorated the death of Soviet soldiers during the war, but constituted a painful reminder of soviet occupation for the Estonians. The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity.⁵³ Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would \"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests.⁵⁴ The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.⁵⁵\nThe targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties.⁵⁶ The\n⁴⁹ DARSIWA, p. 26\n⁵⁰ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9\n⁵¹ ibid, p. 10\n⁵² ibid, p. 10-11\n⁵³ Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50\n⁵⁴ Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36\n⁵⁵ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11\n⁵⁶ ibid, p. 10\nselection of targets appears to have been strategic, since the damaging effects of the attacks brought the services of the society to a halt. The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62\nThere were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68\nRussia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread. However, no conclusive evidence have insofar been unearthed to ascertain\n57 ibid p. 10-11\n58 Heickerö R, FOI, Emerging Cyber Threats and Russian Views on Information Warfare and Information Operations (2010), p. 40\n59 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n60 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 11\n61 Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n62 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n63 Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n64 ibid, p. 41\n65 Kash W, <https: 06=\"\" 13=\"\" 2008=\"\" articles=\"\" lauri-almann--lessons-from-the-cyberattacks-on-Estonia.aspx?page=\"1\" gcn.com=\"\"> 'accessed 3 December 2020'\n66 Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n67 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 11\n68 ibid, p. 10-11\n69 Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed' 25 December 2020'\n10</https:></https:>\ndirect state involvement.70 Instead, nationalistic hackers appear to have been the direct aggressor. Dmitri Galushkevich, an IT-student from Tallinn with Russian ethnicity, self-claimed responsibility through boasting about his capabilities for executing DDoS attacks against an Estonian political party's website, constituting part of the cyber attacks.71 He is the only individual until this day prosecuted for the unlawful cyber attacks.72\nAlbeit not having stood trial, the international attention has been placed on the russian Nashi Youth Group (наши, meaning 'Ours') due to implications of their involvement in the cyber attacks.73 Konstantin Goloskokov, one of the group's \"commissar\"74, actually admitted in 2009 to have been responsible for the cyber attacks along with some of his 'associates', insinuating the group being responsible for the events.73 Although, according to another interview of his, he claims the cyber attacks was his own initiative, executed without help from neither the Russian state or Nashi.76 The bewilderment continues to grow as Sergei Markov, member of the Russian Duma, acknowledged in a panel discussion that the attack was a \"reaction from civil society\" and at the same time \"was carried out by my assistant. I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person \"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\" is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are\n70 Heickerö R, FOI., p. 42\n71 Tikk E, Vihul L, Kaska K, International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations, (2010), p. 23\n72 Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 41\n73 ibid, p. 40\n74 \"Commissar\" was the formal title for head of a government department in the Soviet Union, Cambridge Dictionary, <https: dictionary=\"\" dictionary.cambridge.org=\"\" english=\"\" commissar=\"\"> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n75 Shahtman N, <https: 03=\"\" 2009=\"\" pro-kremlin-gro=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n76 Lowe C, <https: article=\"\" us-russia-estonia-cyberspace-idustre52b4d820090313=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n77 Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed' 25 December 2020'\n78 Arnold C, <https: 1564694.html=\"\" a=\"\" duma=\"\" duma.gov.ru=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" gov.=\"\" gova=\"\" n=\"\" numa=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed 26 December 2020'\n79 Russian Government, <http: about=\"\" duma=\"\" duma.gov.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 26 December 2020'\n80 DARSIWA, Article 4, Commentary para. 3, p. 40\n11</https:></https:></https:></https:>\ndone in their official capacity'.81 Whether Goloskokov acted in his official capacity can from the evidence gathered not be determined as the information is insufficient in shining a light on this aspect. The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87\ni. whether the non-state entity was created by the state\nii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance\niii. whether complete control was exercised in fact\niv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group\nThe first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n81 Salvador Commercial Company, UNRIAA, vol.

The result of which could be permissible attribution under article 5. Launching attacks are generally considered to be a matter of the State's military department, and as cyber are considered to constitute an attack just as much as those of kinetics this may be assumed to apply.⁹⁰ The analysis may also rely on the cultural dependent-aspect of determining what constitute elements of governmental authority, which is fortunate in the particular case of Russia.⁹¹ The nature of Russian warfare has a prominent core of psychological and information operations, which encompasses even their theoretical conception of warfare and international relations.⁹² Cyber attacks have become a new means through which they may conduct these operations, and it has been evident in the cyber attacks against Estonia. Based on this, the group may be considered to have exercised elements of governmental authority. One additional criteria for the invocation of article 5 states that the group must also be 'empowered by the law of that State' to exercise such functions. This requires a statute or contractual agreement.⁹³ This has not been found in the relationship between Nashi and the Russian Federation. Conclusively, it is evident that the relationship is not contractual, but rather built on financing and inter-personal relations such as visits and speech-givings.⁹⁴ Russia may therefore not be held responsible for these cyber attacks on Estonia on basis of article 5 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf.⁹⁵ Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.⁹⁶\nBeginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'.⁹⁷ A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware.⁹⁸ The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites⁹⁹, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an\n⁹⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106\n⁹¹ DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43\n⁹² Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n⁹³ DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6)\n⁹⁴ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38\n⁹⁵ DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8\n⁹⁶ DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48\n⁹⁷ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11\n⁹⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n⁹⁹ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020'\n13\nunlawful act. Despite this, it is not enough for assuming Russian responsibility, as there is unclarity in regards to who actually posted these instructions. Whether it would be a private person solely, a private person under the subordination of the state or a state organ itself would remarkably alter the outcome of the analysis. Were the scenario of a private person initiating the attacks and disseminating the instructions in the Russian-speaking forums the issue would have needed to be handled through domestic criminal law, as no state could be hold responsible for that private act as a general principle.¹⁰⁰ If the instructions originated from a state organ the criteria for attribution would have been reached under this article, even if the conduct had not been authorised by the machinery of the state itself. Conduct contrary to official mandates or instructions are still considered as the acts of a state organ, constituting ultra vires, presumably they acted in their official capacity.¹⁰¹ However, if the instructions were given by a private person subordinate to the state, but not a state organ, and the individual acted outside the given scope of mandate the conduct may not be construed back to the state as ultra vires in this context would violate the general principle that the conduct of private persons do not invoke the responsibility of states.¹⁰²\nContinuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state.¹⁰³ These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁴ So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁵ The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls'¹⁰⁶, and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'.¹⁰⁷ The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets. Although, still dependent upon the identify of the one who posted the instructions on the website.\nThere are differences in scholarly interpretations in regards to the wording of 'direction or control of', whether they are to be read synonymous and in conjunction or as representing two separate concepts.¹⁰⁸ Would the attribution be tried under 'direction' alone it would be crucial to prove the\n¹⁰⁰ DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n¹⁰¹ DARSIWA, article 7, p. 26\n¹⁰² Macak, p. 11\n¹⁰³ ibid, p. 9\n¹⁰⁴ Bosnian Genocide (n15) (400)\n¹⁰⁵ Macak, p. 9\n¹⁰⁶ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"> 'accessed 28 December 2020'\n¹⁰⁷ Macak, p. 9-10\n¹⁰⁸ ibid, p. 6\n14</http:>\nexistence of a continuous hierarchical relationship in which loose directions had been given and the group progressively worked towards.¹⁰⁹ This is not applicable to this case, and the analysis will therefore treat the wording in conjunction, under ‘direction or control of’.\nThe legacy of the Nicaragua case is the formulation by the ICJ of the ‘effective control test’, which is the prevalent test to determine whether a state’s control over an individual or groups of individuals may give the conduct of said non-state actors an attributional link to the state, making the conduct it’s legal responsibility.¹¹⁰ Supporting a non-state actor in the form of ‘financing, organising, training, supplying or equipping’ might constitute another act of wrongful conduct for the State, as this have been determined in the Nicaragua case to violate the non-intervention principle. Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control.¹¹¹ The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.¹¹²\nThe control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity.¹¹³ The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching.¹¹⁴ The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of.¹¹⁵ Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves.¹¹⁶ This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control.¹¹⁷ Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons. This is where the evidence fail to incriminate the Russian state. Despite the circumstances mentioned above and prior connections between Russia and Nashi, there are no truly concrete evidence revealing a state organ to have been behind the Estonian cyber\n¹⁰⁹ Macak, p. 12\n¹¹⁰ ibid, p. 14\n¹¹¹ ibid, p. 14-15, citing Nicaragua (n 35) (115)\n¹¹² Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹¹³ Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n¹¹⁴ Blank, p. 85-86\n¹¹⁵ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 40\n¹¹⁶ Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n¹¹⁷ Nicaragua (Merits), ICJ Reports 1986, 14 at 64, para. 115\nattacks.¹¹⁸ And less so to have been behind the given instructions, part of the planning or as the one providing continuous support throughout the cyber attacks. What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state¹¹⁹, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.¹²⁰\nThe International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.¹²¹\nThe elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it.¹²² The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'.¹²³ The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'.¹²⁴ Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process.¹²⁵ The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity.¹²⁶ Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events \"will happen more and more\".¹²⁷ It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here.¹²⁸ Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own. The ICJ reasoned as following in the case: \"The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other\n¹¹⁸ Miniats, p. 39\n¹¹⁹ Atwal M, Evaluating Nashi’s Sustainability: Autonomy, Agency and Activism, (2009), p. 40\n¹²⁰ ibid, p.\n¹²¹ DARSIWA, article 11, p. 52\n¹²² DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n¹²³ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n¹²⁴ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n¹²⁵ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (9), p. 53\n¹²⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n¹²⁷ Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed’ 29 December 2020’\n¹²⁸ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n16</https:>\norgans of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them...” caused a change in the legal character of the events, giving rise to Iranian responsibility.¹²⁹ Also relevant from the Tehran Case was a statement given by a state organ that was taken into account by the ICJ. The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”¹³⁰, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’.¹³¹ He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously.¹³² This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB.¹³³ While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.¹³⁴\n¹²⁹ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n¹³⁰ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n¹³¹ Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹³² Tikk, p. 27\n¹³³ Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n¹³⁴ Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n17\n18\n# Georgia 2008\nAfter a long history of icy relations between Georgia and Russia, the latter began a military invasion on the 8th of August in 2008 against Georgian territory.¹³⁵ The background of the conflict relates to Georgia’s efforts to decrease their dependency on Russia. A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead.¹³⁶ Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region. There were separate political views and interests involved, as the area itself were politically more aligned with Russia but physically present inside Georgian boarders.¹³⁷\nA new way of exploiting cyber space revealed itself in relation to the military actions, as it was coincided with and supported by offensive and pre-planned cyber attacks.¹³⁸ The cyber attacks consisted mainly of damaging DDoS-attacks¹³⁹ but Georgia was also subjected to a virtual blockade.¹⁴⁰ The attacks created difficulties for the Georgian government to convey messages to its population and in responding to the military invasion¹⁴¹, as the targets were primarily weapons systems¹⁴², information infrastructure and telecommunications, government websites, banks and transportation companies.¹⁴³ It has been noted that no pro-Russia websites were targeted in the attacks.¹⁴⁴\nGeorgia’s reliance on information technology was at the time very limited, leading the cyber attacks to have a relatively low impact.¹⁴⁵ The attacks were considered unsophisticated, but the coordination of them and they coinciding geographically with kinetic operations have raised suspicion that they were part of a larger and thoroughly organised campaign.¹⁴⁶ This belief gained stronger support as it became evident that as the military clashes increased in intensity, so did the cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ The technical forensic deemed the methods used as moderately sophisticated but the use of them as innovative, revealing ‘planning, organisation, target reconnaissance and evolution of attacks’.¹⁴⁸ The DDoS attacks came in two waves, the first carried out by computers remotely overtaken and inserted with malware designed to attack specific targets.

The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.¹⁵⁰\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials.¹⁵¹ xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began¹⁵², and was kept updated continuously.¹⁵³ stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character.¹⁵⁴ It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses¹⁵⁵, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse.¹⁵⁶ The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.¹⁵⁷\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source.¹⁵⁸ Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence.¹⁵⁹ Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial.¹⁶⁰ Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.¹⁶¹\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network.

To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers.¹⁷¹ Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name.¹⁷² Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace.¹⁷³ As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state¹⁷⁴, and in some instances so do the RBN.¹⁷⁵ Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution. There must exist a clear subordinate relationship where the State exercises some form of control or authority.¹⁷⁶ The constellation of the group of individuals must not be based\n¹⁶² Connell M, Vogler S., p. 13\n¹⁶³ Warren P, <https: 15=\"\" 2007=\"\" now=\"\" news.crime=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 17 December 2020’\n¹⁶⁴ Miniats, p. 50\n¹⁶⁵ McDougal, p. 63\n¹⁶⁶ Markoff J, <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 13iht-13cyber.15227999.html=\"\" 2008=\"\" technology=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 2 January 2021’\n¹⁶⁷ Tikk, p. 75\n¹⁶⁸ McDougal, p. 63\n¹⁶⁹ ibid, p. 63\n¹⁷⁰ Miniats, p. 50\n¹⁷¹ Klimburg, p. 49\n¹⁷² Atwal, p. 743\n¹⁷³ McDougal, p. 63\n¹⁷⁴ Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹⁷⁵ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁷⁶ Macak, p. 9</https:></https:>\naccording to any legal criteria and may thus even be construed by a de facto basis.¹⁷⁷ This is pertinent to our investigation in regards to whether the persons located in different countries an partaking in the cyber attacks may be considered as a coherent group, by which the state could in theory either exercise control over or delegate elements of governmental authority upon.\nUnder article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility such attribution may be concluded if that person or entity is 'empowered by the law' to 'exercise elements of governmental authority'.¹⁷⁸ There are no evidence of the 'patriotic hackers' to have been employed by an actual contract to perform these cyber attacks, that an army function had been outsourced so to say. Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law.¹⁷⁹ As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities.¹⁸⁰ One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial.¹⁸¹ While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison.¹⁸² This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors¹⁸³, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus.¹⁸⁴ When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as\n¹⁷⁷ ibid, p. 8\n¹⁷⁸ DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26\n¹⁷⁹ Macak, p. 10\n¹⁸⁰ ibid, p. 15\n¹⁸¹ Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50\n¹⁸² Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n¹⁸³ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁸⁴ Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\" en=\"\" government=\"\" government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021'\n21\neither instruction or control. The criteria of the instructions not needing to be detailed, but must be in regards to a particular event and clarify the organisational relationship between the two actors.¹⁸⁵ This is beyond any doubt applicable to such a scenario. One might even argue that the state exercises effective control over the individuals, as they would not be able to continue their cyber activities if not for the state’s involvement holding off the punishment of emprisonment. Depending on the circumstances, the state would have the possibility to be involved and oversee specific operations. This is applicable regardless of whether the individual is acting solo, or as part of the the Nashi group or the Russian Business Network. Since the relationship between Nashi and Russia have already been described in the Estonian case that conclusion will be applied here, and following section will focus on whether Russia can be said to exercise effective control over the RBN and the individual ‘patriotic’ hackers.\nAs mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law.¹⁸⁶ This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.¹⁸⁷\nThe hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded.¹⁸⁸ By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere. Some efforts have been made to mitigate their activities with lack of success.¹⁸⁹ Rather contrary, the law enforcement and judicial\n¹⁸⁵ Macak, p.\n¹⁸⁶ Macak, p.\n¹⁸⁷ Klimburg, p. 47\n¹⁸⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n¹⁸⁹ Klimburg, p. 49\n22\nsystem seem to be working in their favour as no members have not found themselves arrested¹⁹⁰ despite their crimes of distribution of spam, malicious malware and child pornography. Both the GRU and the FSB are known to recruit hackers from this group in particular.¹⁹¹ When it concerns financing and equipping, there are no known facts of such transactions between Russia and the RBN. The Russian Business Networks gets their financing from the services they provide, which includes timely rented botnets.¹⁹² There are also unclarity in regards to whether the RBN have acted on the behalf of the state previously or not, which is important for the facts to be accurately interpreted. While some aspects are not recognised in this case, the higher criterium for effective control are nevertheless met. As previously mentioned these consists of 'planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout' the activity.¹⁹³ The prevailing problem is to conclusively prove that it is specifically Russia acting as such in relation to the RBN.\nThe evidence, consisting primarily of the instructions in the forum, speaks strongly of state-involvement mostly due to the spectacular level of coordination with the military advances.¹⁹⁴ They strongly show the intended will of those responsible for the conduct to be performed.¹⁹⁵ It seems to be a thorough plan of attack by cyber means, ready to set in motion when necessary, clearly demonstrating collaboration of some sort with the Russian state.¹⁹⁶ Otherwise such precision in electing targets which would help facilitate the military invasion as it were in this case, would have been too much of a coincident. Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired.¹⁹⁷ The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged.¹⁹⁸ Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components.¹⁹⁹ While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation.²⁰⁰ The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from. The websites used were based on fake identities and did not reveal an actual perpetrator. However, they\n¹⁹⁰ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁹¹ Mshvidobadze K, <https: blogs=\"\" how-to-understand-russia-today=\"\" ukrainealert=\"\" www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 2 January 2021\n¹⁹² Klimburg, p. 49\n¹⁹³ Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n¹⁹⁴ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n¹⁹⁵ Macak, p. 11\n¹⁹⁶ McDougal, p. 63-64\n¹⁹⁷ Blank, p. 89\n¹⁹⁸ ibid, p. 90\n¹⁹⁹ ibid, p. 90\n²⁰⁰ GreyLogic,, p. 20\ncontained a possible lead. The IP address from the corporation providing the hosting services were registered in the United States but physically located in St Petersburg, with their office in the same building as two state institutions and the headquarter of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Russian Armed Forces (GRU) in the area.²⁰¹ This is not strong enough evidence to link the instructions to a state organ, the connection is too far fetch with many open-ended questions. If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity.²⁰² If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.²⁰³ If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.²⁰⁴\nEfforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’.²⁰⁵ While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.²⁰⁶ It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’.²⁰⁷ It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful.²⁰⁸ Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n²⁰¹ GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n²⁰² DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40\n²⁰³ DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26\n²⁰⁴ DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38\n²⁰⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n²⁰⁶ DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53\n²⁰⁷ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n²⁰⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11\n# Conclusion\nThe phenomenon of states relying on the their nationalistic citizens to perpetuate cyber attacks against foreign adversaries is not likely to perish, but rather to flourish. The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations.\n25\n26",

Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.\nKeywords: state responsibility, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyber attack, Russia, hacktivism, Nashi, Russian Business Network, effective control, adoption of act, government authority, Estonia, Georgia, DDoS\n\nIntroduction 4\nLegal Analysis - Breach of Obligation 7\nLegal Analysis - Attribution 8\nEstonia 2007 9\nGeorgia 2008 18\nConclusion 25\nBibliography 26\n# Introduction\nConceptions of warfare has evolved in different directions depending on cultures, time eras and advances in technology. The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time. The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost. Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations. This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing \"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes. Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary. These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid. By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law. The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space. It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society. Cyber attacks are\n Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82\n ibid, p. 84\n McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60\n Blank, p. 82-83\n Blank, p. 93\n Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4\n Blank, p. 83\n Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1\n ibid p. 2\nvalidly considered a national security issue, because of the malicious possibilities it gives to ill-minded individuals. The possible targets are limitless, and can include anything in between a nation’s economy and it’s air defence systems and power grids. Even enclosed networks used by military organisations have been targeted. The effects may destabilize societies, and even debilitate intangible norms and values such as democracy. Under these new circumstances it is the technology of which a state relies on that determines how secure that state is, making industrial states more vulnerable than others.\nIt is not only the damaging effects that entices actors to employ cyber as a means of warfare. From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained. The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible. Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state. The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks. It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws. The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion. The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’* and *‘The Wild West’*, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817\n Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\" a=\"\" were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n ibid\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854\n Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428\n Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1\n Efrony, p. 2\n Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234\n Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384\n5</https:>\nworkings of the cyber system. These conceptions maintains the idea of the cyber domain being anarchic, leaving it open to escalation and an increase in severity with regards to cyber attacks of the future, and the ways in which they can be employed. Consensus have although been reached in acknowledging that international law do apply, leaving the specifics to be a continued issue of debate. The slow international progress on the topic is due to limited knowledge about the technical processes, but is also a result of politics. Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity. The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures. Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’. It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.\nThe legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt. The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested. However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address. Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited. The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of\n Roscini, p 234\n Tran, p 384\n Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2\n Efrony, p. 2-3\n Shany and Schmitt, p. 2\n Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4\n Tran, p. 382\n ibid, p. 387\n ibid, p. 388\n ibid, p. 389\n ibid, p. 390\nService (DDoS) attacks. The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.\n## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation\nIn 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences. This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles). The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question. This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law. The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation. The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states, as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.\nThe second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10\n France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1\n Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842\n Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n ibid, p. 841\n UN Charter, art. 2(4)\nDrawing on the advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case (1996), cyber attacks constitute a use of force as the article 2(4) was clarified by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to apply in relation to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons deployed'.44 Depending on it's scale and effect, a cyber attack might go beyond the use of force and reach the level of an armed attack, giving rise to the state's right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter.45 With the enlightenment of this premise, the thesis will move into the analysis of the cases under the Law on State Responsibility.\n## Legal Analysis - Attribution\nArticle 2 in the ILC's articles contains the elements of an internationally wrongful act. Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate:\n## Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n## Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n## Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n## Article 11. Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\n## Estonia 2007\nDuring a period between April and May in 2007, Estonia was the target of multiple Distributed Denial of Service cyber attacks (DDoS). A country which had heavily integrated information technology into the daily life of their citizens and even government, which worked basically 'paperless'. The attacks are believed to have been prompted by the Estonian decision to transfer a World War II statute from the centra of Tallinn to a more remote place outside the city. The statute commemorated the death of Soviet soldiers during the war, but constituted a painful reminder of soviet occupation for the Estonians. The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity. Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would \"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests. The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.\nThe targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties. The\n DARSIWA, p. 26\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9\n ibid, p. 10\n ibid, p. 10-11\n Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50\n Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11\n ibid, p. 10\nselection of targets appears to have been strategic, since the damaging effects of the attacks brought the services of the society to a halt. The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62\nThere were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68\nRussia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread. However, no conclusive evidence have insofar been unearthed to ascertain\n\n10</https:></https:>\ndirect state involvement.70 Instead, nationalistic hackers appear to have been the direct aggressor. Dmitri Galushkevich, an IT-student from Tallinn with Russian ethnicity, self-claimed responsibility through boasting about his capabilities for executing DDoS attacks against an Estonian political party's website, constituting part of the cyber attacks.71 He is the only individual until this day prosecuted for the unlawful cyber attacks.72\nAlbeit not having stood trial, the international attention has been placed on the russian Nashi Youth Group (наши, meaning 'Ours') due to implications of their involvement in the cyber attacks.73 Konstantin Goloskokov, one of the group's \"commissar\"74, actually admitted in 2009 to have been responsible for the cyber attacks along with some of his 'associates', insinuating the group being responsible for the events.73 Although, according to another interview of his, he claims the cyber attacks was his own initiative, executed without help from neither the Russian state or Nashi.76 The bewilderment continues to grow as Sergei Markov, member of the Russian Duma, acknowledged in a panel discussion that the attack was a \"reaction from civil society\" and at the same time \"was carried out by my assistant. I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person \"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\" is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are\n\n11</https:></https:></https:></https:>\ndone in their official capacity'.81 Whether Goloskokov acted in his official capacity can from the evidence gathered not be determined as the information is insufficient in shining a light on this aspect. The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87\ni. whether the non-state entity was created by the state\nii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance\niii. whether complete control was exercised in fact\niv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group\nThe first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf. Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.\nBeginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'. A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware. The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106\n DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43\n Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6)\n Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38\n DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8\n DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48\n Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020'\n\nContinuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state. These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case. So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case. The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls', and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'. The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets. Although, still dependent upon the identify of the one who posted the instructions on the website.\nThere are differences in scholarly interpretations in regards to the wording of 'direction or control of', whether they are to be read synonymous and in conjunction or as representing two separate concepts. Would the attribution be tried under 'direction' alone it would be crucial to prove the\n DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n DARSIWA, article 7, p. 26\n Macak, p. 11\n ibid, p. 9\n Bosnian Genocide (n15) (400)\n Macak, p. 9\n Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"> 'accessed 28 December 2020'\n Macak, p. 9-10\n ibid, p. 6\n14</http:>\nexistence of a continuous hierarchical relationship in which loose directions had been given and the group progressively worked towards. This is not applicable to this case, and the analysis will therefore treat the wording in conjunction, under ‘direction or control of’.\nThe legacy of the Nicaragua case is the formulation by the ICJ of the ‘effective control test’, which is the prevalent test to determine whether a state’s control over an individual or groups of individuals may give the conduct of said non-state actors an attributional link to the state, making the conduct it’s legal responsibility. Supporting a non-state actor in the form of ‘financing, organising, training, supplying or equipping’ might constitute another act of wrongful conduct for the State, as this have been determined in the Nicaragua case to violate the non-intervention principle. Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control. The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.\nThe control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity. The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching. The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of. Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves. This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control. Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons. This is where the evidence fail to incriminate the Russian state. Despite the circumstances mentioned above and prior connections between Russia and Nashi, there are no truly concrete evidence revealing a state organ to have been behind the Estonian cyber\n Macak, p. 12\n ibid, p. 14\n ibid, p. 14-15, citing Nicaragua (n 35) (115)\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n Blank, p. 85-86\n Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 40\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n Nicaragua (Merits), ICJ Reports 1986, 14 at 64, para. 115\nattacks. And less so to have been behind the given instructions, part of the planning or as the one providing continuous support throughout the cyber attacks. What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.\nThe International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\nThe elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it. The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'. The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'. Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process. The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity. Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events \"will happen more and more\". It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here. Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own. The ICJ reasoned as following in the case: \"The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other\n Miniats, p. 39\n Atwal M, Evaluating Nashi’s Sustainability: Autonomy, Agency and Activism, (2009), p. 40\n ibid, p.\n DARSIWA, article 11, p. 52\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (9), p. 53\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed’ 29 December 2020’\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n16</https:>\norgans of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them...” caused a change in the legal character of the events, giving rise to Iranian responsibility. Also relevant from the Tehran Case was a statement given by a state organ that was taken into account by the ICJ. The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’. He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously. This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB. While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.\n Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Tikk, p. 27\n Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n\n# Georgia 2008\nAfter a long history of icy relations between Georgia and Russia, the latter began a military invasion on the 8th of August in 2008 against Georgian territory. The background of the conflict relates to Georgia’s efforts to decrease their dependency on Russia. A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead. Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region. There were separate political views and interests involved, as the area itself were politically more aligned with Russia but physically present inside Georgian boarders.\nA new way of exploiting cyber space revealed itself in relation to the military actions, as it was coincided with and supported by offensive and pre-planned cyber attacks. The cyber attacks consisted mainly of damaging DDoS-attacks but Georgia was also subjected to a virtual blockade. The attacks created difficulties for the Georgian government to convey messages to its population and in responding to the military invasion, as the targets were primarily weapons systems, information infrastructure and telecommunications, government websites, banks and transportation companies. It has been noted that no pro-Russia websites were targeted in the attacks.\nGeorgia’s reliance on information technology was at the time very limited, leading the cyber attacks to have a relatively low impact. The attacks were considered unsophisticated, but the coordination of them and they coinciding geographically with kinetic operations have raised suspicion that they were part of a larger and thoroughly organised campaign. This belief gained stronger support as it became evident that as the military clashes increased in intensity, so did the cyber attacks. The technical forensic deemed the methods used as moderately sophisticated but the use of them as innovative, revealing ‘planning, organisation, target reconnaissance and evolution of attacks’. The DDoS attacks came in two waves, the first carried out by computers remotely overtaken and inserted with malware designed to attack specific targets. The second wave\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 12\n Miniats, p. 45\n ibid, p. 43\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 43\n Miniats, p. 48\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 46-47\n Blank, p. 88\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n Miniats, p. 49\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n ibid, p. 13\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 44\n ibid, p. 46\ncame from a command and control server which originated from the United States of America. The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials. xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began, and was kept updated continuously. stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character. It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse. The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source. Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence. Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial. Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network. The cyber blockade mentioned earlier was allocated to servers in Turkey and Russia affiliated with the\n A command and control server is...\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 43-44\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Miniats, p. 50\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n GreyLogic, Project Grey Goose Phase II Report: The evolving state of cyber warfare, (2009) p. 15\n Carr J, Inside Cyber Warfare Mapping the Cyber Underworld, (2012) p. 15\n Tikk, p. 75\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 44-45 + Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Tran, p. 389\n Tikk, p. 74-75\n ibid, p. 75\n DARSIWA, article 8, commentary §6, p. 48\n\nAlso believed to have been part of these cyber attacks were the Nashi Youth Group and other hacktivists acting on their own with the help of the instructions posted online. The instructions on how to perform the DDoS-attacks were formulated so as even a beginner hacker could have followed them, most likely as a recruitment strategy similar to Soviet times.\nPart of the difficulties allocating responsibility for the cyber attacks against Georgia are due to what seems to be an entanglement of three distinct actors, sharing similar properties. To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers. Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name. Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace. As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state, and in some instances so do the RBN. Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution. There must exist a clear subordinate relationship where the State exercises some form of control or authority. The constellation of the group of individuals must not be based\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 13\n Warren P, <https: 15=\"\" 2007=\"\" now=\"\" news.crime=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 17 December 2020’\n Miniats, p. 50\n McDougal, p. 63\n Markoff J, <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 13iht-13cyber.15227999.html=\"\" 2008=\"\" technology=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 2 January 2021’\n Tikk, p. 75\n McDougal, p. 63\n ibid, p. 63\n Miniats, p. 50\n Klimburg, p. 49\n Atwal, p. 743\n McDougal, p. 63\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Macak, p. 9</https:></https:>\naccording to any legal criteria and may thus even be construed by a de facto basis. This is pertinent to our investigation in regards to whether the persons located in different countries an partaking in the cyber attacks may be considered as a coherent group, by which the state could in theory either exercise control over or delegate elements of governmental authority upon.\nUnder article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility such attribution may be concluded if that person or entity is 'empowered by the law' to 'exercise elements of governmental authority'. There are no evidence of the 'patriotic hackers' to have been employed by an actual contract to perform these cyber attacks, that an army function had been outsourced so to say. Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law. As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities. One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial. While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison. This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus. When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as\n ibid, p. 8\n DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26\n Macak, p. 10\n ibid, p. 15\n Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50\n Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\" en=\"\" government=\"\" government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021'\n\nAs mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law. This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.\nThe hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded. By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere. Some efforts have been made to mitigate their activities with lack of success. Rather contrary, the law enforcement and judicial\n Macak, p.\n Macak, p.\n Klimburg, p. 47\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Klimburg, p. 49\n\nThe evidence, consisting primarily of the instructions in the forum, speaks strongly of state-involvement mostly due to the spectacular level of coordination with the military advances. They strongly show the intended will of those responsible for the conduct to be performed. It seems to be a thorough plan of attack by cyber means, ready to set in motion when necessary, clearly demonstrating collaboration of some sort with the Russian state. Otherwise such precision in electing targets which would help facilitate the military invasion as it were in this case, would have been too much of a coincident. Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired. The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged. Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components. While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation. The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from. The websites used were based on fake identities and did not reveal an actual perpetrator. However, they\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Mshvidobadze K, <https: blogs=\"\" how-to-understand-russia-today=\"\" ukrainealert=\"\" www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 2 January 2021\n Klimburg, p. 49\n Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Macak, p. 11\n McDougal, p. 63-64\n Blank, p. 89\n ibid, p. 90\n ibid, p. 90\n GreyLogic,, p. 20\ncontained a possible lead. The IP address from the corporation providing the hosting services were registered in the United States but physically located in St Petersburg, with their office in the same building as two state institutions and the headquarter of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Russian Armed Forces (GRU) in the area. This is not strong enough evidence to link the instructions to a state organ, the connection is too far fetch with many open-ended questions. If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity. If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility. If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.\nEfforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’. While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’. It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful. Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40\n DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26\n DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11\n# Conclusion\nThe phenomenon of states relying on the their nationalistic citizens to perpetuate cyber attacks against foreign adversaries is not likely to perish, but rather to flourish. The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations.",

The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time. The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost. Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations. This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing \"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes. Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary. These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid. By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law. The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space. It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society. Cyber attacks are\n Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82\n ibid, p. 84\n McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60\n Blank, p. 82-83\n Blank, p. 93\n Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4\n Blank, p. 83\n Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1\n ibid p. 2\nvalidly considered a national security issue, because of the malicious possibilities it gives to ill-minded individuals. The possible targets are limitless, and can include anything in between a nation’s economy and it’s air defence systems and power grids. Even enclosed networks used by military organisations have been targeted. The effects may destabilize societies, and even debilitate intangible norms and values such as democracy. Under these new circumstances it is the technology of which a state relies on that determines how secure that state is, making industrial states more vulnerable than others.\nIt is not only the damaging effects that entices actors to employ cyber as a means of warfare. From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained. The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible. Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state. The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks. It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws. The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion. The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’* and *‘The Wild West’*, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817\n Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\" a=\"\" were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n ibid\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854\n Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428\n Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1\n Efrony, p. 2\n Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234\n Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384\n5</https:>\nworkings of the cyber system. These conceptions maintains the idea of the cyber domain being anarchic, leaving it open to escalation and an increase in severity with regards to cyber attacks of the future, and the ways in which they can be employed. Consensus have although been reached in acknowledging that international law do apply, leaving the specifics to be a continued issue of debate. The slow international progress on the topic is due to limited knowledge about the technical processes, but is also a result of politics. Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity. The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures. Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’. It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.\nThe legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt. The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested. However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address. Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited. The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of\n Roscini, p 234\n Tran, p 384\n Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2\n Efrony, p. 2-3\n Shany and Schmitt, p. 2\n Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4\n Tran, p. 382\n ibid, p. 387\n ibid, p. 388\n ibid, p. 389\n ibid, p. 390\nService (DDoS) attacks. The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.\n## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation\nIn 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences. This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles). The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question. This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law. The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation. The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states, as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.\nThe second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10\n France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1\n Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842\n Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n ibid, p. 841\n UN Charter, art. 2(4)\nDrawing on the advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case (1996), cyber attacks constitute a use of force as the article 2(4) was clarified by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to apply in relation to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons deployed'.44 Depending on it's scale and effect, a cyber attack might go beyond the use of force and reach the level of an armed attack, giving rise to the state's right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter.45 With the enlightenment of this premise, the thesis will move into the analysis of the cases under the Law on State Responsibility.\n## Legal Analysis - Attribution\nArticle 2 in the ILC's articles contains the elements of an internationally wrongful act. Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate:\n## Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n## Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n## Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n## Article 11. Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\n## Estonia 2007\nDuring a period between April and May in 2007, Estonia was the target of multiple Distributed Denial of Service cyber attacks (DDoS). A country which had heavily integrated information technology into the daily life of their citizens and even government, which worked basically 'paperless'. The attacks are believed to have been prompted by the Estonian decision to transfer a World War II statute from the centra of Tallinn to a more remote place outside the city. The statute commemorated the death of Soviet soldiers during the war, but constituted a painful reminder of soviet occupation for the Estonians. The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity. Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would \"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests. The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.\nThe targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties. The\n DARSIWA, p. 26\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9\n ibid, p. 10\n ibid, p. 10-11\n Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50\n Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11\n ibid, p. 10\nselection of targets appears to have been strategic, since the damaging effects of the attacks brought the services of the society to a halt. The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62\nThere were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68\nRussia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread. However, no conclusive evidence have insofar been unearthed to ascertain\n\n10</https:></https:>\ndirect state involvement.70 Instead, nationalistic hackers appear to have been the direct aggressor. Dmitri Galushkevich, an IT-student from Tallinn with Russian ethnicity, self-claimed responsibility through boasting about his capabilities for executing DDoS attacks against an Estonian political party's website, constituting part of the cyber attacks.71 He is the only individual until this day prosecuted for the unlawful cyber attacks.72\nAlbeit not having stood trial, the international attention has been placed on the russian Nashi Youth Group (наши, meaning 'Ours') due to implications of their involvement in the cyber attacks.73 Konstantin Goloskokov, one of the group's \"commissar\"74, actually admitted in 2009 to have been responsible for the cyber attacks along with some of his 'associates', insinuating the group being responsible for the events.73 Although, according to another interview of his, he claims the cyber attacks was his own initiative, executed without help from neither the Russian state or Nashi.76 The bewilderment continues to grow as Sergei Markov, member of the Russian Duma, acknowledged in a panel discussion that the attack was a \"reaction from civil society\" and at the same time \"was carried out by my assistant. I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person \"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\" is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are\n\n11</https:></https:></https:></https:>\ndone in their official capacity'.81 Whether Goloskokov acted in his official capacity can from the evidence gathered not be determined as the information is insufficient in shining a light on this aspect. The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87\ni. whether the non-state entity was created by the state\nii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance\niii. whether complete control was exercised in fact\niv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group\nThe first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf. Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.\nBeginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'. A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware. The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106\n DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43\n Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6)\n Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38\n DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8\n DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48\n Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020'\n\nContinuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state. These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case. So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case. The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls', and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'. The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets. Although, still dependent upon the identify of the one who posted the instructions on the website.\nThere are differences in scholarly interpretations in regards to the wording of 'direction or control of', whether they are to be read synonymous and in conjunction or as representing two separate concepts. Would the attribution be tried under 'direction' alone it would be crucial to prove the\n DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n DARSIWA, article 7, p. 26\n Macak, p. 11\n ibid, p. 9\n Bosnian Genocide (n15) (400)\n Macak, p. 9\n Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"> 'accessed 28 December 2020'\n Macak, p. 9-10\n ibid, p. 6\n14</http:>\nexistence of a continuous hierarchical relationship in which loose directions had been given and the group progressively worked towards. This is not applicable to this case, and the analysis will therefore treat the wording in conjunction, under ‘direction or control of’.\nThe legacy of the Nicaragua case is the formulation by the ICJ of the ‘effective control test’, which is the prevalent test to determine whether a state’s control over an individual or groups of individuals may give the conduct of said non-state actors an attributional link to the state, making the conduct it’s legal responsibility. Supporting a non-state actor in the form of ‘financing, organising, training, supplying or equipping’ might constitute another act of wrongful conduct for the State, as this have been determined in the Nicaragua case to violate the non-intervention principle. Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control. The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.\nThe control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity. The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching. The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of. Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves. This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control. Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons. This is where the evidence fail to incriminate the Russian state. Despite the circumstances mentioned above and prior connections between Russia and Nashi, there are no truly concrete evidence revealing a state organ to have been behind the Estonian cyber\n Macak, p. 12\n ibid, p. 14\n ibid, p. 14-15, citing Nicaragua (n 35) (115)\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n Blank, p. 85-86\n Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 40\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n Nicaragua (Merits), ICJ Reports 1986, 14 at 64, para. 115\nattacks. And less so to have been behind the given instructions, part of the planning or as the one providing continuous support throughout the cyber attacks. What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.\nThe International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\nThe elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it. The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'. The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'. Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process. The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity. Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events \"will happen more and more\". It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here. Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own. The ICJ reasoned as following in the case: \"The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other\n Miniats, p. 39\n Atwal M, Evaluating Nashi’s Sustainability: Autonomy, Agency and Activism, (2009), p. 40\n ibid, p.\n DARSIWA, article 11, p. 52\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (9), p. 53\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed’ 29 December 2020’\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n16</https:>\norgans of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them...” caused a change in the legal character of the events, giving rise to Iranian responsibility. Also relevant from the Tehran Case was a statement given by a state organ that was taken into account by the ICJ. The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’. He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously. This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB. While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.\n Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Tikk, p. 27\n Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n\n# Georgia 2008\nAfter a long history of icy relations between Georgia and Russia, the latter began a military invasion on the 8th of August in 2008 against Georgian territory. The background of the conflict relates to Georgia’s efforts to decrease their dependency on Russia. A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead. Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region. There were separate political views and interests involved, as the area itself were politically more aligned with Russia but physically present inside Georgian boarders.\nA new way of exploiting cyber space revealed itself in relation to the military actions, as it was coincided with and supported by offensive and pre-planned cyber attacks. The cyber attacks consisted mainly of damaging DDoS-attacks but Georgia was also subjected to a virtual blockade. The attacks created difficulties for the Georgian government to convey messages to its population and in responding to the military invasion, as the targets were primarily weapons systems, information infrastructure and telecommunications, government websites, banks and transportation companies. It has been noted that no pro-Russia websites were targeted in the attacks.\nGeorgia’s reliance on information technology was at the time very limited, leading the cyber attacks to have a relatively low impact. The attacks were considered unsophisticated, but the coordination of them and they coinciding geographically with kinetic operations have raised suspicion that they were part of a larger and thoroughly organised campaign. This belief gained stronger support as it became evident that as the military clashes increased in intensity, so did the cyber attacks. The technical forensic deemed the methods used as moderately sophisticated but the use of them as innovative, revealing ‘planning, organisation, target reconnaissance and evolution of attacks’. The DDoS attacks came in two waves, the first carried out by computers remotely overtaken and inserted with malware designed to attack specific targets. The second wave\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 12\n Miniats, p. 45\n ibid, p. 43\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 43\n Miniats, p. 48\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 46-47\n Blank, p. 88\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n Miniats, p. 49\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n ibid, p. 13\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 44\n ibid, p. 46\ncame from a command and control server which originated from the United States of America. The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials. xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began, and was kept updated continuously. stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character. It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse. The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source. Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence. Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial. Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network. The cyber blockade mentioned earlier was allocated to servers in Turkey and Russia affiliated with the\n A command and control server is...\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 43-44\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Miniats, p. 50\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n GreyLogic, Project Grey Goose Phase II Report: The evolving state of cyber warfare, (2009) p. 15\n Carr J, Inside Cyber Warfare Mapping the Cyber Underworld, (2012) p. 15\n Tikk, p. 75\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 44-45 + Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Tran, p. 389\n Tikk, p. 74-75\n ibid, p. 75\n DARSIWA, article 8, commentary §6, p. 48\n\nAlso believed to have been part of these cyber attacks were the Nashi Youth Group and other hacktivists acting on their own with the help of the instructions posted online. The instructions on how to perform the DDoS-attacks were formulated so as even a beginner hacker could have followed them, most likely as a recruitment strategy similar to Soviet times.\nPart of the difficulties allocating responsibility for the cyber attacks against Georgia are due to what seems to be an entanglement of three distinct actors, sharing similar properties. To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers. Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name. Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace. As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state, and in some instances so do the RBN. Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution. There must exist a clear subordinate relationship where the State exercises some form of control or authority. The constellation of the group of individuals must not be based\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 13\n Warren P, <https: 15=\"\" 2007=\"\" now=\"\" news.crime=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 17 December 2020’\n Miniats, p. 50\n McDougal, p. 63\n Markoff J, <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 13iht-13cyber.15227999.html=\"\" 2008=\"\" technology=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 2 January 2021’\n Tikk, p. 75\n McDougal, p. 63\n ibid, p. 63\n Miniats, p. 50\n Klimburg, p. 49\n Atwal, p. 743\n McDougal, p. 63\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Macak, p. 9</https:></https:>\naccording to any legal criteria and may thus even be construed by a de facto basis. This is pertinent to our investigation in regards to whether the persons located in different countries an partaking in the cyber attacks may be considered as a coherent group, by which the state could in theory either exercise control over or delegate elements of governmental authority upon.\nUnder article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility such attribution may be concluded if that person or entity is 'empowered by the law' to 'exercise elements of governmental authority'. There are no evidence of the 'patriotic hackers' to have been employed by an actual contract to perform these cyber attacks, that an army function had been outsourced so to say. Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law. As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities. One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial. While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison. This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus. When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as\n ibid, p. 8\n DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26\n Macak, p. 10\n ibid, p. 15\n Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50\n Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\" en=\"\" government=\"\" government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021'\n\nAs mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law. This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.\nThe hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded. By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere. Some efforts have been made to mitigate their activities with lack of success. Rather contrary, the law enforcement and judicial\n Macak, p.\n Macak, p.\n Klimburg, p. 47\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Klimburg, p. 49\n\nThe evidence, consisting primarily of the instructions in the forum, speaks strongly of state-involvement mostly due to the spectacular level of coordination with the military advances. They strongly show the intended will of those responsible for the conduct to be performed. It seems to be a thorough plan of attack by cyber means, ready to set in motion when necessary, clearly demonstrating collaboration of some sort with the Russian state. Otherwise such precision in electing targets which would help facilitate the military invasion as it were in this case, would have been too much of a coincident. Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired. The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged. Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components. While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation. The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from. The websites used were based on fake identities and did not reveal an actual perpetrator. However, they\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Mshvidobadze K, <https: blogs=\"\" how-to-understand-russia-today=\"\" ukrainealert=\"\" www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 2 January 2021\n Klimburg, p. 49\n Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Macak, p. 11\n McDougal, p. 63-64\n Blank, p. 89\n ibid, p. 90\n ibid, p. 90\n GreyLogic,, p. 20\ncontained a possible lead. The IP address from the corporation providing the hosting services were registered in the United States but physically located in St Petersburg, with their office in the same building as two state institutions and the headquarter of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Russian Armed Forces (GRU) in the area. This is not strong enough evidence to link the instructions to a state organ, the connection is too far fetch with many open-ended questions. If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity. If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility. If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.\nEfforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’. While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’. It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful. Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40\n DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26\n DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11\n# Conclusion\nThe phenomenon of states relying on the their nationalistic citizens to perpetuate cyber attacks against foreign adversaries is not likely to perish, but rather to flourish. The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations.",

Whether it would be a private person solely, a private person under the subordination of the state or a state organ itself would remarkably alter the outcome of the analysis. Were the scenario of a private person initiating the attacks and disseminating the instructions in the Russian-speaking forums the issue would have needed to be handled through domestic criminal law, as no state could be hold responsible for that private act as a general principle.¹⁰⁰ If the instructions originated from a state organ the criteria for attribution would have been reached under this article, even if the conduct had not been authorised by the machinery of the state itself. Conduct contrary to official mandates or instructions are still considered as the acts of a state organ, constituting ultra vires, presumably they acted in their official capacity.¹⁰¹ However, if the instructions were given by a private person subordinate to the state, but not a state organ, and the individual acted outside the given scope of mandate the conduct may not be construed back to the state as ultra vires in this context would violate the general principle that the conduct of private persons do not invoke the responsibility of states.¹⁰²",

One might even argue that the state exercises effective control over the individuals, as they would not be able to continue their cyber activities if not for the state’s involvement holding off the punishment of emprisonment. Depending on the circumstances, the state would have the possibility to be involved and oversee specific operations. This is applicable regardless of whether the individual is acting solo, or as part of the the Nashi group or the Russian Business Network. Since the relationship between Nashi and Russia have already been described in the Estonian case that conclusion will be applied here, and following section will focus on whether Russia can be said to exercise effective control over the RBN and the individual ‘patriotic’ hackers.",

Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.\nKeywords: state responsibility, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyber attack, Russia, hacktivism, Nashi, Russian Business Network, effective control, adoption of act, government authority, Estonia, Georgia, DDoS\n\nIntroduction 4\nLegal Analysis - Breach of Obligation 7\nLegal Analysis - Attribution 8\nEstonia 2007 9\nGeorgia 2008 18\nConclusion 25\nBibliography 26\n# Introduction\nConceptions of warfare has evolved in different directions depending on cultures, time eras and advances in technology. The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time. The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost. Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations. This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing \"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes. Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary. These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid. By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law. The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space. It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society. Cyber attacks are\n Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82\n ibid, p. 84\n McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60\n Blank, p. 82-83\n Blank, p. 93\n Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4\n Blank, p. 83\n Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1\n ibid p. 2\nvalidly considered a national security issue, because of the malicious possibilities it gives to ill-minded individuals. The possible targets are limitless, and can include anything in between a nation’s economy and it’s air defence systems and power grids. Even enclosed networks used by military organisations have been targeted. The effects may destabilize societies, and even debilitate intangible norms and values such as democracy. Under these new circumstances it is the technology of which a state relies on that determines how secure that state is, making industrial states more vulnerable than others.\nIt is not only the damaging effects that entices actors to employ cyber as a means of warfare. From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained. The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible. Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state. The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks. It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws. The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion. The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’* and *‘The Wild West’*, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817\n Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\" a=\"\" were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n ibid\n Efrony, p. 2\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854\n Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428\n Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1\n Efrony, p. 2\n Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234\n Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384\n5</https:>\nworkings of the cyber system. These conceptions maintains the idea of the cyber domain being anarchic, leaving it open to escalation and an increase in severity with regards to cyber attacks of the future, and the ways in which they can be employed. Consensus have although been reached in acknowledging that international law do apply, leaving the specifics to be a continued issue of debate. The slow international progress on the topic is due to limited knowledge about the technical processes, but is also a result of politics. Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity. The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures. Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’. It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.\nThe legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt. The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested. However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address. Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited. The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of\n Roscini, p 234\n Tran, p 384\n Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2\n Efrony, p. 2-3\n Shany and Schmitt, p. 2\n Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4\n Tran, p. 382\n ibid, p. 387\n ibid, p. 388\n ibid, p. 389\n ibid, p. 390\nService (DDoS) attacks. The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.\n## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation\nIn 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences. This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles). The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question. This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law. The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation. The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states, as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.\nThe second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10\n France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1\n Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842\n Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7\n Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n ibid, p. 841\n UN Charter, art. 2(4)\nDrawing on the advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case (1996), cyber attacks constitute a use of force as the article 2(4) was clarified by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to apply in relation to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons deployed'.44 Depending on it's scale and effect, a cyber attack might go beyond the use of force and reach the level of an armed attack, giving rise to the state's right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter.45 With the enlightenment of this premise, the thesis will move into the analysis of the cases under the Law on State Responsibility.\n## Legal Analysis - Attribution\nArticle 2 in the ILC's articles contains the elements of an internationally wrongful act. Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate:\n## Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n## Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n## Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n## Article 11. Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\n## Estonia 2007\nDuring a period between April and May in 2007, Estonia was the target of multiple Distributed Denial of Service cyber attacks (DDoS). A country which had heavily integrated information technology into the daily life of their citizens and even government, which worked basically 'paperless'. The attacks are believed to have been prompted by the Estonian decision to transfer a World War II statute from the centra of Tallinn to a more remote place outside the city. The statute commemorated the death of Soviet soldiers during the war, but constituted a painful reminder of soviet occupation for the Estonians. The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity. Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would \"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests. The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.\nThe targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties. The\n DARSIWA, p. 26\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9\n ibid, p. 10\n ibid, p. 10-11\n Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50\n Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11\n ibid, p. 10\nselection of targets appears to have been strategic, since the damaging effects of the attacks brought the services of the society to a halt. The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62\nThere were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68\nRussia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread. However, no conclusive evidence have insofar been unearthed to ascertain\n\n10</https:></https:>\ndirect state involvement.70 Instead, nationalistic hackers appear to have been the direct aggressor. Dmitri Galushkevich, an IT-student from Tallinn with Russian ethnicity, self-claimed responsibility through boasting about his capabilities for executing DDoS attacks against an Estonian political party's website, constituting part of the cyber attacks.71 He is the only individual until this day prosecuted for the unlawful cyber attacks.72\nAlbeit not having stood trial, the international attention has been placed on the russian Nashi Youth Group (наши, meaning 'Ours') due to implications of their involvement in the cyber attacks.73 Konstantin Goloskokov, one of the group's \"commissar\"74, actually admitted in 2009 to have been responsible for the cyber attacks along with some of his 'associates', insinuating the group being responsible for the events.73 Although, according to another interview of his, he claims the cyber attacks was his own initiative, executed without help from neither the Russian state or Nashi.76 The bewilderment continues to grow as Sergei Markov, member of the Russian Duma, acknowledged in a panel discussion that the attack was a \"reaction from civil society\" and at the same time \"was carried out by my assistant. I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person \"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\" is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are\n\n11</https:></https:></https:></https:>\ndone in their official capacity'.81 Whether Goloskokov acted in his official capacity can from the evidence gathered not be determined as the information is insufficient in shining a light on this aspect. The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87\ni. whether the non-state entity was created by the state\nii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance\niii. whether complete control was exercised in fact\niv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group\nThe first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf. Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.\nBeginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'. A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware. The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an\n Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106\n DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43\n Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6)\n Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38\n DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8\n DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48\n Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020'\n\nContinuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state. These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case. So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case. The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls', and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'. The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets. Although, still dependent upon the identify of the one who posted the instructions on the website.\nThere are differences in scholarly interpretations in regards to the wording of 'direction or control of', whether they are to be read synonymous and in conjunction or as representing two separate concepts. Would the attribution be tried under 'direction' alone it would be crucial to prove the\n DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n DARSIWA, article 7, p. 26\n Macak, p. 11\n ibid, p. 9\n Bosnian Genocide (n15) (400)\n Macak, p. 9\n Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"> 'accessed 28 December 2020'\n Macak, p. 9-10\n ibid, p. 6\n14</http:>\nexistence of a continuous hierarchical relationship in which loose directions had been given and the group progressively worked towards. This is not applicable to this case, and the analysis will therefore treat the wording in conjunction, under ‘direction or control of’.\nThe legacy of the Nicaragua case is the formulation by the ICJ of the ‘effective control test’, which is the prevalent test to determine whether a state’s control over an individual or groups of individuals may give the conduct of said non-state actors an attributional link to the state, making the conduct it’s legal responsibility. Supporting a non-state actor in the form of ‘financing, organising, training, supplying or equipping’ might constitute another act of wrongful conduct for the State, as this have been determined in the Nicaragua case to violate the non-intervention principle. Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control. The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.\nThe control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity. The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching. The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of. Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves. This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control. Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons. This is where the evidence fail to incriminate the Russian state. Despite the circumstances mentioned above and prior connections between Russia and Nashi, there are no truly concrete evidence revealing a state organ to have been behind the Estonian cyber\n Macak, p. 12\n ibid, p. 14\n ibid, p. 14-15, citing Nicaragua (n 35) (115)\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n Blank, p. 85-86\n Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 40\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n Nicaragua (Merits), ICJ Reports 1986, 14 at 64, para. 115\nattacks. And less so to have been behind the given instructions, part of the planning or as the one providing continuous support throughout the cyber attacks. What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.\nThe International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\nThe elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it. The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'. The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'. Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process. The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity. Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events \"will happen more and more\". It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here. Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own. The ICJ reasoned as following in the case: \"The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other\n Miniats, p. 39\n Atwal M, Evaluating Nashi’s Sustainability: Autonomy, Agency and Activism, (2009), p. 40\n ibid, p.\n DARSIWA, article 11, p. 52\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (9), p. 53\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed’ 29 December 2020’\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n16</https:>\norgans of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them...” caused a change in the legal character of the events, giving rise to Iranian responsibility. Also relevant from the Tehran Case was a statement given by a state organ that was taken into account by the ICJ. The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’. He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously. This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB. While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.\n Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Tikk, p. 27\n Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n\n# Georgia 2008\nAfter a long history of icy relations between Georgia and Russia, the latter began a military invasion on the 8th of August in 2008 against Georgian territory. The background of the conflict relates to Georgia’s efforts to decrease their dependency on Russia. A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead. Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region. There were separate political views and interests involved, as the area itself were politically more aligned with Russia but physically present inside Georgian boarders.\nA new way of exploiting cyber space revealed itself in relation to the military actions, as it was coincided with and supported by offensive and pre-planned cyber attacks. The cyber attacks consisted mainly of damaging DDoS-attacks but Georgia was also subjected to a virtual blockade. The attacks created difficulties for the Georgian government to convey messages to its population and in responding to the military invasion, as the targets were primarily weapons systems, information infrastructure and telecommunications, government websites, banks and transportation companies. It has been noted that no pro-Russia websites were targeted in the attacks.\nGeorgia’s reliance on information technology was at the time very limited, leading the cyber attacks to have a relatively low impact. The attacks were considered unsophisticated, but the coordination of them and they coinciding geographically with kinetic operations have raised suspicion that they were part of a larger and thoroughly organised campaign. This belief gained stronger support as it became evident that as the military clashes increased in intensity, so did the cyber attacks. The technical forensic deemed the methods used as moderately sophisticated but the use of them as innovative, revealing ‘planning, organisation, target reconnaissance and evolution of attacks’. The DDoS attacks came in two waves, the first carried out by computers remotely overtaken and inserted with malware designed to attack specific targets. The second wave\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 12\n Miniats, p. 45\n ibid, p. 43\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 43\n Miniats, p. 48\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 46-47\n Blank, p. 88\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n Miniats, p. 49\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n ibid, p. 13\n Heickerö R, FOI., p. 44\n ibid, p. 46\ncame from a command and control server which originated from the United States of America. The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials. xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began, and was kept updated continuously. stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character. It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse. The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source. Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence. Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial. Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network. The cyber blockade mentioned earlier was allocated to servers in Turkey and Russia affiliated with the\n A command and control server is...\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 43-44\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Miniats, p. 50\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n GreyLogic, Project Grey Goose Phase II Report: The evolving state of cyber warfare, (2009) p. 15\n Carr J, Inside Cyber Warfare Mapping the Cyber Underworld, (2012) p. 15\n Tikk, p. 75\n Heickerö R, FOI, p. 44-45 + Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Tran, p. 389\n Tikk, p. 74-75\n ibid, p. 75\n DARSIWA, article 8, commentary §6, p. 48\n\nAlso believed to have been part of these cyber attacks were the Nashi Youth Group and other hacktivists acting on their own with the help of the instructions posted online. The instructions on how to perform the DDoS-attacks were formulated so as even a beginner hacker could have followed them, most likely as a recruitment strategy similar to Soviet times.\nPart of the difficulties allocating responsibility for the cyber attacks against Georgia are due to what seems to be an entanglement of three distinct actors, sharing similar properties. To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers. Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name. Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace. As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state, and in some instances so do the RBN. Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution. There must exist a clear subordinate relationship where the State exercises some form of control or authority. The constellation of the group of individuals must not be based\n Connell M, Vogler S., p. 13\n Warren P, <https: 15=\"\" 2007=\"\" now=\"\" news.crime=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 17 December 2020’\n Miniats, p. 50\n McDougal, p. 63\n Markoff J, <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 13iht-13cyber.15227999.html=\"\" 2008=\"\" technology=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 2 January 2021’\n Tikk, p. 75\n McDougal, p. 63\n ibid, p. 63\n Miniats, p. 50\n Klimburg, p. 49\n Atwal, p. 743\n McDougal, p. 63\n Kadlecova, p. 41\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Macak, p. 9</https:></https:>\naccording to any legal criteria and may thus even be construed by a de facto basis. This is pertinent to our investigation in regards to whether the persons located in different countries an partaking in the cyber attacks may be considered as a coherent group, by which the state could in theory either exercise control over or delegate elements of governmental authority upon.\nUnder article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility such attribution may be concluded if that person or entity is 'empowered by the law' to 'exercise elements of governmental authority'. There are no evidence of the 'patriotic hackers' to have been employed by an actual contract to perform these cyber attacks, that an army function had been outsourced so to say. Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law. As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities. One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial. While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison. This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus. When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as\n ibid, p. 8\n DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26\n Macak, p. 10\n ibid, p. 15\n Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50\n Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\" en=\"\" government=\"\" government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021'\n\nAs mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law. This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.\nThe hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded. By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere. Some efforts have been made to mitigate their activities with lack of success. Rather contrary, the law enforcement and judicial\n Macak, p.\n Macak, p.\n Klimburg, p. 47\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Klimburg, p. 49\n\nThe evidence, consisting primarily of the instructions in the forum, speaks strongly of state-involvement mostly due to the spectacular level of coordination with the military advances. They strongly show the intended will of those responsible for the conduct to be performed. It seems to be a thorough plan of attack by cyber means, ready to set in motion when necessary, clearly demonstrating collaboration of some sort with the Russian state. Otherwise such precision in electing targets which would help facilitate the military invasion as it were in this case, would have been too much of a coincident. Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired. The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged. Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components. While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation. The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from. The websites used were based on fake identities and did not reveal an actual perpetrator. However, they\n Klimburg, p. 50\n Mshvidobadze K, <https: blogs=\"\" how-to-understand-russia-today=\"\" ukrainealert=\"\" www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 2 January 2021\n Klimburg, p. 49\n Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n Macak, p. 11\n McDougal, p. 63-64\n Blank, p. 89\n ibid, p. 90\n ibid, p. 90\n GreyLogic,, p. 20\ncontained a possible lead. The IP address from the corporation providing the hosting services were registered in the United States but physically located in St Petersburg, with their office in the same building as two state institutions and the headquarter of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Russian Armed Forces (GRU) in the area. This is not strong enough evidence to link the instructions to a state organ, the connection is too far fetch with many open-ended questions. If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity. If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility. If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.\nEfforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’. While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’. It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful. Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40\n DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26\n DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38\n Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53\n DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11\n# Conclusion\nThe phenomenon of states relying on the their nationalistic citizens to perpetuate cyber attacks against foreign adversaries is not likely to perish, but rather to flourish. The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations."

Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.\nKeywords: state responsibility, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyber attack, Russia, hacktivism, Nashi, Russian Business Network, effective control, adoption of act, government authority, Estonia, Georgia, DDoS\n3\nTable of Contents\nIntroduction 4\nLegal Analysis - Breach of Obligation 7\nLegal Analysis - Attribution 8\nEstonia 2007 9\nGeorgia 2008 18\nConclusion 25\nBibliography 26\n# Introduction\nConceptions of warfare has evolved in different directions depending on cultures, time eras and advances in technology. The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time.¹ The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost.² Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations.³ This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing \"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes.⁴ Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary.⁵ These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid.⁶ By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law.⁷ The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space.⁸ It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society.⁹ Cyber attacks are\n¹ Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82\n² ibid, p. 84\n³ McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60\n⁴ Blank, p. 82-83\n⁵ Blank, p. 93\n⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4\n⁷ Blank, p. 83\n⁸ Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1\n⁹ ibid p. 2\nvalidly considered a national security issue, because of the malicious possibilities it gives to ill-minded individuals.¹⁰ The possible targets are limitless, and can include anything in between a nation’s economy¹¹ and it’s air defence systems and power grids.¹² Even enclosed networks used by military organisations have been targeted.¹³ The effects may destabilize societies, and even debilitate intangible norms and values such as democracy.¹⁴ Under these new circumstances it is the technology of which a state relies on that determines how secure that state is, making industrial states more vulnerable than others.¹⁵\nIt is not only the damaging effects that entices actors to employ cyber as a means of warfare. From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained.¹⁶ The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible.¹⁷ Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state.¹⁸ The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks.¹⁹ It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws.²⁰ The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion.²¹ The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’*²² and *‘The Wild West’*²³, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner\n¹⁰ Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817\n¹¹ Efrony, p. 2\n¹² Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817\n¹³ Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\" a=\"\" were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’\n¹⁴ Efrony, p. 2\n¹⁵ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n¹⁶ ibid\n¹⁷ Efrony, p. 2\n¹⁸ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854\n¹⁹ Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428\n²⁰ Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1\n²¹ Efrony, p. 2\n²² Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234\n²³ Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384\n5</https:>\nworkings of the cyber system.²⁴ These conceptions maintains the idea of the cyber domain being anarchic, leaving it open to escalation and an increase in severity with regards to cyber attacks of the future, and the ways in which they can be employed.²⁵ Consensus have although been reached in acknowledging that international law do apply, leaving the specifics to be a continued issue of debate.²⁶ The slow international progress on the topic is due to limited knowledge about the technical processes, but is also a result of politics. Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity.²⁷ The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures.²⁸ Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’.²⁹ It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.³⁰\nThe legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt.³¹ The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested.³² However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address.³³ Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited.³⁴ The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of\n²⁴ Roscini, p 234\n²⁵ Tran, p 384\n²⁶ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2\n²⁷ Efrony, p. 2-3\n²⁸ Shany and Schmitt, p. 2\n²⁹ Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4\n³⁰ Tran, p. 382\n³¹ ibid, p. 387\n³² ibid, p. 388\n³³ ibid, p. 389\n³⁴ ibid, p. 390\nService (DDoS) attacks. The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.³⁵\n## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation\nIn 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences.³⁶ This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles).³⁷ The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question.³⁸ This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law.³⁹ The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation.⁴⁰ The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states,⁴¹ as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.⁴²\nThe second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.⁴³\n³⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10\n³⁶ France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n³⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1\n³⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10\n³⁹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842\n⁴⁰ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7\n⁴¹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842\n⁴² ibid, p. 841\n⁴³ UN Charter, art. 2(4)\nDrawing on the advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case (1996), cyber attacks constitute a use of force as the article 2(4) was clarified by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to apply in relation to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons deployed'.44 Depending on it's scale and effect, a cyber attack might go beyond the use of force and reach the level of an armed attack, giving rise to the state's right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter.45 With the enlightenment of this premise, the thesis will move into the analysis of the cases under the Law on State Responsibility.\n## Legal Analysis - Attribution\nArticle 2 in the ILC's articles contains the elements of an internationally wrongful act. Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate:\n## Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n## Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n44 Kondoch B, *Jus ad Bellum and Cyber Warfare in Northeast Asia*, (2013), p. 468\n45 Schmitt M, *Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations* (2nd edn Cambridge University Press 2017), p. 54\n46 DARSIWA, Article 2, Commentaries, p. 34\n47 DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n48 DARSIWA, Article 4, Commentaries, p. 40\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n## Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by a State\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n## Article 11. Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own\nConduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.⁴⁹\n## Estonia 2007\nDuring a period between April and May in 2007, Estonia was the target of multiple Distributed Denial of Service cyber attacks (DDoS).⁵⁰ A country which had heavily integrated information technology into the daily life of their citizens and even government, which worked basically 'paperless'.⁵¹ The attacks are believed to have been prompted by the Estonian decision to transfer a World War II statute from the centra of Tallinn to a more remote place outside the city.⁵² The statute commemorated the death of Soviet soldiers during the war, but constituted a painful reminder of soviet occupation for the Estonians. The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity.⁵³ Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would \"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests.⁵⁴ The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.⁵⁵\nThe targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties.⁵⁶ The\n⁴⁹ DARSIWA, p. 26\n⁵⁰ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9\n⁵¹ ibid, p. 10\n⁵² ibid, p. 10-11\n⁵³ Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50\n⁵⁴ Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36\n⁵⁵ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11\n⁵⁶ ibid, p. 10\nselection of targets appears to have been strategic, since the damaging effects of the attacks brought the services of the society to a halt. The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62\nThere were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68\nRussia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread. However, no conclusive evidence have insofar been unearthed to ascertain\n57 ibid p. 10-11\n58 Heickerö R, FOI, Emerging Cyber Threats and Russian Views on Information Warfare and Information Operations (2010), p. 40\n59 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n60 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 11\n61 Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n62 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n63 Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n64 ibid, p. 41\n65 Kash W, <https: 06=\"\" 13=\"\" 2008=\"\" articles=\"\" lauri-almann--lessons-from-the-cyberattacks-on-Estonia.aspx?page=\"1\" gcn.com=\"\"> 'accessed 3 December 2020'\n66 Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n67 Connell M, Vogler S, p. 11\n68 ibid, p. 10-11\n69 Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed' 25 December 2020'\n10</https:></https:>\ndirect state involvement.70 Instead, nationalistic hackers appear to have been the direct aggressor. Dmitri Galushkevich, an IT-student from Tallinn with Russian ethnicity, self-claimed responsibility through boasting about his capabilities for executing DDoS attacks against an Estonian political party's website, constituting part of the cyber attacks.71 He is the only individual until this day prosecuted for the unlawful cyber attacks.72\nAlbeit not having stood trial, the international attention has been placed on the russian Nashi Youth Group (наши, meaning 'Ours') due to implications of their involvement in the cyber attacks.73 Konstantin Goloskokov, one of the group's \"commissar\"74, actually admitted in 2009 to have been responsible for the cyber attacks along with some of his 'associates', insinuating the group being responsible for the events.73 Although, according to another interview of his, he claims the cyber attacks was his own initiative, executed without help from neither the Russian state or Nashi.76 The bewilderment continues to grow as Sergei Markov, member of the Russian Duma, acknowledged in a panel discussion that the attack was a \"reaction from civil society\" and at the same time \"was carried out by my assistant. I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person \"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\" is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are\n70 Heickerö R, FOI., p. 42\n71 Tikk E, Vihul L, Kaska K, International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations, (2010), p. 23\n72 Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 41\n73 ibid, p. 40\n74 \"Commissar\" was the formal title for head of a government department in the Soviet Union, Cambridge Dictionary, <https: dictionary=\"\" dictionary.cambridge.org=\"\" english=\"\" commissar=\"\"> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n75 Shahtman N, <https: 03=\"\" 2009=\"\" pro-kremlin-gro=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n76 Lowe C, <https: article=\"\" us-russia-estonia-cyberspace-idustre52b4d820090313=\"\" www.reuters.com=\"\"> 'accessed 25 December 2020'\n77 Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed' 25 December 2020'\n78 Arnold C, <https: 1564694.html=\"\" a=\"\" duma=\"\" duma.gov.ru=\"\" en=\"\" en=\"\" gov.=\"\" gova=\"\" n=\"\" numa=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> 'accessed 26 December 2020'\n79 Russian Government, <http: about=\"\" duma=\"\" duma.gov.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 26 December 2020'\n80 DARSIWA, Article 4, Commentary para. 3, p. 40\n11</https:></https:></https:></https:>\ndone in their official capacity'.81 Whether Goloskokov acted in his official capacity can from the evidence gathered not be determined as the information is insufficient in shining a light on this aspect. The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87\ni. whether the non-state entity was created by the state\nii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance\niii. whether complete control was exercised in fact\niv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group\nThe first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n81 Salvador Commercial Company, UNRIAA, vol.

The result of which could be permissible attribution under article 5. Launching attacks are generally considered to be a matter of the State's military department, and as cyber are considered to constitute an attack just as much as those of kinetics this may be assumed to apply.⁹⁰ The analysis may also rely on the cultural dependent-aspect of determining what constitute elements of governmental authority, which is fortunate in the particular case of Russia.⁹¹ The nature of Russian warfare has a prominent core of psychological and information operations, which encompasses even their theoretical conception of warfare and international relations.⁹² Cyber attacks have become a new means through which they may conduct these operations, and it has been evident in the cyber attacks against Estonia. Based on this, the group may be considered to have exercised elements of governmental authority. One additional criteria for the invocation of article 5 states that the group must also be 'empowered by the law of that State' to exercise such functions. This requires a statute or contractual agreement.⁹³ This has not been found in the relationship between Nashi and the Russian Federation. Conclusively, it is evident that the relationship is not contractual, but rather built on financing and inter-personal relations such as visits and speech-givings.⁹⁴ Russia may therefore not be held responsible for these cyber attacks on Estonia on basis of article 5 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf.⁹⁵ Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.⁹⁶\nBeginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'.⁹⁷ A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware.⁹⁸ The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites⁹⁹, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an\n⁹⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106\n⁹¹ DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43\n⁹² Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n⁹³ DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6)\n⁹⁴ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38\n⁹⁵ DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8\n⁹⁶ DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48\n⁹⁷ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11\n⁹⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10\n⁹⁹ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020'\n13\nunlawful act. Despite this, it is not enough for assuming Russian responsibility, as there is unclarity in regards to who actually posted these instructions. Whether it would be a private person solely, a private person under the subordination of the state or a state organ itself would remarkably alter the outcome of the analysis. Were the scenario of a private person initiating the attacks and disseminating the instructions in the Russian-speaking forums the issue would have needed to be handled through domestic criminal law, as no state could be hold responsible for that private act as a general principle.¹⁰⁰ If the instructions originated from a state organ the criteria for attribution would have been reached under this article, even if the conduct had not been authorised by the machinery of the state itself. Conduct contrary to official mandates or instructions are still considered as the acts of a state organ, constituting ultra vires, presumably they acted in their official capacity.¹⁰¹ However, if the instructions were given by a private person subordinate to the state, but not a state organ, and the individual acted outside the given scope of mandate the conduct may not be construed back to the state as ultra vires in this context would violate the general principle that the conduct of private persons do not invoke the responsibility of states.¹⁰²\nContinuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state.¹⁰³ These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁴ So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁵ The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls'¹⁰⁶, and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'.¹⁰⁷ The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets. Although, still dependent upon the identify of the one who posted the instructions on the website.\nThere are differences in scholarly interpretations in regards to the wording of 'direction or control of', whether they are to be read synonymous and in conjunction or as representing two separate concepts.¹⁰⁸ Would the attribution be tried under 'direction' alone it would be crucial to prove the\n¹⁰⁰ DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38\n¹⁰¹ DARSIWA, article 7, p. 26\n¹⁰² Macak, p. 11\n¹⁰³ ibid, p. 9\n¹⁰⁴ Bosnian Genocide (n15) (400)\n¹⁰⁵ Macak, p. 9\n¹⁰⁶ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\" 2007=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" ff-estonia=\"\" www.wired.com=\"\"> 'accessed 28 December 2020'\n¹⁰⁷ Macak, p. 9-10\n¹⁰⁸ ibid, p. 6\n14</http:>\nexistence of a continuous hierarchical relationship in which loose directions had been given and the group progressively worked towards.¹⁰⁹ This is not applicable to this case, and the analysis will therefore treat the wording in conjunction, under ‘direction or control of’.\nThe legacy of the Nicaragua case is the formulation by the ICJ of the ‘effective control test’, which is the prevalent test to determine whether a state’s control over an individual or groups of individuals may give the conduct of said non-state actors an attributional link to the state, making the conduct it’s legal responsibility.¹¹⁰ Supporting a non-state actor in the form of ‘financing, organising, training, supplying or equipping’ might constitute another act of wrongful conduct for the State, as this have been determined in the Nicaragua case to violate the non-intervention principle. Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control.¹¹¹ The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.¹¹²\nThe control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity.¹¹³ The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching.¹¹⁴ The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of.¹¹⁵ Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves.¹¹⁶ This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control.¹¹⁷ Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons. This is where the evidence fail to incriminate the Russian state. Despite the circumstances mentioned above and prior connections between Russia and Nashi, there are no truly concrete evidence revealing a state organ to have been behind the Estonian cyber\n¹⁰⁹ Macak, p. 12\n¹¹⁰ ibid, p. 14\n¹¹¹ ibid, p. 14-15, citing Nicaragua (n 35) (115)\n¹¹² Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹¹³ Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n¹¹⁴ Blank, p. 85-86\n¹¹⁵ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 40\n¹¹⁶ Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41\n¹¹⁷ Nicaragua (Merits), ICJ Reports 1986, 14 at 64, para. 115\nattacks.¹¹⁸ And less so to have been behind the given instructions, part of the planning or as the one providing continuous support throughout the cyber attacks. What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state¹¹⁹, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.¹²⁰\nThe International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.¹²¹\nThe elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it.¹²² The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'.¹²³ The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'.¹²⁴ Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process.¹²⁵ The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity.¹²⁶ Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events \"will happen more and more\".¹²⁷ It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here.¹²⁸ Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own. The ICJ reasoned as following in the case: \"The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other\n¹¹⁸ Miniats, p. 39\n¹¹⁹ Atwal M, Evaluating Nashi’s Sustainability: Autonomy, Agency and Activism, (2009), p. 40\n¹²⁰ ibid, p.\n¹²¹ DARSIWA, article 11, p. 52\n¹²² DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n¹²³ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n¹²⁴ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53\n¹²⁵ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (9), p. 53\n¹²⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n¹²⁷ Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\" a=\"\" behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\" www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed’ 29 December 2020’\n¹²⁸ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n16</https:>\norgans of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them...” caused a change in the legal character of the events, giving rise to Iranian responsibility.¹²⁹ Also relevant from the Tehran Case was a statement given by a state organ that was taken into account by the ICJ. The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”¹³⁰, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’.¹³¹ He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously.¹³² This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB.¹³³ While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.¹³⁴\n¹²⁹ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n¹³⁰ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35\n¹³¹ Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹³² Tikk, p. 27\n¹³³ Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n¹³⁴ Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n17\n18\n# Georgia 2008\nAfter a long history of icy relations between Georgia and Russia, the latter began a military invasion on the 8th of August in 2008 against Georgian territory.¹³⁵ The background of the conflict relates to Georgia’s efforts to decrease their dependency on Russia. A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead.¹³⁶ Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region. There were separate political views and interests involved, as the area itself were politically more aligned with Russia but physically present inside Georgian boarders.¹³⁷\nA new way of exploiting cyber space revealed itself in relation to the military actions, as it was coincided with and supported by offensive and pre-planned cyber attacks.¹³⁸ The cyber attacks consisted mainly of damaging DDoS-attacks¹³⁹ but Georgia was also subjected to a virtual blockade.¹⁴⁰ The attacks created difficulties for the Georgian government to convey messages to its population and in responding to the military invasion¹⁴¹, as the targets were primarily weapons systems¹⁴², information infrastructure and telecommunications, government websites, banks and transportation companies.¹⁴³ It has been noted that no pro-Russia websites were targeted in the attacks.¹⁴⁴\nGeorgia’s reliance on information technology was at the time very limited, leading the cyber attacks to have a relatively low impact.¹⁴⁵ The attacks were considered unsophisticated, but the coordination of them and they coinciding geographically with kinetic operations have raised suspicion that they were part of a larger and thoroughly organised campaign.¹⁴⁶ This belief gained stronger support as it became evident that as the military clashes increased in intensity, so did the cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ The technical forensic deemed the methods used as moderately sophisticated but the use of them as innovative, revealing ‘planning, organisation, target reconnaissance and evolution of attacks’.¹⁴⁸ The DDoS attacks came in two waves, the first carried out by computers remotely overtaken and inserted with malware designed to attack specific targets.

The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.¹⁵⁰\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials.¹⁵¹ xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began¹⁵², and was kept updated continuously.¹⁵³ stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character.¹⁵⁴ It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses¹⁵⁵, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse.¹⁵⁶ The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.¹⁵⁷\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source.¹⁵⁸ Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence.¹⁵⁹ Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial.¹⁶⁰ Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.¹⁶¹\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network.

To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers.¹⁷¹ Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name.¹⁷² Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace.¹⁷³ As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state¹⁷⁴, and in some instances so do the RBN.¹⁷⁵ Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution. There must exist a clear subordinate relationship where the State exercises some form of control or authority.¹⁷⁶ The constellation of the group of individuals must not be based\n¹⁶² Connell M, Vogler S., p. 13\n¹⁶³ Warren P, <https: 15=\"\" 2007=\"\" now=\"\" news.crime=\"\" technology=\"\" www.theguardian.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 17 December 2020’\n¹⁶⁴ Miniats, p. 50\n¹⁶⁵ McDougal, p. 63\n¹⁶⁶ Markoff J, <https: 08=\"\" 13=\"\" 13iht-13cyber.15227999.html=\"\" 2008=\"\" technology=\"\" www.nytimes.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 2 January 2021’\n¹⁶⁷ Tikk, p. 75\n¹⁶⁸ McDougal, p. 63\n¹⁶⁹ ibid, p. 63\n¹⁷⁰ Miniats, p. 50\n¹⁷¹ Klimburg, p. 49\n¹⁷² Atwal, p. 743\n¹⁷³ McDougal, p. 63\n¹⁷⁴ Kadlecova, p. 41\n¹⁷⁵ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁷⁶ Macak, p. 9</https:></https:>\naccording to any legal criteria and may thus even be construed by a de facto basis.¹⁷⁷ This is pertinent to our investigation in regards to whether the persons located in different countries an partaking in the cyber attacks may be considered as a coherent group, by which the state could in theory either exercise control over or delegate elements of governmental authority upon.\nUnder article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility such attribution may be concluded if that person or entity is 'empowered by the law' to 'exercise elements of governmental authority'.¹⁷⁸ There are no evidence of the 'patriotic hackers' to have been employed by an actual contract to perform these cyber attacks, that an army function had been outsourced so to say. Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law.¹⁷⁹ As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities.¹⁸⁰ One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial.¹⁸¹ While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison.¹⁸² This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors¹⁸³, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus.¹⁸⁴ When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as\n¹⁷⁷ ibid, p. 8\n¹⁷⁸ DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26\n¹⁷⁹ Macak, p. 10\n¹⁸⁰ ibid, p. 15\n¹⁸¹ Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50\n¹⁸² Kadlecova, p. 40-41\n¹⁸³ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁸⁴ Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\" en=\"\" government=\"\" government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021'\n21\neither instruction or control. The criteria of the instructions not needing to be detailed, but must be in regards to a particular event and clarify the organisational relationship between the two actors.¹⁸⁵ This is beyond any doubt applicable to such a scenario. One might even argue that the state exercises effective control over the individuals, as they would not be able to continue their cyber activities if not for the state’s involvement holding off the punishment of emprisonment. Depending on the circumstances, the state would have the possibility to be involved and oversee specific operations. This is applicable regardless of whether the individual is acting solo, or as part of the the Nashi group or the Russian Business Network. Since the relationship between Nashi and Russia have already been described in the Estonian case that conclusion will be applied here, and following section will focus on whether Russia can be said to exercise effective control over the RBN and the individual ‘patriotic’ hackers.\nAs mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law.¹⁸⁶ This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.¹⁸⁷\nThe hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded.¹⁸⁸ By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere. Some efforts have been made to mitigate their activities with lack of success.¹⁸⁹ Rather contrary, the law enforcement and judicial\n¹⁸⁵ Macak, p.\n¹⁸⁶ Macak, p.\n¹⁸⁷ Klimburg, p. 47\n¹⁸⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n¹⁸⁹ Klimburg, p. 49\n22\nsystem seem to be working in their favour as no members have not found themselves arrested¹⁹⁰ despite their crimes of distribution of spam, malicious malware and child pornography. Both the GRU and the FSB are known to recruit hackers from this group in particular.¹⁹¹ When it concerns financing and equipping, there are no known facts of such transactions between Russia and the RBN. The Russian Business Networks gets their financing from the services they provide, which includes timely rented botnets.¹⁹² There are also unclarity in regards to whether the RBN have acted on the behalf of the state previously or not, which is important for the facts to be accurately interpreted. While some aspects are not recognised in this case, the higher criterium for effective control are nevertheless met. As previously mentioned these consists of 'planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout' the activity.¹⁹³ The prevailing problem is to conclusively prove that it is specifically Russia acting as such in relation to the RBN.\nThe evidence, consisting primarily of the instructions in the forum, speaks strongly of state-involvement mostly due to the spectacular level of coordination with the military advances.¹⁹⁴ They strongly show the intended will of those responsible for the conduct to be performed.¹⁹⁵ It seems to be a thorough plan of attack by cyber means, ready to set in motion when necessary, clearly demonstrating collaboration of some sort with the Russian state.¹⁹⁶ Otherwise such precision in electing targets which would help facilitate the military invasion as it were in this case, would have been too much of a coincident. Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired.¹⁹⁷ The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged.¹⁹⁸ Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components.¹⁹⁹ While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation.²⁰⁰ The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from. The websites used were based on fake identities and did not reveal an actual perpetrator. However, they\n¹⁹⁰ Klimburg, p. 50\n¹⁹¹ Mshvidobadze K, <https: blogs=\"\" how-to-understand-russia-today=\"\" ukrainealert=\"\" www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 2 January 2021\n¹⁹² Klimburg, p. 49\n¹⁹³ Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112)\n¹⁹⁴ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n¹⁹⁵ Macak, p. 11\n¹⁹⁶ McDougal, p. 63-64\n¹⁹⁷ Blank, p. 89\n¹⁹⁸ ibid, p. 90\n¹⁹⁹ ibid, p. 90\n²⁰⁰ GreyLogic,, p. 20\ncontained a possible lead. The IP address from the corporation providing the hosting services were registered in the United States but physically located in St Petersburg, with their office in the same building as two state institutions and the headquarter of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Russian Armed Forces (GRU) in the area.²⁰¹ This is not strong enough evidence to link the instructions to a state organ, the connection is too far fetch with many open-ended questions. If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity.²⁰² If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.²⁰³ If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.²⁰⁴\nEfforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’.²⁰⁵ While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.²⁰⁶ It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’.²⁰⁷ It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful.²⁰⁸ Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n²⁰¹ GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46\n²⁰² DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40\n²⁰³ DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26\n²⁰⁴ DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38\n²⁰⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n²⁰⁶ DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53\n²⁰⁷ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53\n²⁰⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11\n# Conclusion\nThe phenomenon of states relying on the their nationalistic citizens to perpetuate cyber attacks against foreign adversaries is not likely to perish, but rather to flourish. The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations.\n25\n26"

Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.\nKeywords: state responsibility, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, cyber attack, Russia, hacktivism, Nashi, Russian Business Network, effective control, adoption of act, government authority, Estonia, Georgia, DDoS Introduction 4 Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation 7 Legal Analysis - Attribution 8 Estonia 2007 9 Georgia 2008 18 Conclusion 25 Bibliography 26 # Introduction Conceptions of warfare has evolved in different directions depending on cultures, time eras and advances in technology. The notion of cyber warfare is a prominent example of this. While the West has taken the view of cyber as comprising a whole new domain of warfare that may pose physical security threats, Russia is studying it in another light. The strategists of Russia rather views cyber as a component in information warfare (informatsionoye protivoborstvo in the Russian language), which is to be fully implemented in military campaigns. Accompanied by elements of propaganda, psychological operations and security intelligence, it is clear the view has progressed with influence from strategies of the Soviet time.¹ The attention placed on cyber as a means of warfare derives from a deficiency in economic resources, which has resulted in a quest for other types of power projections that would achieve the political objectives at a manageable cost.² Since Russia inhabits a large demographic of young people that are highly educated but albeit unemployed, the country has a grande pool of the technical resources that are needed to mount larger cyber operations.³ This has enabled Russia to mobilise the entirety of the state sectors to contribute to the national security. The current perception among the political power in Russia appears to be that the country are under an ongoing\"siege\", which is comprised of elements of information warfare. In the eyes of the Russian security strategists there is no hard line between the state of war and peace, but rather a blurring of them taking alternating shapes.⁴ Based on this Russian has taken action to employ these instruments of information warfare globally, with the ambition to achieve subversion of their adversaries without physical force when necessary.⁵ These measures are intended to contribute to the shaping of favourable conditions so if military action is necessary, the 'foundation of victory' has been laid.⁶ By applying this conception of cyber warfare and utilising private hackers Russia has managed to create a buffer between the hostile acts and the state itself, making it difficult to issue reprisals or legal attribution under international law.⁷ The purpose of this thesis is to examine to cases of this phenomenon and conclude on whether the facts of the cases gives rise to the legal responsibility of Russia for the conduct of the private hackers.\nIn order to achieve the purpose of this thesis some more background must be given beforehand. According to the Western stance, cyberspace is the new man-made domain of warfare, comprising the fifth domain additional to the previous four of air, land, sea and space.⁸ It is different from the others in the way it may be utilised to induce harm. While the other domains have co-existed and been the platform for activities, the new domain is the actual means used to execute attacks. In today's modern society nearly all areas in society are dependent upon new technological infrastructure, enabling attacks to have more far reaching and dooming effects. Antagonists may use it to 'compromise, paralyse or even destroy' certain aspects of a foreign society.⁹ Cyber attacks are ¹ Blank S, Cyber War and Information War a la Russe, (2017) p. 81-82 ² ibid, p. 84 ³ McDougal T, Establishing Russia’s Responsibility for Cyber-Crime Based on Its Hacker Culture, (2015), p. 59-60 ⁴ Blank, p. 82-83 ⁵ Blank, p. 93 ⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, Russia’s Approach to Cyber Warfare, (2016), p. 3-4 ⁷ Blank, p. 83 ⁸ Efrony D, The Cyber Domain, Cyber Security and what about International Law? p. 1 ⁹ ibid p. 2 validly considered a national security issue, because of the malicious possibilities it gives to ill-minded individuals.¹⁰ The possible targets are limitless, and can include anything in between a nation’s economy¹¹ and it’s air defence systems and power grids.¹² Even enclosed networks used by military organisations have been targeted.¹³ The effects may destabilize societies, and even debilitate intangible norms and values such as democracy.¹⁴ Under these new circumstances it is the technology of which a state relies on that determines how secure that state is, making industrial states more vulnerable than others.¹⁵ It is not only the damaging effects that entices actors to employ cyber as a means of warfare. From a financial perspective, the costs of executing a cyber attack is significantly less than that of a conventional attack. The materials needed are also easily attained.¹⁶ The unique characteristics of cyberspace plays a great role in the choice as well, especially its geographical boundlessness and anonymity. This cyber-specific ability to retain anonymity in one’s operations creates difficulties in regards to legal attribution, and thus in holding those launching cyber attacks responsible.¹⁷ Non-state actors, such as private hackers, are preferably used by states to perpetrate the attacks in order to limit the possibilities for attribution even further, leaving the option of claiming plausible deniability open for the state.¹⁸ The geographical boundlessness complicates the attribution process further, because it enables a perpetrator to be located in safety while carrying out devastating attacks elsewhere through the interconnected networks.¹⁹ It is therefore a domain of warfare which poses difficult issues for the international legal community, especially in regards to state responsibility.\nThe cyber domain has been viewed as ‘anarchical’ because of the lacking clarity regarding the precise scope of applicable laws.²⁰ The issue of anonymity further strengthens this anarchic notion.²¹ The cyber net has been likened to *‘a big masquerade ball’*²² and *‘The Wild West’*²³, as there are ways to even further mask one’s identity and the actual source of an attack due to the inner ¹⁰ Crootof R, Hathaway O, *The Law of Cyber-Attack*, (2012) p. 817 ¹¹ Efrony, p. 2 ¹² Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 817 ¹³ Whitmore B, <https: 28585339.html=\"\"a=\"\"were-all-russias-neighbors-power-vertical=\"\"www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed 13 December 2020’ ¹⁴ Efrony, p. 2 ¹⁵ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842 ¹⁶ ibid ¹⁷ Efrony, p. 2 ¹⁸ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 843 + 854 ¹⁹ Pascucci P, *Distinction and Proportionality in Cyber War: Virtual Problems with a Real Solution* (2017) p. 428 ²⁰ Schmitt M, Shany Y, *An International Attributional Mechanism for Hostile Cyber Operations?*, (2020) p. 1 ²¹ Efrony, p. 2 ²² Roscini M, *Evidentiary Issues in International Disputes Related to State Responsibility for Cyber Operations*, (2015), p. 234 ²³ Tran D, *The Law of Attribution: Rules for Attribution the Source of a Cyber-Attack*, (2018), p. 384 5</https:> workings of the cyber system.²⁴ These conceptions maintains the idea of the cyber domain being anarchic, leaving it open to escalation and an increase in severity with regards to cyber attacks of the future, and the ways in which they can be employed.²⁵ Consensus have although been reached in acknowledging that international law do apply, leaving the specifics to be a continued issue of debate.²⁶ The slow international progress on the topic is due to limited knowledge about the technical processes, but is also a result of politics. Inexactness and vagueness in the legal discussions about cyberspace and the entailing rules appears to be a deliberate tactic to avoid exposing the state’s own cyber capacity.²⁷ The limited state practice shows that even victim states of cyberattacks abstain from using legal jargong when condemning or justifying countermeasures.²⁸ Instead, when cyberattacks are thought of as state-sponsored, adjectives such as ‘malicious’ or ‘irresponsible’ has been used when condemning attacks. States have refrained from stating exactly which obligations the attacks violate, and are contempt with labelling them as simply ‘violations of international norms’.²⁹ It is the present behaviour of states that will shape future regulation in both legal and normative forms, and therefore it lays in the best interest of the international community to not allow impunity but rather the opposite, to nourish norms of appropriate behaviour.³⁰ The legal framework of state responsibility encompasses two distinct steps necessary for it to be invoked. The first step is to identify the obligation in breach, and the next to establish an attributional link in order to connect the breach to the state in question. The architecture of the cyber space complicates this latter attempt.³¹ The Internet works by data transmission. Every computer is assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) number automatically, which has the same function as an ‘address’. When being active on the Internet, the computer uses the IP to send chunks of data through the overall network while finding their way to the final destination where the chunks are then read for their request, and sent back in a similar manner with the accompanied information requested.³² However, not all such processes will necessitate the source to be known resulting in not knowing where an attack originated. There are also several tools for masking the true IP address. Simple ways are by using proxy servers or using a fake return IP address.³³ Ultimately, the greatest issue for legal attribution is that even with a correct IP address one can only identify the computer source and not ascertain whether a specific individual initiated the attack. This is evidently complicated in situations where a hacker compromises another person’s computer and uses it to perpetrate attacks, or when public service devices or networks are being exploited.³⁴ The former scenario is common as it is a necessary component of launching simple Distributed Denial of ²⁴ Roscini, p 234 ²⁵ Tran, p 384 ²⁶ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 2 ²⁷ Efrony, p. 2-3 ²⁸ Shany and Schmitt, p. 2 ²⁹ Finnemore M, Hollis B, Beyond Naming and Shaming: Accusations and International Law in Cybersecurity (2020) 4 ³⁰ Tran, p. 382 ³¹ ibid, p. 387 ³² ibid, p. 388 ³³ ibid, p. 389 ³⁴ ibid, p. 390 Service (DDoS) attacks. The logic behind it, is that it takes an incredible amount of data to overwhelm a system to cause it to malfunction and by using private persons’s computers remotely gives the hacker the appropriate quantity of data. It will also help the attacker to evade attribution and responsibility, since it will create electronic trails from all over the world and thus lead astray any potential technical forensic.³⁵ ## Legal Analysis - Breach of Obligation In 1927 the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) asserted in the Lotus Case the foundational principles of state responsibility. The Court acknowledged that legal responsibility for states arise when they are in breach of their international obligations and that this breach entails consequences.³⁶ This is the general principle underlying the legal framework of state responsibility. The precise nature of the legal process was further developed by the International Law Commission resulting in the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in 2001 (furthermore referenced as the ILC’s articles).³⁷ The principle is codified in article 1 of this document. Following articles concerns what an internationally wrongful act is and how the responsibility will be determined. The process of establishing state responsibility is twofold; the first step identifies the obligation in breach and the second investigates the attributional link between the act or omission and the state in question.³⁸ This thesis main focus is the second step, however, the next section will briefly clarify what international obligations gives cyber attacks their unlawful status.\nCyber attacks unlawfulness are found in both conventional and customary international law.³⁹ The Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States, was adopted in 2001 and codified the customary status of the principle of non-intervention. The document is primarily focused on prohibiting interventions by military might, but also stipulates “all other forms of interference” and “any other type of measures to coerce another State”, which allows for an inclusive interpretation.⁴⁰ The essence of the non-intervention principle purports to force states to abstain from interfering with the internal business of other states,⁴¹ as they are sovereign entities. This principle is one of two general legal principles that govern cyber attacks.⁴² The second principle is located in the Charter of the United Nations in the well-renowned article 2(4), the prohibition on the use of force. Article 2(4) stipulates that states should eschew from ‘the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state’.⁴³ ³⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 9-10 ³⁶ France v Turkey (the Lotus Case), PCIJ, 1927, PCIJ Reports, series A, No. 10.\n³⁷ International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, November 2001, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10) p. 1 ³⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 10 ³⁹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 841-842 ⁴⁰ Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United States of the UNGA Res. 2625 (XXV) (1970), p. 7 ⁴¹ Crootof R, Hathaway O, p. 842 ⁴² ibid, p. 841 ⁴³ UN Charter, art. 2(4) Drawing on the advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case (1996), cyber attacks constitute a use of force as the article 2(4) was clarified by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to apply in relation to 'any use of force, regardless of the weapons deployed'.44 Depending on it's scale and effect, a cyber attack might go beyond the use of force and reach the level of an armed attack, giving rise to the state's right to self-defence under article 51 of the UN Charter.45 With the enlightenment of this premise, the thesis will move into the analysis of the cases under the Law on State Responsibility.\n## Legal Analysis - Attribution Article 2 in the ILC's articles contains the elements of an internationally wrongful act. Whether the violative conduct is an act or an omission, it has to be attributed to the state in question through the ways enlisted in the document's subsequent articles.46 As a general principle, the conduct of private persons does not invoke the responsibility of the state.47 Consequently, breaches committed/omitted by state organs are those that will give rise to state responsibility.48 The phenomenon examined in this thesis revolves around private persons being utilised in operations so to enable the state actor to claim plausible deniability, meaning that those perpetuating the cyber attacks are not traditional state organs. Therefore, the following analysis will investigate whether the circumstances in each of the cases may fall under either article 5 (exercising governmental authority), article 8 (acting under instruction, direction or control) or article 11 (acknowledgement and adoption of act as one's own) of the ILC's articles. Article 4 which encompasses state organs will also be briefly applied in instances where the facts necessitate. The thesis will study the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008, in respective order.\nThe analysis will manifest firstly by a description of the cases, the identification of possible perpetrators of the cyber attacks, and then examination of these facts through the lens of the law on state responsibility. Quoted here are the specific articles from the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts by which the analysis will emanate: ## Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n\n## Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n## Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by a State The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\n## Article 11. Conduct acknowledged and adopted by a State as its own Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.⁴⁹ ## Estonia 2007 During a period between April and May in 2007, Estonia was the target of multiple Distributed Denial of Service cyber attacks (DDoS).⁵⁰ A country which had heavily integrated information technology into the daily life of their citizens and even government, which worked basically 'paperless'.⁵¹ The attacks are believed to have been prompted by the Estonian decision to transfer a World War II statute from the centra of Tallinn to a more remote place outside the city.⁵² The statute commemorated the death of Soviet soldiers during the war, but constituted a painful reminder of soviet occupation for the Estonians. The relocation was motivated as part of a larger policy process of minimizing the influence of Russian culture in Estonia, to strengthen national identity.⁵³ Both Russia and ethnic Russians living in Estonia were angered by the decision, as it was perceived as one of many injustices towards the minority in the country. Kremlin even alleged that Estonia would\"pay the consequences of the displacement\". Shortly after the relocation, protests by the Russian minority in Estonia erupted and evolved into riots, called the 'Bronze Night' unrests.⁵⁴ The cyber attacks against Estonia coincided with these riots, and extended only for the period the unrest lasted.⁵⁵ The targets of the DDoS attacks were the country's largest banks, news- and telecommunication facilities as well as websites of the Estonian government and various political parties.⁵⁶ The ⁴⁹ DARSIWA, p. 26 ⁵⁰ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 9 ⁵¹ ibid, p. 10 ⁵² ibid, p. 10-11 ⁵³ Herzog S, Revisiting the Estonian Cyber Attacks: Digital Threats and Multinational Responses, (2011), p. 50 ⁵⁴ Miniats M, War of Nerves: Russia's Use of Cyber Warfare in Estonia, Georgia and Ukraine, (2019), p. 36 ⁵⁵ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 10-11 ⁵⁶ ibid, p. 10 selection of targets appears to have been strategic, since the damaging effects of the attacks brought the services of the society to a halt. The cyber attacks also made the country unable to communicate with the outside world.57 Additionally, the chosen targets are indicative of the perpetrators having inside information regarding what systems to give proper attention to, as those selected constituted intrinsically important parts of the networks.58 The indications of the scope of the perpetrators knowledge is further strengthen by the fact that instructions regarding both targets and the practicalities of launching the attacks were posted in advance in Russian online forums.59 The attacks launched at the targets came in several waves, were the latter ones showed sign of sophistication.60 The technical forensic analysis conducted afterwards showed that approximately 1 million computers were used for the attacks, emanating from more than 75 different jurisdictions. In the peak of the attacks more than 20 000 compromised computers were linked to partake in the ongoing malicious activity61, with botnets from countries in different ends of the world.62 There were efforts from the Estonian side to counter the cyber attacks by denying external servers access and expanding throughput capacity so as to release the pressures on the websites and be able to communicate messages to the public.63 These countermeasures were met with adaptation from the attackers side,64 as they sent ping messages to measure the throughput capacity and organise their attacks accordingly.65 They also received information on how to maintain their attacks despite the new defences. To the forensic analysts, this shows evidence of the attackers being 'a well-organised group with features of command and control', something which demands high levels of knowledge and financial means.66 The sophistication, organisational features and generated effects have led to the belief that these cyber attacks were part of an a large campaign organised by Russia.67 Circumstantial evidence such as the recently fuming diplomatic tension and coinciding timing of the attacks alludes to the responsibility of the Russian state as well.68 Russia have consistently denied any involvement in the issue69, but the perception of the country's guilt is still widespread. However, no conclusive evidence have insofar been unearthed to ascertain 10</https:></https:> direct state involvement.70 Instead, nationalistic hackers appear to have been the direct aggressor. Dmitri Galushkevich, an IT-student from Tallinn with Russian ethnicity, self-claimed responsibility through boasting about his capabilities for executing DDoS attacks against an Estonian political party's website, constituting part of the cyber attacks.71 He is the only individual until this day prosecuted for the unlawful cyber attacks.72 Albeit not having stood trial, the international attention has been placed on the russian Nashi Youth Group (наши, meaning 'Ours') due to implications of their involvement in the cyber attacks.73 Konstantin Goloskokov, one of the group's\"commissar\"74, actually admitted in 2009 to have been responsible for the cyber attacks along with some of his 'associates', insinuating the group being responsible for the events.73 Although, according to another interview of his, he claims the cyber attacks was his own initiative, executed without help from neither the Russian state or Nashi.76 The bewilderment continues to grow as Sergei Markov, member of the Russian Duma, acknowledged in a panel discussion that the attack was a\"reaction from civil society\"and at the same time\"was carried out by my assistant. I won't tell you his name...\".77 Markov's assistant was later revealed to be Konstantin Goloskokov.78 Moving along in the analysis, the assumption will be made that the Nashi group were the perpetrators of the attack, and the thesis will investigate whether their relationship with Russia may give reason to attribute the conduct to the state.\nThe revelation regarding Markov's assistant naturally leads the analysis into article 4 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 4 concerns a formal and automatic attributional link in instances where state organs have conducted an act constituting wrongfulness. Accordingly, a state organ may exist on basis of either de jure under article 4(1) or de facto under 4(2). Any person\"whatever position it holds in the organisation of the State\"is considered a de jure state organ by which it's conduct will be directly attributed to the state. It can be argued that the works of Goloskokov alone would suffice to attribute the conduct to the Russian state, based on his profession as assistant to a Duma Deputy, since the Duma is a central part of the legislative branch of the Russian Federation.79 However, the Commentary to the ILC articles further clarifies that the state organ in question must have been 'acting in that capacity'.80 This has been asserted in international case law as well, earliest in the Salvador Commercial Company case where the judgement concluded that acts 'of its rulers' will be attributed to the State 'so far as the acts are 11</https:></https:></https:></https:> done in their official capacity'.81 Whether Goloskokov acted in his official capacity can from the evidence gathered not be determined as the information is insufficient in shining a light on this aspect. The conclusion leans towards him acting privately, based on his possibly true claims of having used his personal computer in his free time and thus acting on his own initiative as a private person. There are also some debate as to the authenticity of both his and Markov’s statements creating even more uncertainty.82 Responsibility through attribution under article 4(1) will therefore be dismissed.\nWith the dismissal of article 4(1) the next step is to examine whether Goloskokov’s Nashi-group might be considered a de facto state organ under article 4(2). The commentary clearly notes that the internal law of a state is not enough to determine the status of state organ, as this can create situations where states evades what clearly are their responsibility due to a technicality. Instead, *the powers of an entity and its relations to other bodies under internal law* will help assist with the determination.83 In the case of Nashi and the relation to Russia it is clear that the group has no formal powers conferred upon them from the state, even though there are examples of their activities being utilised for the sake of the state.84 Alongside this, the article itself is silent on the issue of the required level of control for attribution. This has led the ICJ to identify a threshold of what is necessary for classifying organisations as de facto state organs, namely ‘the complete dependence test’.85 This test and its customary law status has been reaffirmed in the Bosnian Genocide case as well.86 The ‘complete dependence test’ gives a selection of factors to consider:87 i. whether the non-state entity was created by the state ii. whether state involvement exceeded the provision of training and financial assistance iii. whether complete control was exercised in fact iv. whether the state selected, installed or paid the political leaders of the group The first question gains an affirmative; the Nashi youth group was established by the state, specifically by the ideological state chief Vladislav Surkov. He created the group for two purposes. To counter a growing Nazi-ideology in the nation and to aide Russia in avoiding revolutions instigated by the youth which had been seen in neighbouring countries.88 In regards to the last question, the group has had former Commissar’s ending up in government positions after their engagement but not the other way around.89 Therefore the question is answered in the negative, and so are the rest of them as well. Implications from this are that Nashi fail the ‘complete dependence test’ and are not to be considered de facto state organs. Links of attribution will therefore need to be sought after by the remaining articles of 5, 8 or 11.\n\nThe next step of the analysis will examine the case of Estonia under the light of Article 8, concerned with situations in which non-state actors acts on a state's behalf.⁹⁵ Included in the provision are three disjunctive ways through which the conduct can be attributed to the state, establishing one of these attributional links is sufficient for legal responsibility to arise. These consists of the conduct being the result of an 'instruction', 'direction, or 'control'.⁹⁶ Beginning with 'instruction', for the conduct to fall under this part it is necessary to seek the existence of an instruction in which the conduct requested is present. This could be expressed in great detail or vaguely, as long as the instructions 'manifest the will of the State to authorise the unlawful conduct'.⁹⁷ A prominent feature of the cyber attacks on Estonia were the online hacker forums in which actual instructions were posted beforehand, alongside lists of targets and downloadable malware.⁹⁸ The instructions were precise in how to conduct ping attacks against Estonian websites⁹⁹, clearly manifesting the will to perpetrate what must have been known as an ⁹⁰ Tallinn Manual 2.0, p. 106 ⁹¹ DARSIWA, ART. 5, COMMENTARY (6), P. 43 ⁹² Heickerö R, FOI, p.\n⁹³ DARSIWA, ILC Commentary, art. 5, §6) ⁹⁴ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 38 ⁹⁵ DARSIWA, p. 26 article 8 ⁹⁶ DARSIWA, ILC commentary, art 8, §7, p. 48 ⁹⁷ Macak K, Decoding Article 8 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Attribution of Cyber Operations by Non-State Actors, (2016), p. 11 ⁹⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 10 ⁹⁹ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\"2007=\"\"ff-estonia=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 27 December 2020' Continuing, the article concerned with control requires a subordinate relationship between the non-state actor and the state and this would be achieved through the accepting of the instructions given. The need for such a relationship hierarchy lies in the particular scenario envisaged for article 8 to capture, namely a group existing 'outside the official State structure' while simultaneously carry out tasks for the state.¹⁰³ These instructions must also have been given 'in respect of each operation in which the alleged violations occurred', based on the judgement in the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁴ So-called 'rallying calls' of those likeminded won't suffice as an instruction, based on the case law from the Bosnian Genocide case.¹⁰⁵ The instructions posted before the Estonian cyber attacks included such 'rallying calls'¹⁰⁶, and would therefore not be accounted for as specified instructions resulting in a subordinate structure of actors were not included in the instructions. Evidently from previous relations, the Nashi Youth group and the Russian state share similar ideological and political goals. However, sharing of goals is not enough of a basis to establish attribution under article 8 and 'instructions'.¹⁰⁷ The instructions posted online might otherwise have sufficed, as they contained the selection of targets, including the means, and may therefore be said to have authorised each and every one of those cyber attacks directed at those specific targets. Although, still dependent upon the identify of the one who posted the instructions on the website.\nThere are differences in scholarly interpretations in regards to the wording of 'direction or control of', whether they are to be read synonymous and in conjunction or as representing two separate concepts.¹⁰⁸ Would the attribution be tried under 'direction' alone it would be crucial to prove the ¹⁰⁰ DARSIWA, Chapter II, Commentary (2), p. 38 ¹⁰¹ DARSIWA, article 7, p. 26 ¹⁰² Macak, p. 11 ¹⁰³ ibid, p. 9 ¹⁰⁴ Bosnian Genocide (n15) (400) ¹⁰⁵ Macak, p. 9 ¹⁰⁶ Davis J, <http: 08=\"\"2007=\"\"ff-estonia=\"\"ff-estonia=\"\"www.wired.com=\"\"> 'accessed 28 December 2020' ¹⁰⁷ Macak, p. 9-10 ¹⁰⁸ ibid, p. 6 14</http:> existence of a continuous hierarchical relationship in which loose directions had been given and the group progressively worked towards.¹⁰⁹ This is not applicable to this case, and the analysis will therefore treat the wording in conjunction, under ‘direction or control of’.\nThe legacy of the Nicaragua case is the formulation by the ICJ of the ‘effective control test’, which is the prevalent test to determine whether a state’s control over an individual or groups of individuals may give the conduct of said non-state actors an attributional link to the state, making the conduct it’s legal responsibility.¹¹⁰ Supporting a non-state actor in the form of ‘financing, organising, training, supplying or equipping’ might constitute another act of wrongful conduct for the State, as this have been determined in the Nicaragua case to violate the non-intervention principle. Nevertheless, support of this kind are not enough for the State to be considered as having effective control.¹¹¹ The rumours of the Nashi Youth Group being financially state-sponsored are therefore not solely sufficient in attributing the conduct of the group to Russia.¹¹² The control that is necessary to reach the ‘effective control’ criteria requires the state to have a part in ‘planning the operations, choosing the targets, and provision of operational support throughout’ the activity.¹¹³ The facts of this case disclose that such circumstances were prevalent. An investigation into the matter by Estonian authorities revealed that the cyber attacks were discussed and planned, in the Russian language, several days before the actual day of launching.¹¹⁴ The forum also contained detailed instructions about what websites and networks to target, some of which were especially important and ‘mission-critical’. These facts strongly indicates that either the perpetrators had special insight into the functionings of the networks, something which no ordinary citizen would have acquired knowledge of.¹¹⁵ Of note regarding the hacker’s insights, were the Estonian remark on the adaptiveness of the hackers when their efforts to counter the attacks did not effectively stop the cyber attacks. Instead, it has been acknowledged that the hackers were given guidance on how to continue their attacks in tandem with the Estonian countermoves.¹¹⁶ This would without doubt measure up to have been provision of operational support throughout the activity, with the implication of seemingly exercised effective control by the state.\nIt is decisive that the state is the actor exercising this effective control.¹¹⁷ Otherwise, the conduct constituting a wrongful act would not be the attributed to the State but merely be the criminal responsibility of those private persons. This is where the evidence fail to incriminate the Russian state. Despite the circumstances mentioned above and prior connections between Russia and Nashi, there are no truly concrete evidence revealing a state organ to have been behind the Estonian cyber ¹⁰⁹ Macak, p. 12 ¹¹⁰ ibid, p. 14 ¹¹¹ ibid, p. 14-15, citing Nicaragua (n 35) (115) ¹¹² Kadlecova, p. 41 ¹¹³ Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112) ¹¹⁴ Blank, p. 85-86 ¹¹⁵ Heickerö R, FOI,, p. 40 ¹¹⁶ Heickerö R, FOI, p. 41 ¹¹⁷ Nicaragua (Merits), ICJ Reports 1986, 14 at 64, para. 115 attacks.¹¹⁸ And less so to have been behind the given instructions, part of the planning or as the one providing continuous support throughout the cyber attacks. What have been established is rather that the specific features of the cases do display a high probability of state-involvement as the resources necessary amounts to those of a state¹¹⁹, but going further than that and actually tying a specific state to these cyber attacks are at this time not possible. This is complicated further by the fact that the Nashi group has growingly become more autonomous from the Russian state, making it more unlikely that the state could have exercised effective control over the group.¹²⁰ The International Law Commission included an article in the document on State Responsibility under which attribution could be established in scenarios where the state retrospectively approved of the wrongful conduct by non-state actors. This is article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.¹²¹ The elements of this provision concerns the phrases 'to the extent' and 'acknowledges and adopts... as its own'. The choice of word for 'to the extent' has the purpose of recognising the idea that a state may not adopt the conduct wholly but only some of it.¹²² The second element of the provision has the intention of creating a distinction between instances of true adoption and those 'of mere support or endorsement'.¹²³ The act of adoption may be either vocally or inferred by state conduct, but must be 'clear and unequivocal'.¹²⁴ Whichever way, the determination of such adoption would take note of several instances where such intention had been expressed, as the legal framework permits a cumulative process.¹²⁵ The facts of the Estonia case shows that Russia denied any involvement in the cyber attacks, eliminating a vital factor for possible attribution, yet they encouraged the hackers unlawful activity.¹²⁶ Two years later Markov, the state duma deputy, even acknowledged that such events\"will happen more and more\".¹²⁷ It might be farfetched to interpret this as willingness to perpetuate such occurrences in the future, but it do indicate at least a passive approach towards cyber attacks launched from allegedly Russian territory. This creates concerns in the legal analysis, as it is necessary for the statement to express intention of taking responsibility, which evidently is not seen here.¹²⁸ Drawing from case law, the encouragement aimed towards the hackers appears insufficient in constituting acknowledgment and adoption of conduct as one's own. The bar for this is quite high, based on the Tehran Hostage Case. The case concerned the conduct of private persons of which the Iranian state subsequently approved of and claimed as their own. The ICJ reasoned as following in the case:\"The approval given to these facts by the Ayatollah Khomeini and other ¹¹⁸ Miniats, p. 39 ¹¹⁹ Atwal M, Evaluating Nashi’s Sustainability: Autonomy, Agency and Activism, (2009), p. 40 ¹²⁰ ibid, p.\n¹²¹ DARSIWA, article 11, p. 52 ¹²² DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53 ¹²³ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53 ¹²⁴ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (8), p. 53 ¹²⁵ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (9), p. 53 ¹²⁶ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12 ¹²⁷ Coalson R, <https: 1505613.html=\"\"a=\"\"behind_the_estonia_cyberattacks=\"\"www.rferl.org=\"\"> ‘accessed’ 29 December 2020’ ¹²⁸ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53 16</https:> organs of the Iranian State, and the decision to perpetuate them...” caused a change in the legal character of the events, giving rise to Iranian responsibility.¹²⁹ Also relevant from the Tehran Case was a statement given by a state organ that was taken into account by the ICJ. The state organ stated that the acts of the private persons “had been done by our nation”¹³⁰, with emphasis on the word “our”. Such intention has not been seen in the case of Estonia and alleged Russian involvement. The closest of such a statement we have from Russia is Vladislav Surkov, at the time with the title of First Deputy Chief of the Presidential Staff, publicly announced the intention of utilising Nashi’s technological knowledge to ‘to enhance the will of Kremlin in Russian Cyberspace’.¹³¹ He clearly acknowledges the existence of a relationship between the State and the youth group, in which the Nashi activists can be ‘employed’ to perpetuate the Russian wishes. Even though Surkov explicitly mentions Russian cyberspace, it might be unjustified to assume he is referring to the cyberspace enabling connection between Russia and Estonia. More likely, Surkov is referring to the domestic cyberspace and activity within that domain. The case for interpreting the statement as Nashi acting on behalf of the Russian state, resulting in state responsibility for their conduct, might be made, nonetheless the statement were made in prospective terms referring to situations not yet occurred. So while attesting to the suspicions of entanglement, it is not enough for attribution under article 11 as retrospective adoption. To conclude, Russia can not be said to have vocally expressed intention of adoption and taking responsibility.\nThe last part of this analysis is to examine whether such intention may be inferred from Russian conduct during and after the cyber attacks actualisation. What has further strengthened the allegations against Russia is their passivity in regards to providing investigative help based on the suspicion of Russian-based persons involvement in the cyber attacks against Estonia. The two countries had at the time a bilateral agreement in force since way back, with the object of assisting each other with criminal investigation transcending national boarders. Encompassed in this agreement were provisions for procedural acts, listed non-exhaustively. The Estonian authorities invoked the agreement as they needed information on persons located in Russia, gathered from the online forums in which the planning of the cyber attacks took place. Their request concerned the identification of these persons. Russia denied the request on basis that it was not covered by the agreement, although similar requests had been accepted previously.¹³² This would indicate an unwillingness on the behalf of Russia to uphold their commitment to cooperate in the investigations concerned with persons located within their jurisdiction, and even go as far as protecting said persons from prosecution. Examples of similar nature are found in Russian history. Former KGB Colonel Oleg Gordievsky enlightened the international community in 1998 about the Russian state’s tendency to alleviate criminal charges against hackers if they employed their actions to benefit the Russian FSB.¹³³ While being to old examples to account in this legal analysis, they do confess to a pattern of behaviour. Unfortunately, this seemingly guilty behaviour has been found insufficient for attributing the conduct to the state.¹³⁴ ¹²⁹ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35 ¹³⁰ Tehran Hostages case, ICJ Reports 1980, 3 at 35 ¹³¹ Kadlecova, p. 41 ¹³² Tikk, p. 27 ¹³³ Kadlecova, p. 40-41 ¹³⁴ Schmitt M, Vihul L, Proxy Wars in Cyberspace, (2014) p. 64\n\n# Georgia 2008\nAfter a long history of icy relations between Georgia and Russia, the latter began a military invasion on the 8th of August in 2008 against Georgian territory.¹³⁵ The background of the conflict relates to Georgia’s efforts to decrease their dependency on Russia. A relevant example is that a large portion of Georgian telecommunications infrastructure ran through Russia at the time, and efforts were made to reroute these to Bulgaria instead.¹³⁶ Another important factor in the conflict were concerned with the issue of recognition of political independence for the South Ossetian region. There were separate political views and interests involved, as the area itself were politically more aligned with Russia but physically present inside Georgian boarders.¹³⁷\nA new way of exploiting cyber space revealed itself in relation to the military actions, as it was coincided with and supported by offensive and pre-planned cyber attacks.¹³⁸ The cyber attacks consisted mainly of damaging DDoS-attacks¹³⁹ but Georgia was also subjected to a virtual blockade.¹⁴⁰ The attacks created difficulties for the Georgian government to convey messages to its population and in responding to the military invasion¹⁴¹, as the targets were primarily weapons systems¹⁴², information infrastructure and telecommunications, government websites, banks and transportation companies.¹⁴³ It has been noted that no pro-Russia websites were targeted in the attacks.¹⁴⁴\nGeorgia’s reliance on information technology was at the time very limited, leading the cyber attacks to have a relatively low impact.¹⁴⁵ The attacks were considered unsophisticated, but the coordination of them and they coinciding geographically with kinetic operations have raised suspicion that they were part of a larger and thoroughly organised campaign.¹⁴⁶ This belief gained stronger support as it became evident that as the military clashes increased in intensity, so did the cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ The technical forensic deemed the methods used as moderately sophisticated but the use of them as innovative, revealing ‘planning, organisation, target reconnaissance and evolution of attacks’.¹⁴⁸ The DDoS attacks came in two waves, the first carried out by computers remotely overtaken and inserted with malware designed to attack specific targets. The second wave\n¹³⁵ Connell M, Vogler S., p. 12\n¹³⁶ Miniats, p. 45\n¹³⁷ ibid, p. 43\n¹³⁸ Heickerö R, FOI., p. 43\n¹³⁹ Miniats, p. 48\n¹⁴⁰ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n¹⁴¹ Heickerö R, FOI., p. 46-47\n¹⁴² Blank, p. 88\n¹⁴³ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 12\n¹⁴⁴ Miniats, p. 49\n¹⁴⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13\n¹⁴⁶ ibid, p. 13\n¹⁴⁷ Heickerö R, FOI., p. 44\n¹⁴⁸ ibid, p. 46\ncame from a command and control server¹⁴⁹ which originated from the United States of America. The server had been set up two weeks prior to the conflict.¹⁵⁰\nRussian hacktivists websites were used to execute these attacks. They provided the targets, instructions, downloadable malware and even after-action assessments materials.¹⁵¹ xaker.ru was an already prominent website, but stopgeorgia.ru came online and it's information were available as little as only a few hours before the military invasion began¹⁵², and was kept updated continuously.¹⁵³ stopgeorgia.ru were protected by password. Both websites were further equipped with so called bulletproof networks, meaning that the users activities were not limited to be of benign character.¹⁵⁴ It is of particular significance that the targets included had already been vetted beforehand, which practically meant that reconnaissance had been made prior to determine whether the targets could be accessed from Russian IP addresses¹⁵⁵, eliminating any suspicion that this was an act of impulse.¹⁵⁶ The Georgian response to the cyber attacks consisted of blocking IP addresses located in Russia and rerouting it's traffic through Estonia, Poland and the United States. Georgia also received expert personnel from Estonia to help with countering the attacks.¹⁵⁷\nIt is beyond doubt that Russia bear the responsibility for the military invasion, but the issue of who is responsible for the cyber attacks is a more hazy issue to clarify. As always with cyber, the technical issue of attribution is difficult as there are multiple ways of hiding the original source.¹⁵⁸ Many fingers have pointed towards Russia, who has denied it's involvement and whose argument may rest on the lack of conclusive evidence.¹⁵⁹ Networks used for launching some of the DDoS-attacks had IP addresses connected to Russian-owned companies, indicating involvement. However, this fact has been heavily argued as the networks might have been hacked and thus not used by the state-owned companies themselves. This evidence is considered as mere circumstantial.¹⁶⁰ Even if true, it would prima facie not be attributed to the state unless the conduct could fall under article 5 or the state clearly exploited it's position to exert control over the company's resources.¹⁶¹\nThose believed to have directly, albeit in different ways, partaken in the cyber attacks are three discerned actors; 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi and the Russian Business Network.

To begin with, the RBN is a business corporation working on a global scale but consists of young and knowledgeable hackers.¹⁷¹ Secondly, the Nashi Youth Group is a smaller root-grass organisation comprised of the same demography, made clear by its name.¹⁷² Individuals who share the political goals and visions as the politicians in Russia have also partaken in the cyber attacks, and have had the means to do so even while being located outside of the involved countries thanks to the characteristics of cyberspace.¹⁷³ As Nashi was created as a means to secure the political status quo the organisation do hold similar goals to the Russian state¹⁷⁴, and in some instances so do the RBN.¹⁷⁵ Unfortunately, international law demands more than a non-state actor having the same political goal as the state for establishing attribution. There must exist a clear subordinate relationship where the State exercises some form of control or authority.¹⁷⁶ The constellation of the group of individuals must not be based ¹⁶² Connell M, Vogler S., p. 13 ¹⁶³ Warren P, <https: 15=\"\"2007=\"\"now=\"\"news.crime=\"\"technology=\"\"www.theguardian.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 17 December 2020’ ¹⁶⁴ Miniats, p. 50 ¹⁶⁵ McDougal, p. 63 ¹⁶⁶ Markoff J, <https: 08=\"\"13=\"\"13iht-13cyber.15227999.html=\"\"2008=\"\"technology=\"\"www.nytimes.com=\"\"> ‘accessed 2 January 2021’ ¹⁶⁷ Tikk, p. 75 ¹⁶⁸ McDougal, p. 63 ¹⁶⁹ ibid, p. 63 ¹⁷⁰ Miniats, p. 50 ¹⁷¹ Klimburg, p. 49 ¹⁷² Atwal, p. 743 ¹⁷³ McDougal, p. 63 ¹⁷⁴ Kadlecova, p. 41 ¹⁷⁵ Klimburg, p. 50 ¹⁷⁶ Macak, p. 9</https:></https:> according to any legal criteria and may thus even be construed by a de facto basis.¹⁷⁷ This is pertinent to our investigation in regards to whether the persons located in different countries an partaking in the cyber attacks may be considered as a coherent group, by which the state could in theory either exercise control over or delegate elements of governmental authority upon.\nUnder article 5 of the Articles on State Responsibility such attribution may be concluded if that person or entity is 'empowered by the law' to 'exercise elements of governmental authority'.¹⁷⁸ There are no evidence of the 'patriotic hackers' to have been employed by an actual contract to perform these cyber attacks, that an army function had been outsourced so to say. Instead, the hacktivists were rallied and appeal was made to their nationalistic ideas. The limited act of incitement of cyber crimes are not regulated by international law.¹⁷⁹ As discussed in the previous case regarding the Estonia cyber attacks, the relationship with Nashi and the Russian state is a special one. Although, not one of empowerment as the law describes.\nLacking evidence neither the RBN can be said to be in such a relationship of empowerment. It has become clear over the years that the Russian Business Network enjoys treatment beyond the ordinary from the Russian authorities.¹⁸⁰ One plausible explanation is believed to be a possible family connection through the leader of the RBN and an influential politician in Russia. Despite the many accusations against the corporation, those active in the RBN have never been arrested and subject to the risk of standing trial.¹⁸¹ While this is a connection to the internal law regulations it would be a mistake to interpret this as a situation in which Russia have empowered the RBN to perform cyber crimes, as a specified act of governmental authority. This is rather an indication of the state exercising control over the members of the group.\nAs mentioned above, it has been public knowledge since 1998 that good hackers in Russia sometimes are given a choice when convicted, which includes the possibility to work for the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to avoid spending the penalty time in prison.¹⁸² This in conjunction with the fact that hackers, included those outside of the RBN, even have had their charges dropped by regular courts, testify to a level of tolerance to these types of offences. A representative of a FSB office has even stated that those performing cyber attacks against the West in earlier years were 'worthy of respect'. Former convicts have also resurfaced as government advisors¹⁸³, perpetuating the allegations of close connections between the state and the national hacker community. One might argue that this shows indications of certain control, the issue is to determine to what level such control arises.\nWould the scenario be that of employment into the FSB it would be a clearcut example of formal attribution, as the hackers would constitute official state organs since the FSB is an executive part of the Russian state apparatus.¹⁸⁴ When concerned with cases where the threat has been made, to either perform tasks for the Russian government or to face charges, the issue might fall under article 8 as ¹⁷⁷ ibid, p. 8 ¹⁷⁸ DARSIWA, art. 5, p. 26 ¹⁷⁹ Macak, p. 10 ¹⁸⁰ ibid, p. 15 ¹⁸¹ Klimburg A, Mobilising Cyber Power, (2011), p. 50 ¹⁸² Kadlecova, p. 40-41 ¹⁸³ Klimburg, p. 50 ¹⁸⁴ Russian Government, <http: 113=\"\"en=\"\"government=\"\"government.ru=\"\"></http:> 'accessed 1 January 2021' As mentioned earlier the hacktivists were acting through the instructions posted on the respective websites and as indicated did not belong to a coherent and common group, such as the RBN or Nashi. The question therefore arises if they could be said to have been a group in that sense. According to an interpretation of a legal scholar, whether the group draws it’s existence from a legal or de facto basis is ‘immaterial’ in the eyes of the law.¹⁸⁶ This interpretation is especially important in the context of cyber attacks, evident by this particular case where hackers unknown of each others identities can be mobilised and executing synchronized cyber attacks with great effect. The hackers launching attacks in the cyber domain differs in terms of professions and group constellation, which is important to take note of. Military units, university IT departments as well as private persons are all examples from reality of what current perpetrators of cyber attacks looks like, and they all fall under this scope of the law. The law have thus managed to capture a phenomenon before it’s time.¹⁸⁷ The hacktivists partook as a ‘national duty’ to help their motherland, and drawn from lack of sources stating otherwise they received no financial or technical means for ensured capability to conduct the attacks as requested or as payment afterwards. Although, malware used for the attacks were provided in the instructions and easily downloaded.¹⁸⁸ By the case description it is clear that whoever posted the instructions and led the discussion in the forum had a big influence of the actions of the hacktivists. Whether or not that person could have terminated the mission prematurely and deterred the ‘patriots’ from continuing is uncertain. Experts in the area have warned that while proxies such as these hackers gives an enjoyable distance to the unlawful conduct, they are individuals without much holding them from ‘going rouge’ and doing acts beyond the scope of their instructions. The cyberdomain therefore is truly distinct from the physical realm, in which control is exercised more easily. To conclude, the facts point towards the exercise of effective control despite some uncertainties. However, attribution can not be concluded as the issue of who the giver of instructions is still unsolved.\nThere are some connections between the Russian Business Network and the law enforcement in Russia. As described above, the members of the RBN have continuously been tolerated and allowed to perform their services within the Russian cyber crime sphere. Some efforts have been made to mitigate their activities with lack of success.¹⁸⁹ Rather contrary, the law enforcement and judicial ¹⁸⁵ Macak, p.\n¹⁸⁶ Macak, p.\n¹⁸⁷ Klimburg, p. 47 ¹⁸⁸ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13 ¹⁸⁹ Klimburg, p. 49 The evidence, consisting primarily of the instructions in the forum, speaks strongly of state-involvement mostly due to the spectacular level of coordination with the military advances.¹⁹⁴ They strongly show the intended will of those responsible for the conduct to be performed.¹⁹⁵ It seems to be a thorough plan of attack by cyber means, ready to set in motion when necessary, clearly demonstrating collaboration of some sort with the Russian state.¹⁹⁶ Otherwise such precision in electing targets which would help facilitate the military invasion as it were in this case, would have been too much of a coincident. Investigations into the matter revealed that no traces of target reconnaissance were found in the days before the attacks, but rather had taken place in 2006, two years before the eruption of the Georgian-Russian war. This had given the perpetrator time to produce 'specially designed software' for the carefully selected targets to gain the effect desired.¹⁹⁷ The hackers also took special measures to ensure that the response to the Russian troops were disadvantaged.¹⁹⁸ Subsequent findings in the hacker forums consisted of not only planning, but rehearsals as well which strengthens the connection to Russia as it included military components.¹⁹⁹ While the instructions given to the hackers clearly gives reason to suspect Russian state involvement, the GreyGoose Project investigated the matter subsequently to the conflict and found no referrals in the forums to any state organ as having guided or controlled the operation.²⁰⁰ The technical trail did not give any conclusive evidence either. Examples of convincing evidence would consist of IP addresses to home computers of those responsible, online usernames linked to said persons or a written confession in regards to where the details of the operation came from. The websites used were based on fake identities and did not reveal an actual perpetrator. However, they ¹⁹⁰ Klimburg, p. 50 ¹⁹¹ Mshvidobadze K, <https: blogs=\"\"how-to-understand-russia-today=\"\"ukrainealert=\"\"www.atlanticcouncil.org=\"\"></https:> 'accessed 2 January 2021 ¹⁹² Klimburg, p. 49 ¹⁹³ Macak, p. 15 citing Nicaragua (n25) (112) ¹⁹⁴ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13 ¹⁹⁵ Macak, p. 11 ¹⁹⁶ McDougal, p. 63-64 ¹⁹⁷ Blank, p. 89 ¹⁹⁸ ibid, p. 90 ¹⁹⁹ ibid, p. 90 ²⁰⁰ GreyLogic,, p. 20 contained a possible lead. The IP address from the corporation providing the hosting services were registered in the United States but physically located in St Petersburg, with their office in the same building as two state institutions and the headquarter of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Russian Armed Forces (GRU) in the area.²⁰¹ This is not strong enough evidence to link the instructions to a state organ, the connection is too far fetch with many open-ended questions. If the person who posted the instructions and led the torch in the planning would be identified, the legal discussion would become more interesting. If identified as a state organ the attributional link would exist automatically, provided the conduct was done in an official capacity.²⁰² If this would be the case but the state organ’s actions reached beyond the scope of it’s mandate, the conduct would still entail the responsibility of the state under article 7 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility.²⁰³ If on the other hand the person responsible were identified as a private person the relationship between the private person and Russia must be made clear, in order for the possibility of establishing attribution to exist and produce a conclusion on the issue.²⁰⁴ Efforts were made by Russia by putting the blame for the attacks on patriotic hackers as having acted on their own accord, explicitly stating that perhaps ‘individuals in Russia or elsewhere had taken it upon themselves to start attacks’.²⁰⁵ While this reeks of passivity it does not indicate any intention of Russia to take responsibility for the attacks although acknowledging that the perpetrators might be located within it’s borders. Although, this is not surprising. If such an intention had been given publicly it had been very counterintuitive, as the main advantage of going through hacktivists is the possibility to evade responsibility as it will be difficult to prove a connection. Due to this lack of intention this statement cannot be considered as acknowledgement and adoption under article 11 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.²⁰⁶ It does not elevate beyond the criteria of ‘mere support and endorsement’.²⁰⁷ It do however raises the issue of due diligence, an obligation of customary status entailing the responsibility to prevent attacks from occurring and to take measures to prosecute if prevention is unsuccessful.²⁰⁸ Since no such measures were taken neither before or after the attacks, in spite of government knowledge of the thriving cybercrime culture, the issue of due diligence will be the natural subsequent issue to examine.\n²⁰¹ GreyLogic, p. 16-17 + Heickerö R, FOI, p. 45-46 ²⁰² DARSIWA, art. 4 §3, p. 40 ²⁰³ DARSIWA, art. 7, p. 26 ²⁰⁴ DARSIWA, General Principles, p. 38 ²⁰⁵ Connell M, Vogler S, p. 13 ²⁰⁶ DARSIWA, art. 11 §4, p. 53 ²⁰⁷ DARSIWA, art. 11, Commentary (6), p. 53 ²⁰⁸ Kulesza J, State responsibility for cyber-attacks on international peace and security, (2009), p. 11 # Conclusion The phenomenon of states relying on the their nationalistic citizens to perpetuate cyber attacks against foreign adversaries is not likely to perish, but rather to flourish. The use of private persons allow for the evasion of legal responsibility as it is difficult to connect the conduct of said persons with the, allegedly, controlling state. The cyber network has provided the opportunity to gain access to sensitive infrastructure critical to both day-to-day life and the national security, without the exposure to imminent identification and danger entailing such identification. Regardless of the types or specifics of the launched cyber attacks, the consequences may have serious longstanding effects. Some will be physical and others will be psychological, all while the resources necessary won't be too monstrous. With the case of Russia, their pool of highly skilled hacktivists will continue to provide their efforts to the 'patriotic activities' when asked, creating enough of a distant between the perpetrators of the conduct and the state, so as to not implicate the latter.\nWith the cases of Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 it is not possible to hold Russia legally responsible for the cyber attacks through attribution under article 4, article 5, article 8 or article 11. Both cases showed apparent state-involvement, but without any indisputable evidence towards Russian responsibility the attribution cannot be made.\nEstonia were hit by waves of DDoS-attacks which hit several important targets including the country's communication and banking system. Instructions of how to perpetrate cyber attacks against these specific targets were released prior to the actual launch, on known hacker forums. While this gave strong indications of state-involvement, as the coordination and intelligence were too extraordinary to be the work of individual hackers solely, the state of Russia can not be considered responsible as there are insufficient evidence in regards to who actually posted these instructions in the forums. The circumstances gives the appearance of a situation in which it is possible to hold Russia legally responsible. Despite this, the effort fails. The specifics and authenticity regarding the confession of the assistant Goloskokov is insufficient in tying the attacks to a state organ, the statements from officials have not expressed the intention of adoption needed for attribution under article 11, and the relationship between Russia and the Nashi Youth Group does not include employment to exercise governmental authority or rises to the level of effective control.\nAttribution is not possible in the case of Georgia either. Despite several actors identified, such as the Nashi, Russian Business Network and individual hacktivists. Here, there are almost stronger incitement to hold Russia responsible as their military advances were coordinated with the cyber attacks and thus clearly connected. Once again are the source of the instructions given unknown and the relationship between Russia and Nashi and the RBN unhelpful of establishing attribution.\nCyber attacks constitute tempting alternatives to kinetic means because they are saturated of difficulties in regards to establishing the origin location of the attack, which have been elaborated upon in this thesis. Going forward, this will have implications for the international community as a whole as it is shaping our conception of warfare as well as peacetime relations."

    "abstract": "While there are many examples to turn to regarding the thriving phenomenon of private persons being exploited to launch cyber attacks on behalf of states, this thesis will direct its attention onto two special cases. Russia has been accused of being the state actor behind the cyber attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. The cases are chosen as Estonia have been recognised as the first coordinated cyber attack on a foreign country, and Georgia being the first case were cyber attacks have been utilised in synchronisation with military action. The purpose of the thesis is to analyse the facts of each case in relation to the International Law Commission's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The analysis will work through article 4, article 5, article 8 and article 11. The main question is how Russia may be held as legally responsible under international law for the private conduct of 'patriotic' hackers, the Nashi Youth Group and the Russian Business Network. The thesis concludes that while the circumstances of each case highly indicate state-involvement, this cannot be proven under the respective criteria of the articles and Russia does not bear legal responsibility.
