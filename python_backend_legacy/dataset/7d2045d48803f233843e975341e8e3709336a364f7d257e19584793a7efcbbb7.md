A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all\n¹ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n² Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n³ These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nthe other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation'. If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation\nA State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n383\nThe obligation of cessation has been confirmed by the ICJ in various cases.¹⁰ As noted by the ILC in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, ‘[t]he function of cessation is to put an end to a violation of international law and to safeguard the continuing validity and effectiveness of the underlying primary rule. The responsible State’s obligation of cessation thus protects both the interests of the injured State or States and the interests of the international community as a whole in the preservation of, and reliance on, the rule of law.’¹¹ In practice, cessation may be requested not only by the injured State, but also by other subjects of international law, most notably the General Assembly or Security Council of the United Nations.¹²\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct.¹³ Secondly, the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of reparation, explicitly adopted by the ILC in the\nRainbow Warrior case, cessation would have taken the form of the return of the two French agents: Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 270, para 113.\n¹⁰ Haya de la Torre (Colombia v.

The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation.¹⁵ Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.¹⁶\nThe obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation.¹⁷ The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached\n¹⁴ See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (CUP 2013) 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n¹⁵ Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n¹⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n¹⁷ Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n385\nby cyber operations must still be in force when requiring the cessation of the wrongful conduct. The first criterion, conversely, calls for some analysis: the wrongful acts need to be continuing or repeated on a series of occasions implying the possibility of future repetition.¹⁸ The resultant question for this study is: in which circumstances may cyber operations constitute a continuing wrongful act? It is important to highlight that in most cases the wrongful cyber operations will continue to breach the international obligation as long as they last. It is not only the launching of a cyber operation that constitutes, for instance, a violation of the principle of sovereignty or non-intervention or the prohibition of the use of force.\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n¹⁸ Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State.¹⁹ The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation.²⁰ The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n¹⁹ See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n²⁰ See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n387\nbeen removed from the infected system. I propose two cumulative criteria to identify the compliance of the responsible State with its obligation of cessation concerning the malware infection: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator. The malware would then become a dormant piece of code lost in the targeted system. Secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information to the targeted State for the complete and definitive removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. This implies the communication of the exploited vulnerabilities in the targeted system. Thus, cessation would not equate to re-establishing the status quo ante, as would be the case in restitutio in integrum, but would furnish the injured State with all the necessary information to re-establish the status quo ante. It would also give the injured State the chance to update its system and remove the vulnerability exploited by the intruders – and thus prevent further possible intrusions through this same vulnerability.\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall.²¹ The shift into the\n²¹ Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation\nVarious forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition\nThe responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require.²² Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.²³\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n²³ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389\nreparation.²⁴ They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions.²⁵ Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations.²⁶ Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State.²⁷ In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.²⁸\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time,²⁹ the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition.³⁰ This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence,³¹ and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n²⁴ Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n²⁵ Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n²⁶ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n²⁷ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n²⁸ ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n²⁹ However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment) [1997] ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 63; and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.³²\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection³³ in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.³⁴\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees.³⁵ Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.³⁶ The\n166–167, para 466; Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v.

States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures.³⁹ Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures.⁴⁰ General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.⁴¹\n³⁷ Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n³⁸ Tams (n 30) 85.\n³⁹ Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n⁴⁰ Barbier (n 23) 559.\n⁴¹ LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.⁴²\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases.⁴³ The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.⁴⁴\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute.⁴⁵ The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁴⁶\n⁴² Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n⁴³ Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n⁴⁴ Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n⁴⁵ Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n⁴⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n393\nDepending on the circumstances and the nature of the breached obligation, the obligations of the responsible State may be owed to one or more States, as well as to the international community as a whole.⁴⁷ The obligation owed by the responsible State extends to other States, and not just the injured State, in the case of a breach of an obligation owed to a group of States (erga omnes partes obligations), or extends to all States for a breach of an obligation to the international community as a whole (erga omnes obligations).⁴⁸ Conversely, only the injured State can benefit from the obligation to make full reparation.⁴⁹ For instance, a State breaching the prohibition on recourse to force may have its responsibility invoked by any State, as it is violating an erga omnes obligation. However, only the injured State may be entitled to request the reparation of the injury suffered.⁵⁰\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.⁵¹ Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).\n## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury\nThe definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international\n⁴⁷ ibid, Article 33(1).\n⁴⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application: 1962) (Judgment of Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Reports 3, 32, para 33 (‘In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.’).\n⁴⁹ In some circumstances, individuals protected by the primary obligation that has been breached might also benefit from the obligation of reparation, notably when it comes to human rights obligations; see, for instance: Stern (n 48) 567; Susan Marks et al, ‘Responsibility for Violations of Human Rights Obligations’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 725–790.\n⁵⁰ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 568.\n⁵¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nlawyers.⁵² The debate focuses on what is the exact meaning and content of each term. James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’,⁵³ and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’.⁵⁴ Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’.⁵⁵ The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist.⁵⁶ The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁵⁷ Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.⁵⁸\n## 9.3.2 Causality\nThe responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.⁵⁹ Thus, there must be a causal link between the injury and the internationally wrongful act attributed to the responsible State.⁶⁰\n⁵² James Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL) (OUP 2006) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1093, para 27; Brigitte Stern argues that there is no difference between the terms ‘injury’ and ‘damage’: Stern (n 48) 569; see also Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485–492.\n⁵³ James Crawford, ‘Fourth Report on State Responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur’ (International Law Commission 2001) DOCUMENT A/CN.4/517 and Add.1, 9, para 33; Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’ (MPEPIL) (n 52) para 27; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485.\n⁵⁴ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(2).\n⁵⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n⁵⁶ See, generally, Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 266–267, paras 107–110.\n⁵⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁵⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 9; see, however, the critical analysis of the ILC Articles’ approach on causation in Stern (n 48) 569–570.\n⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁶⁰ See, generally: d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 622 et seq; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 492 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nThe reparation awarded to the injured State may be negatively affected by any wilful or negligent act, or omission, on the part of the injured State or of the person seeking reparation.⁶¹\nTo sum-up, a perpetrator State has an obligation to make reparation only if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, the occurrence of an injury, and secondly, there must be a causal link between this injury and the internationally wrongful act.⁶² Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate\nThe ‘duty to mitigate’⁶³ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility.⁶⁴ Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State.⁶⁵ This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation.⁶⁶ However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n⁶¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n⁶² Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n⁶³ The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁴ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n⁶⁵ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n⁶⁶ Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.⁶⁷\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss.⁶⁸ It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ The following case exemplifies this position.\n⁶⁷ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n⁶⁸ The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁹ On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n397\nOn 25 January 2003, the Slammer worm⁷⁰ infected thousands of servers worldwide in less than fifteen minutes by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server. Slammer led to significant disruptive effects, such as slowing down and disrupting Internet connection in several countries, shutting down thousands of Bank of America’s ATMs and blocking the ticketing system of Continental Airlines, forcing the company to cancel several flights. The objective of the worm, however, was to infect the system memory and from there to search for other hosts to infect; it did not take control of the system or affect the data stored on the hard drive. The removal of the worm was an easy procedure, which entailed closing the point of entry used by Slammer, port 1434, and rebooting the server. Servers not yet infected could prevent the infection by closing their port 1434. Slammer also infected the computer system of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in the United States, causing disruption to the normal functioning of the Safety Parameter Display System. It is hoped that the infection of the nuclear plant system did not produce any long-term damage. The computer systems of the nuclear plant were protected by a firewall and should not have been vulnerable to Slammer. However, the worm was able to bypass the firewall because a consultant had created a connection behind the firewall between the network of the nuclear plant and the network of his office. In response to this incident, a firewall has been established between the two networks.\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the\n⁷⁰ The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation. On Slammer, see, generally: Edward Ray, ‘Malware FAQ: MS-SQL Slammer’ (SANS) www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/ms-sql-exploit.php; ‘WORM:W32/SLAMMER’ (F-Secure) www.f-secure.com/v-descs/mssqlm.shtml; Paul Boutin, ‘Slammed!’, WIRED (1 July 2003) www.wired.com/2003/07/slammer/; Brent Kesler, ‘The Vulnerability of Nuclear Facilities to Cyber Attack’ (2010) 10 Strategic Insights 15, 19–20. See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nfact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n399\nmeasures imposing the implementation of robust cyber security for sensitive infrastructure detracts from the responsibility of private companies and focuses on the State. However, such duty seems to impose a disproportionate burden on the State. Thus, the duty to implement robust cybersecurity may not be practicable in practice, especially as it can only directly apply to state-owned cyber infrastructures. Concerning the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation, the same considerations also apply. It would be disproportionate to hold a State responsible for deficient cyber security of private actors. Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur – in other words ‘nobody is held to the impossible’ – justifies the limitation of the duty of mitigation when a State is not in a position to comply. These proposals on the interpretation of the duty to mitigate in the cyber context may be confirmed or discarded by future State practice. It is likely that States will confirm that the duty to mitigate applies in cyberspace, and their practice will define the limitations of this duty.\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation\nThe obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n72 Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nparticular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.⁷³\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution,⁷⁴ which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante.⁷⁵ Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate.⁷⁶ The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’.⁷⁷ Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused.⁷⁸ Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n⁷³ Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n⁷⁴ Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v. Guinea) (Judgment) [1999] ITLOS Reports, para 170; Award on the Merits in Dispute between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company/ California Asiatic Oil Company and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (Compensation for Nationalized Property) (1978) 17 International Legal Materials 1, 36, para 109; see also Gray (n 14) 589.\n⁷⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35 requests the re-establishment of ‘the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed’, which constitutes the narrowest understanding of restitution. A broader understanding of restitution would imply the (re) establishment of the situation, as it would have existed without the perpetration of the wrongful act: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 96, commentary to Article 35, para 2.\n⁷⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(1); as confirmed in the above extract from Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47; see, for instance, Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 621–625 and 651–742, in which compensation was considered after it was concluded that restitution was impossible.\n⁷⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(2).\n⁷⁸ ibid, Article 37(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nreparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.⁷⁹\nRestitution, compensation and satisfaction are the only forms of reparation possible.⁸⁰ The three different forms of reparation may be invoked separately or in combination in order to satisfy the obligation of full reparation.⁸¹ For instance, in some circumstances restitution might be insufficient and thus complemented with compensation.⁸² In addition to the three exclusive forms of reparation – restitution, compensation and satisfaction, interest might be awarded either to ensure the full reparation as an element of reparation (pre-award interest) or in relation to the payment of the awarded sum (post-award interest).⁸³ The award of interest and its rate are determined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe obligation of reparation does have limits, however. For instance, the reparation, either made by restitution, compensation or satisfaction, should be proportionate to the loss suffered.⁸⁴ Moreover, if the injured State or person contributed to the injury, whether wilfully\n⁷⁹ ibid, Article 37(2); the PCIJ did not refer to satisfaction in Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47, and mentioned only restitution and compensation as forms of reparation.

Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 435–436; see also Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122.\n⁸⁰ Yann Kerbrat, ‘Interaction Between the Forms of Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 573.\n⁸¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\n⁸² Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47–48; The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) 65, para 170; Papamichalopoulos and Others v.

Peru (Reparations and Costs) (1998) Series C No 42 Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), 20, para 87 (‘[t]he reparations ordered in this Judgment must be proportionate to the violations [...]’). Accordingly, restitution should not ‘involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation’ (Article 35(b)); compensation ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage’ (Article 36); and finally, satisfaction ‘shall not be out of proportion to the injury’ (Article 37(3)).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nor negligently, this should be taken into account and limit the reparation.⁸⁵\nAfter this brief presentation of the forms that reparation may take, the following subsections focus on each head of reparation – restitution (9.3.4.1), compensation (9.3.4.2) and satisfaction (9.3.4.3) – and analyse how they may be appropriate in the context of damage caused by cyber operations.\n## 9.3.4.1 Restitution\nRestitution is the first and principal form of reparation. It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached.⁸⁶ Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.⁸⁷\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice.⁸⁸ It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’⁸⁹ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.⁹⁰\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation.⁹¹ Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of\n⁸⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n⁸⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n⁸⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n⁸⁸ Gray (n 14) 590.\n⁸⁹ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n⁹⁰ ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n⁹¹ Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'.[92] In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution.[93] In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant',[94] which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State.[95] Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.[96]\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.⁹⁷\n⁹⁷ Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation\nCompensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate.⁹⁸ The customary international law principle of compensation⁹⁹ as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ,¹⁰⁰ and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁰¹\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’.¹⁰² In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation.¹⁰³ The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n⁹⁸ Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n⁹⁹ John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n¹⁰⁰ *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n¹⁰¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n¹⁰² ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n¹⁰³ *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nDamage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.¹⁰⁴\nFor instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel.¹⁰⁵ Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies.¹⁰⁶ For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew.¹⁰⁷ The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.¹⁰⁸\nIt is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case.¹¹⁰ The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n¹⁰⁴ 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n¹⁰⁵ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

Generally, the legitimate interests of the State that require protection may be grouped into three categories: its sovereignty, its properties and its nationals.[112] The question relevant to this book is: are cyber operations able to cause such damage? In other words, can cyber operations cause damage which then invokes the responsibility of the perpetrating State? This subsection provides a positive answer to this question, which the following paragraphs will demonstrate.\nThe structure of this subsection is based on the different forms of damage that cyber operations may cause. In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory.[113] This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart. As recently as 2014, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt\n[111] 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n[112] d'Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 595.\n[113] See, generally, the description of the Aurora test in Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also Jeanne Meserve, 'Mouse Click Could Plunge City into Darkness, Experts Say' (CNN, 27 September 2007) http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/power.at.risk/index.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nfür Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however.¹¹⁴ According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage.¹¹⁵ However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure¹¹⁶ may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.¹¹⁷\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary\n¹¹⁴ ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n¹¹⁵ Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n¹¹⁶ On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n¹¹⁷ This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n409\ndepending on the primary obligation breached and the specific facts of the case.¹¹⁸ Thus, the assessment of compensation will be made on a case-by-case basis.\n(ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data.¹¹⁹ The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems.¹²⁰ No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n¹¹⁸ Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n¹¹⁹ Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n¹²⁰ Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ndistress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.¹²¹\n(iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware\nThe removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory.¹²² The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area.¹²³ Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.¹²⁴\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable.¹²⁵ Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.¹²⁶ In\n¹²¹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 1) 144–145, commentary to Rule 28, para 2.\n¹²² ‘Claim against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by Soviet Cosmos 954’ (n 121) 899–930.\n¹²³ ibid 903–904, para 8.\n¹²⁴ ‘Protocol in Respect of the Claim for Damages Caused by the Satellite “Cosmos 954”.

The ICJ identified that the non-material damage caused by the wrongful act of the Democratic Republic of the Congo resulted in significant psychological suffering and loss of reputation,¹²⁷ and awarded US$85,000 in compensation for this non-material damage.¹²⁸\nCyber operations might cause moral damage. For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner.¹²⁹ During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler.¹³⁰ This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber\nto Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification \"financially assessable\" is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as \"moral damage\" to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n¹²⁷ Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively.¹³¹ Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers.¹³² In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.\n## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction\nSatisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation.¹³³ Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage.¹³⁴ The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage:\nState practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations\n¹³¹ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n¹³² Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n¹³³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n¹³⁴ Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation. This practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.”).

The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.¹³⁸\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate\n¹³⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n¹³⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 629–634.\n¹³⁷ Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n¹³⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nits wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^[139]^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation\nThis section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya\n'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^[140]^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^[141]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n415\nSome States hold the Russian Federation responsible for NotPetya, leading to the question of reparation for the consequences of the cyber operations if those States were actually invoking the responsibility of Russia. The three available forms of reparation under the law of State responsibility are: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. Since NotPetya wiped off the infected systems, it would be impossible to repair its consequences through restitution. Conversely, compensation appears to be an appropriate option for the reparation of the consequences of NotPetya since it resulted in important economic losses. Finally, the victim States might also decide to request that, in addition to compensation, the reparation also take the form of satisfaction, such as the acknowledgement by the responsible State of its wrongful behaviour.\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million.¹⁴² According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n¹⁴² Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v.

This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n2. a) hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual, impending or expected attack by any:\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto);\n(ii) military, naval, or air force; or\n(iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^[143]^\nThese two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.\n## 9.4 Shared Responsibility\nIn some circumstances, more than one State may be responsible for the injury suffered by the victim State.^[144]^ Two situations involving multiple States that are responsible for an injury can be distinguished.^[145]^ On the one hand, the States responsible may have committed different\n^[143]^ Tabby Kinder, ‘Companies at Risk as Hiscox Rules out DLA Piper’s Cyberattack Claim’, *The Times* (25 March 2019) www.thetimes.co.uk/article/companies-at-risk-as-insurer-rules-out-cyberattack-claim-2psj2jbz0.\n^[144]^ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.

Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State.¹⁴⁷ Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States\nIn the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury.¹⁴⁸ A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’¹⁴⁹ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B.¹⁵⁰ Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n¹⁴⁶ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n¹⁴⁷ ibid 232 et seq.\n¹⁴⁸ ibid 222.\n¹⁴⁹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n¹⁵⁰ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nconsequences of its own acts.¹⁵¹ Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.¹⁵²\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States\nIn the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible¹⁵³ and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately.¹⁵⁴ The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.¹⁵⁵\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n¹⁵¹ ibid 224–227.\n¹⁵² ibid 227–232.\n¹⁵³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n¹⁵⁴ Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v.

In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself.¹⁵⁶ The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C.¹⁵⁷ In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n¹⁵⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n¹⁵⁷ On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nregime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility\nStates may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n421\n# 9.5 Concluding Remarks on State Responsibility and the Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Cyber Operation\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State.¹⁵⁹ This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n¹⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
  "flat_text": "The existence of secondary rules of responsibility stems from two cumulative elements: a breach of an international obligation and the attribution of this breach to a State. Thus, responsibility arises without its invocation by an injured State, as clearly stated by Article 1 of the Articles on State Responsibility:\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.\nAs a consequence of an internationally wrongful act, the wrongdoing State bears an obligation of cessation, non-repetition and reparation of the wrongful act. These consequences are automatic and do not depend on any action by the injured State.\nThe injured State is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another State (the responsible State) for its conduct, or omission, if the latter breaches an obligation owed to the former on an individual basis. A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all\n The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nthe other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation'. If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation\nA State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct. Secondly, the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of reparation, explicitly adopted by the ILC in the\nRainbow Warrior case, cessation would have taken the form of the return of the two French agents: Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 270, para 113.\n Haya de la Torre (Colombia v.

For instance, in cases involving the release of hostages or the return of seized objects or premises, the distinction is impossible as these actions constitute both the cessation and the reparation of the wrongful conduct. The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation. Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.\nThe obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation. The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached\n See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (CUP 2013) 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State. The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation. The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall. The shift into the\n Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation\nVarious forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition\nThe responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require. Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389\nreparation. They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions. Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations. Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State. In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time, the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition. This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence, and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment) [1997] ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 63; and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees. Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.

The circumstances must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, thus it would be difficult to identify in advance the situations that would require assurances and guarantees.\nAlthough their interpretation is not completely settled, the norms of international law are applicable to cyber operations. States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures. Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures. General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.\n Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n Tams (n 30) 85.\n Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n Barbier (n 23) 559.\n LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases. The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute. The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.\n Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).\n## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury\nThe definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international\n ibid, Article 33(1).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application: 1962) (Judgment of Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Reports 3, 32, para 33 (‘In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.’).\n In some circumstances, individuals protected by the primary obligation that has been breached might also benefit from the obligation of reparation, notably when it comes to human rights obligations; see, for instance: Stern (n 48) 567; Susan Marks et al, ‘Responsibility for Violations of Human Rights Obligations’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 725–790.\n d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 568.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nlawyers. The debate focuses on what is the exact meaning and content of each term. James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’, and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’. Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’. The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist. The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’. Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.\n## 9.3.2 Causality\nThe responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts. Thus, there must be a causal link between the injury and the internationally wrongful act attributed to the responsible State.\n James Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL) (OUP 2006) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1093, para 27; Brigitte Stern argues that there is no difference between the terms ‘injury’ and ‘damage’: Stern (n 48) 569; see also Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485–492.\n James Crawford, ‘Fourth Report on State Responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur’ (International Law Commission 2001) DOCUMENT A/CN.4/517 and Add.1, 9, para 33; Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’ (MPEPIL) (n 52) para 27; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(2).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n See, generally, Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 266–267, paras 107–110.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 9; see, however, the critical analysis of the ILC Articles’ approach on causation in Stern (n 48) 569–570.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n See, generally: d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 622 et seq; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 492 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nThe reparation awarded to the injured State may be negatively affected by any wilful or negligent act, or omission, on the part of the injured State or of the person seeking reparation.\nTo sum-up, a perpetrator State has an obligation to make reparation only if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, the occurrence of an injury, and secondly, there must be a causal link between this injury and the internationally wrongful act. Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate\nThe ‘duty to mitigate’ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility. Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State. This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation. However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss. It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure. The following case exemplifies this position.\n Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the\n The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation. On Slammer, see, generally: Edward Ray, ‘Malware FAQ: MS-SQL Slammer’ (SANS) www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/ms-sql-exploit.php; ‘WORM:W32/SLAMMER’ (F-Secure) www.f-secure.com/v-descs/mssqlm.shtml; Paul Boutin, ‘Slammed!’, WIRED (1 July 2003) www.wired.com/2003/07/slammer/; Brent Kesler, ‘The Vulnerability of Nuclear Facilities to Cyber Attack’ (2010) 10 Strategic Insights 15, 19–20. See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nfact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation\nThe obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nparticular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution, which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante. Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate. The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’. Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused. Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v. Guinea) (Judgment) [1999] ITLOS Reports, para 170; Award on the Merits in Dispute between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company/ California Asiatic Oil Company and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (Compensation for Nationalized Property) (1978) 17 International Legal Materials 1, 36, para 109; see also Gray (n 14) 589.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35 requests the re-establishment of ‘the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed’, which constitutes the narrowest understanding of restitution. A broader understanding of restitution would imply the (re) establishment of the situation, as it would have existed without the perpetration of the wrongful act: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 96, commentary to Article 35, para 2.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(1); as confirmed in the above extract from Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47; see, for instance, Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 621–625 and 651–742, in which compensation was considered after it was concluded that restitution was impossible.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(2).\n ibid, Article 37(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nreparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.\nRestitution, compensation and satisfaction are the only forms of reparation possible. The three different forms of reparation may be invoked separately or in combination in order to satisfy the obligation of full reparation. For instance, in some circumstances restitution might be insufficient and thus complemented with compensation. In addition to the three exclusive forms of reparation – restitution, compensation and satisfaction, interest might be awarded either to ensure the full reparation as an element of reparation (pre-award interest) or in relation to the payment of the awarded sum (post-award interest). The award of interest and its rate are determined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe obligation of reparation does have limits, however. For instance, the reparation, either made by restitution, compensation or satisfaction, should be proportionate to the loss suffered.

Accordingly, restitution should not ‘involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation’ (Article 35(b)); compensation ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage’ (Article 36); and finally, satisfaction ‘shall not be out of proportion to the injury’ (Article 37(3)).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nor negligently, this should be taken into account and limit the reparation.\nAfter this brief presentation of the forms that reparation may take, the following subsections focus on each head of reparation – restitution (9.3.4.1), compensation (9.3.4.2) and satisfaction (9.3.4.3) – and analyse how they may be appropriate in the context of damage caused by cyber operations.\n## 9.3.4.1 Restitution\nRestitution is the first and principal form of reparation. It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached. Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice. It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation. Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n Gray (n 14) 590.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'.[92] In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution.[93] In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant',[94] which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State.[95] Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.[96]\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.\n Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation\nCompensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate. The customary international law principle of compensation as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ, and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’. In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation. The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nDamage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.\nFor instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel. Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies. For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew. The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.\nIt is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature. Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case. The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory.[113] This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart. As recently as 2014, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt\n[111] 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n[112] d'Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 595.\n[113] See, generally, the description of the Aurora test in Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also Jeanne Meserve, 'Mouse Click Could Plunge City into Darkness, Experts Say' (CNN, 27 September 2007) http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/power.at.risk/index.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nfür Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however. According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage. However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary\n ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\n(ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems. No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ndistress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.\n(iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware\nThe removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory. The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area. Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable. Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.

For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner. During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler. This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber\nto Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification \"financially assessable\" is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as \"moral damage\" to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively. Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers. In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.\n## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction\nSatisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation. Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage. The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage:\nState practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations\n Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation. This practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.”). See also: Bernard Graefrath, ‘Responsibility and Damages Caused: Relationship between Responsibility and Damages’ (1984) 185 RCADI 9, 69, 84; Capotorti (n 8) 266.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nSatisfaction may include non-material or moral reparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach. Moreover, there are limits to reparation by satisfaction as it should not be disproportionate or humiliate the State responsible for the damage.\nThis study intends to determine when satisfaction can be awarded for the injury resulting from cyber operations. The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 629–634.\n Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nits wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^[139]^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation\nThis section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya\n'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^[140]^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^[141]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million. According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v. Zurich American Insurance Company (Defendant) Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois 2018-L-011008.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nBy a letter dated 1 June 2018, Zurich American Insurance denied coverage of the losses of Mondelēz International based on exclusion B.2 (a) of the insurance policy:\nB. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n2. a) hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual, impending or expected attack by any:\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto);\n(ii) military, naval, or air force; or\n(iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^[143]^\nThese two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.\n## 9.4 Shared Responsibility\nIn some circumstances, more than one State may be responsible for the injury suffered by the victim State.^[144]^ Two situations involving multiple States that are responsible for an injury can be distinguished.^[145]^ On the one hand, the States responsible may have committed different\n^[143]^ Tabby Kinder, ‘Companies at Risk as Hiscox Rules out DLA Piper’s Cyberattack Claim’, *The Times* (25 March 2019) www.thetimes.co.uk/article/companies-at-risk-as-insurer-rules-out-cyberattack-claim-2psj2jbz0.\n^[144]^ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.

For instance, a national from State C may have been abducted by State A and then transferred to State B, which tortured him. Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State. Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States\nIn the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury. A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B. Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n ibid 232 et seq.\n ibid 222.\n Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nconsequences of its own acts. Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States\nIn the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately. The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n ibid 224–227.\n ibid 227–232.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) (Judgment on the Preliminary Objections) [1992] ICJ Reports 240, 258–259, para 48.\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 237–241.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSHARED RESPONSIBILITY\nThe joint commission of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms and the participation of each State may not have the same impact. In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself. The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C. In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nregime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility\nStates may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State. This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

    "## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation": "A State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n383\nThe obligation of cessation has been confirmed by the ICJ in various cases.¹⁰ As noted by the ILC in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, ‘[t]he function of cessation is to put an end to a violation of international law and to safeguard the continuing validity and effectiveness of the underlying primary rule. The responsible State’s obligation of cessation thus protects both the interests of the injured State or States and the interests of the international community as a whole in the preservation of, and reliance on, the rule of law.’¹¹ In practice, cessation may be requested not only by the injured State, but also by other subjects of international law, most notably the General Assembly or Security Council of the United Nations.¹²\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct.¹³ Secondly, the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of reparation, explicitly adopted by the ILC in the\nRainbow Warrior case, cessation would have taken the form of the return of the two French agents: Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 270, para 113.\n¹⁰ Haya de la Torre (Colombia v.

The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation.¹⁵ Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.¹⁶\nThe obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation.¹⁷ The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached\n¹⁴ See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (CUP 2013) 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n¹⁵ Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n¹⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n¹⁷ Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n385\nby cyber operations must still be in force when requiring the cessation of the wrongful conduct. The first criterion, conversely, calls for some analysis: the wrongful acts need to be continuing or repeated on a series of occasions implying the possibility of future repetition.¹⁸ The resultant question for this study is: in which circumstances may cyber operations constitute a continuing wrongful act? It is important to highlight that in most cases the wrongful cyber operations will continue to breach the international obligation as long as they last. It is not only the launching of a cyber operation that constitutes, for instance, a violation of the principle of sovereignty or non-intervention or the prohibition of the use of force.",
    "## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n¹⁸ Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY",
    "## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware": "The intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State.¹⁹ The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation.²⁰ The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n¹⁹ See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n²⁰ See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n387\nbeen removed from the infected system. I propose two cumulative criteria to identify the compliance of the responsible State with its obligation of cessation concerning the malware infection: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator. The malware would then become a dormant piece of code lost in the targeted system. Secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information to the targeted State for the complete and definitive removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. This implies the communication of the exploited vulnerabilities in the targeted system. Thus, cessation would not equate to re-establishing the status quo ante, as would be the case in restitutio in integrum, but would furnish the injured State with all the necessary information to re-establish the status quo ante. It would also give the injured State the chance to update its system and remove the vulnerability exploited by the intruders – and thus prevent further possible intrusions through this same vulnerability.\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall.²¹ The shift into the\n²¹ Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.",
    "## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation": "Various forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.",
    "## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition": "The responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require.²² Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.²³\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n²³ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389\nreparation.²⁴ They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions.²⁵ Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations.²⁶ Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State.²⁷ In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.²⁸\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time,²⁹ the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition.³⁰ This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence,³¹ and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n²⁴ Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n²⁵ Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n²⁶ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n²⁷ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n²⁸ ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n²⁹ However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment)  ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J.

Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.³²\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection³³ in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.³⁴\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees.³⁵ Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.³⁶ The\n166–167, para 466; Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v.

States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures.³⁹ Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures.⁴⁰ General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.⁴¹\n³⁷ Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n³⁸ Tams (n 30) 85.\n³⁹ Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n⁴⁰ Barbier (n 23) 559.\n⁴¹ LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.",
    "## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation": "The Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.⁴²\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases.⁴³ The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.⁴⁴\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute.⁴⁵ The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁴⁶\n⁴² Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n⁴³ Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n⁴⁴ Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n⁴⁵ Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n⁴⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n393\nDepending on the circumstances and the nature of the breached obligation, the obligations of the responsible State may be owed to one or more States, as well as to the international community as a whole.⁴⁷ The obligation owed by the responsible State extends to other States, and not just the injured State, in the case of a breach of an obligation owed to a group of States (erga omnes partes obligations), or extends to all States for a breach of an obligation to the international community as a whole (erga omnes obligations).⁴⁸ Conversely, only the injured State can benefit from the obligation to make full reparation.⁴⁹ For instance, a State breaching the prohibition on recourse to force may have its responsibility invoked by any State, as it is violating an erga omnes obligation. However, only the injured State may be entitled to request the reparation of the injury suffered.⁵⁰\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.⁵¹ Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).",
    "## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury": "The definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international\n⁴⁷ ibid, Article 33(1).\n⁴⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application: 1962) (Judgment of Second Phase)  ICJ Reports 3, 32, para 33 (‘In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.’).\n⁴⁹ In some circumstances, individuals protected by the primary obligation that has been breached might also benefit from the obligation of reparation, notably when it comes to human rights obligations; see, for instance: Stern (n 48) 567; Susan Marks et al, ‘Responsibility for Violations of Human Rights Obligations’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 725–790.\n⁵⁰ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 568.\n⁵¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nlawyers.⁵² The debate focuses on what is the exact meaning and content of each term. James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’,⁵³ and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’.⁵⁴ Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’.⁵⁵ The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist.⁵⁶ The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁵⁷ Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.⁵⁸",
    "## 9.3.2 Causality": "The responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.⁵⁹ Thus, there must be a causal link between the injury and the internationally wrongful act attributed to the responsible State.⁶⁰\n⁵² James Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL) (OUP 2006) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1093, para 27; Brigitte Stern argues that there is no difference between the terms ‘injury’ and ‘damage’: Stern (n 48) 569; see also Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485–492.\n⁵³ James Crawford, ‘Fourth Report on State Responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur’ (International Law Commission 2001) DOCUMENT A/CN.4/517 and Add.1, 9, para 33; Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’ (MPEPIL) (n 52) para 27; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485.\n⁵⁴ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(2).\n⁵⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n⁵⁶ See, generally, Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 266–267, paras 107–110.\n⁵⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁵⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 9; see, however, the critical analysis of the ILC Articles’ approach on causation in Stern (n 48) 569–570.\n⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁶⁰ See, generally: d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 622 et seq; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 492 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nThe reparation awarded to the injured State may be negatively affected by any wilful or negligent act, or omission, on the part of the injured State or of the person seeking reparation.⁶¹\nTo sum-up, a perpetrator State has an obligation to make reparation only if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, the occurrence of an injury, and secondly, there must be a causal link between this injury and the internationally wrongful act.⁶² Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.",
    "## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate": "The ‘duty to mitigate’⁶³ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility.⁶⁴ Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State.⁶⁵ This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation.⁶⁶ However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n⁶¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n⁶² Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n⁶³ The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁴ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n⁶⁵ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n⁶⁶ Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.⁶⁷\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss.⁶⁸ It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ The following case exemplifies this position.\n⁶⁷ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n⁶⁸ The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁹ On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n397\nOn 25 January 2003, the Slammer worm⁷⁰ infected thousands of servers worldwide in less than fifteen minutes by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server. Slammer led to significant disruptive effects, such as slowing down and disrupting Internet connection in several countries, shutting down thousands of Bank of America’s ATMs and blocking the ticketing system of Continental Airlines, forcing the company to cancel several flights. The objective of the worm, however, was to infect the system memory and from there to search for other hosts to infect; it did not take control of the system or affect the data stored on the hard drive. The removal of the worm was an easy procedure, which entailed closing the point of entry used by Slammer, port 1434, and rebooting the server. Servers not yet infected could prevent the infection by closing their port 1434. Slammer also infected the computer system of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in the United States, causing disruption to the normal functioning of the Safety Parameter Display System. It is hoped that the infection of the nuclear plant system did not produce any long-term damage. The computer systems of the nuclear plant were protected by a firewall and should not have been vulnerable to Slammer. However, the worm was able to bypass the firewall because a consultant had created a connection behind the firewall between the network of the nuclear plant and the network of his office. In response to this incident, a firewall has been established between the two networks.\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds.

See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nfact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n399\nmeasures imposing the implementation of robust cyber security for sensitive infrastructure detracts from the responsibility of private companies and focuses on the State. However, such duty seems to impose a disproportionate burden on the State. Thus, the duty to implement robust cybersecurity may not be practicable in practice, especially as it can only directly apply to state-owned cyber infrastructures. Concerning the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation, the same considerations also apply. It would be disproportionate to hold a State responsible for deficient cyber security of private actors. Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur – in other words ‘nobody is held to the impossible’ – justifies the limitation of the duty of mitigation when a State is not in a position to comply. These proposals on the interpretation of the duty to mitigate in the cyber context may be confirmed or discarded by future State practice. It is likely that States will confirm that the duty to mitigate applies in cyberspace, and their practice will define the limitations of this duty.\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.",
    "## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation": "The obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n72 Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nparticular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.⁷³\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution,⁷⁴ which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante.⁷⁵ Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate.⁷⁶ The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’.⁷⁷ Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused.⁷⁸ Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n⁷³ Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n⁷⁴ Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v.

Accordingly, restitution should not ‘involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation’ (Article 35(b)); compensation ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage’ (Article 36); and finally, satisfaction ‘shall not be out of proportion to the injury’ (Article 37(3)).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nor negligently, this should be taken into account and limit the reparation.⁸⁵\nAfter this brief presentation of the forms that reparation may take, the following subsections focus on each head of reparation – restitution (9.3.4.1), compensation (9.3.4.2) and satisfaction (9.3.4.3) – and analyse how they may be appropriate in the context of damage caused by cyber operations.",
    "## 9.3.4.1 Restitution": "Restitution is the first and principal form of reparation. It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached.⁸⁶ Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.⁸⁷\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice.⁸⁸ It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’⁸⁹ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.⁹⁰\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation.⁹¹ Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of\n⁸⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n⁸⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n⁸⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n⁸⁸ Gray (n 14) 590.\n⁸⁹ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n⁹⁰ ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n⁹¹ Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'. In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution. In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant', which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State. Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.⁹⁷\n⁹⁷ Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.",
    "## 9.3.4.2 Compensation": "Compensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate.⁹⁸ The customary international law principle of compensation⁹⁹ as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ,¹⁰⁰ and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁰¹\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’.¹⁰² In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation.¹⁰³ The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n⁹⁸ Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n⁹⁹ John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n¹⁰⁰ *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n¹⁰¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n¹⁰² ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n¹⁰³ *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nDamage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.¹⁰⁴\nFor instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel.¹⁰⁵ Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies.¹⁰⁶ For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew.¹⁰⁷ The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.¹⁰⁸\nIt is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case.¹¹⁰ The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n¹⁰⁴ 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n¹⁰⁵ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

The damage results in the harm to legitimate interests of the State. Generally, the legitimate interests of the State that require protection may be grouped into three categories: its sovereignty, its properties and its nationals. The question relevant to this book is: are cyber operations able to cause such damage? In other words, can cyber operations cause damage which then invokes the responsibility of the perpetrating State? This subsection provides a positive answer to this question, which the following paragraphs will demonstrate.\nThe structure of this subsection is based on the different forms of damage that cyber operations may cause. In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory. This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart. As recently as 2014, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt\n 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n d'Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 595.\n See, generally, the description of the Aurora test in Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also Jeanne Meserve, 'Mouse Click Could Plunge City into Darkness, Experts Say' (CNN, 27 September 2007) http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/power.at.risk/index.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nfür Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however.¹¹⁴ According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage.¹¹⁵ However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure¹¹⁶ may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.¹¹⁷\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary\n¹¹⁴ ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n¹¹⁵ Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n¹¹⁶ On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n¹¹⁷ This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n409\ndepending on the primary obligation breached and the specific facts of the case.¹¹⁸ Thus, the assessment of compensation will be made on a case-by-case basis.\n(ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data.¹¹⁹ The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems.¹²⁰ No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n¹¹⁸ Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n¹¹⁹ Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n¹²⁰ Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ndistress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.¹²¹\n(iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware\nThe removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory.¹²² The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area.¹²³ Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.¹²⁴\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable.¹²⁵ Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.¹²⁶ In\n¹²¹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 1) 144–145, commentary to Rule 28, para 2.\n¹²² ‘Claim against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by Soviet Cosmos 954’ (n 121) 899–930.\n¹²³ ibid 903–904, para 8.\n¹²⁴ ‘Protocol in Respect of the Claim for Damages Caused by the Satellite “Cosmos 954”.

The ICJ identified that the non-material damage caused by the wrongful act of the Democratic Republic of the Congo resulted in significant psychological suffering and loss of reputation,¹²⁷ and awarded US$85,000 in compensation for this non-material damage.¹²⁸\nCyber operations might cause moral damage. For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner.¹²⁹ During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler.¹³⁰ This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber\nto Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification \"financially assessable\" is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as \"moral damage\" to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n¹²⁷ Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively.¹³¹ Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers.¹³² In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.",
    "## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction": "Satisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation.¹³³ Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage.¹³⁴ The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage:\nState practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations\n¹³¹ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n¹³² Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n¹³³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n¹³⁴ Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation. This practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.”). See also: Bernard Graefrath, ‘Responsibility and Damages Caused: Relationship between Responsibility and Damages’ (1984) 185 RCADI 9, 69, 84; Capotorti (n 8) 266.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n413\nof sovereignty or territorial integrity, attacks on ships or aircraft, ill-treatment of or deliberate attacks on heads of State or Government or diplomatic or consular representatives or other protected persons and violations of the premises of embassies or consulates or of the residences of members of the mission.¹³⁵\nSatisfaction may include non-material or moral reparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.¹³⁶ Moreover, there are limits to reparation by satisfaction as it should not be disproportionate or humiliate the State responsible for the damage.¹³⁷\nThis study intends to determine when satisfaction can be awarded for the injury resulting from cyber operations. The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.¹³⁸\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate\n¹³⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n¹³⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 629–634.\n¹³⁷ Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n¹³⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nits wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.",
    "## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation": "This section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.",
    "## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya": "'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n415\nSome States hold the Russian Federation responsible for NotPetya, leading to the question of reparation for the consequences of the cyber operations if those States were actually invoking the responsibility of Russia. The three available forms of reparation under the law of State responsibility are: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. Since NotPetya wiped off the infected systems, it would be impossible to repair its consequences through restitution. Conversely, compensation appears to be an appropriate option for the reparation of the consequences of NotPetya since it resulted in important economic losses. Finally, the victim States might also decide to request that, in addition to compensation, the reparation also take the form of satisfaction, such as the acknowledgement by the responsible State of its wrongful behaviour.\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million.¹⁴² According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n¹⁴² Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v. Zurich American Insurance Company (Defendant) Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois 2018-L-011008.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nBy a letter dated 1 June 2018, Zurich American Insurance denied coverage of the losses of Mondelēz International based on exclusion B.2 (a) of the insurance policy:\nB. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n2. a) hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual, impending or expected attack by any:\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto);\n(ii) military, naval, or air force; or\n(iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^^\nThese two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.",

Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State.¹⁴⁷ Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.",
    "## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States": "In the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury.¹⁴⁸ A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’¹⁴⁹ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B.¹⁵⁰ Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n¹⁴⁶ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n¹⁴⁷ ibid 232 et seq.\n¹⁴⁸ ibid 222.\n¹⁴⁹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n¹⁵⁰ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nconsequences of its own acts.¹⁵¹ Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.¹⁵²\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.",
    "## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States": "In the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible¹⁵³ and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately.¹⁵⁴ The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.¹⁵⁵\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n¹⁵¹ ibid 224–227.\n¹⁵² ibid 227–232.\n¹⁵³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n¹⁵⁴ Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v.

In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself.¹⁵⁶ The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C.¹⁵⁷ In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n¹⁵⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n¹⁵⁷ On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nregime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.",
    "### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility": "States may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n421",
    "__postscript__": "# 9.5 Concluding Remarks on State Responsibility and the Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Cyber Operation\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State.¹⁵⁹ This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n¹⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Thus, responsibility arises without its invocation by an injured State, as clearly stated by Article 1 of the Articles on State Responsibility:\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.\nAs a consequence of an internationally wrongful act, the wrongdoing State bears an obligation of cessation, non-repetition and reparation of the wrongful act. These consequences are automatic and do not depend on any action by the injured State.\nThe injured State is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another State (the responsible State) for its conduct, or omission, if the latter breaches an obligation owed to the former on an individual basis. A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all\n The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nthe other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation'. If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation\nA State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct. Secondly, the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of reparation, explicitly adopted by the ILC in the\nRainbow Warrior case, cessation would have taken the form of the return of the two French agents: Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 270, para 113.\n Haya de la Torre (Colombia v.

For instance, in cases involving the release of hostages or the return of seized objects or premises, the distinction is impossible as these actions constitute both the cessation and the reparation of the wrongful conduct. The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation. Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.\nThe obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation. The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached\n See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (CUP 2013) 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State. The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation. The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall. The shift into the\n Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation\nVarious forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition\nThe responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require. Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389\nreparation. They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions. Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations. Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State. In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time, the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition. This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence, and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment) [1997] ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 63; and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees. Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.

The circumstances must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, thus it would be difficult to identify in advance the situations that would require assurances and guarantees.\nAlthough their interpretation is not completely settled, the norms of international law are applicable to cyber operations. States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures. Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures. General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.\n Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n Tams (n 30) 85.\n Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n Barbier (n 23) 559.\n LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases. The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute. The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.\n Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).\n## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury\nThe definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international\n ibid, Article 33(1).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v.

James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’, and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’. Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’. The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist. The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’. Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.\n## 9.3.2 Causality\nThe responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.

Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate\nThe ‘duty to mitigate’ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility. Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State. This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation. However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss. It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure. The following case exemplifies this position.\n Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the\n The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation. On Slammer, see, generally: Edward Ray, ‘Malware FAQ: MS-SQL Slammer’ (SANS) www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/ms-sql-exploit.php; ‘WORM:W32/SLAMMER’ (F-Secure) www.f-secure.com/v-descs/mssqlm.shtml; Paul Boutin, ‘Slammed!’, WIRED (1 July 2003) www.wired.com/2003/07/slammer/; Brent Kesler, ‘The Vulnerability of Nuclear Facilities to Cyber Attack’ (2010) 10 Strategic Insights 15, 19–20. See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nfact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation\nThe obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nparticular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution, which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante. Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate. The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’. Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused. Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v. Guinea) (Judgment) [1999] ITLOS Reports, para 170; Award on the Merits in Dispute between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company/ California Asiatic Oil Company and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (Compensation for Nationalized Property) (1978) 17 International Legal Materials 1, 36, para 109; see also Gray (n 14) 589.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35 requests the re-establishment of ‘the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed’, which constitutes the narrowest understanding of restitution. A broader understanding of restitution would imply the (re) establishment of the situation, as it would have existed without the perpetration of the wrongful act: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 96, commentary to Article 35, para 2.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(1); as confirmed in the above extract from Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47; see, for instance, Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 621–625 and 651–742, in which compensation was considered after it was concluded that restitution was impossible.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(2).\n ibid, Article 37(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nreparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.\nRestitution, compensation and satisfaction are the only forms of reparation possible. The three different forms of reparation may be invoked separately or in combination in order to satisfy the obligation of full reparation. For instance, in some circumstances restitution might be insufficient and thus complemented with compensation. In addition to the three exclusive forms of reparation – restitution, compensation and satisfaction, interest might be awarded either to ensure the full reparation as an element of reparation (pre-award interest) or in relation to the payment of the awarded sum (post-award interest). The award of interest and its rate are determined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe obligation of reparation does have limits, however. For instance, the reparation, either made by restitution, compensation or satisfaction, should be proportionate to the loss suffered. Moreover, if the injured State or person contributed to the injury, whether wilfully\n ibid, Article 37(2); the PCIJ did not refer to satisfaction in Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47, and mentioned only restitution and compensation as forms of reparation.

Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 435–436; see also Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122.\n Yann Kerbrat, ‘Interaction Between the Forms of Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 573.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\n Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47–48; The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) 65, para 170; Papamichalopoulos and Others v.

The superimposing of a penalty in addition to full compensation and naming it damages, with the qualifying word exemplary, vindictive, or punitive, is a hopeless confusion of terms, inevitably leading to confusion of thought.’; see also Loayza-Tamayo v. Peru (Reparations and Costs) (1998) Series C No 42 Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), 20, para 87 (‘[t]he reparations ordered in this Judgment must be proportionate to the violations [...]’). Accordingly, restitution should not ‘involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation’ (Article 35(b)); compensation ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage’ (Article 36); and finally, satisfaction ‘shall not be out of proportion to the injury’ (Article 37(3)).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nor negligently, this should be taken into account and limit the reparation.\nAfter this brief presentation of the forms that reparation may take, the following subsections focus on each head of reparation – restitution (9.3.4.1), compensation (9.3.4.2) and satisfaction (9.3.4.3) – and analyse how they may be appropriate in the context of damage caused by cyber operations.\n## 9.3.4.1 Restitution\nRestitution is the first and principal form of reparation. It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached. Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice. It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation. Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n Gray (n 14) 590.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'.[92] In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution.[93] In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant',[94] which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State.[95] Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.[96]\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.\n Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation\nCompensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate. The customary international law principle of compensation as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ, and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’. In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation. The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nDamage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.\nFor instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel. Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies. For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew. The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.\nIt is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature. Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case. The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory.[113] This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart. As recently as 2014, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt\n[111] 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n[112] d'Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 595.\n[113] See, generally, the description of the Aurora test in Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also Jeanne Meserve, 'Mouse Click Could Plunge City into Darkness, Experts Say' (CNN, 27 September 2007) http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/power.at.risk/index.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nfür Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however. According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage. However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary\n ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\n(ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems. No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ndistress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.\n(iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware\nThe removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory. The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area. Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable. Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.

For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner. During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler. This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber\nto Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification \"financially assessable\" is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as \"moral damage\" to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively. Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers. In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.\n## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction\nSatisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation. Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage. The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage:\nState practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations\n Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation. This practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.”). See also: Bernard Graefrath, ‘Responsibility and Damages Caused: Relationship between Responsibility and Damages’ (1984) 185 RCADI 9, 69, 84; Capotorti (n 8) 266.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nSatisfaction may include non-material or moral reparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach. Moreover, there are limits to reparation by satisfaction as it should not be disproportionate or humiliate the State responsible for the damage.\nThis study intends to determine when satisfaction can be awarded for the injury resulting from cyber operations. The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 629–634.\n Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nits wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^[139]^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation\nThis section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya\n'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^[140]^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^[141]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million. According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v. Zurich American Insurance Company (Defendant) Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois 2018-L-011008.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nBy a letter dated 1 June 2018, Zurich American Insurance denied coverage of the losses of Mondelēz International based on exclusion B.2 (a) of the insurance policy:\nB. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n2. a) hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual, impending or expected attack by any:\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto);\n(ii) military, naval, or air force; or\n(iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^[143]^\nThese two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.\n## 9.4 Shared Responsibility\nIn some circumstances, more than one State may be responsible for the injury suffered by the victim State.^[144]^ Two situations involving multiple States that are responsible for an injury can be distinguished.^[145]^ On the one hand, the States responsible may have committed different\n^[143]^ Tabby Kinder, ‘Companies at Risk as Hiscox Rules out DLA Piper’s Cyberattack Claim’, *The Times* (25 March 2019) www.thetimes.co.uk/article/companies-at-risk-as-insurer-rules-out-cyberattack-claim-2psj2jbz0.\n^[144]^ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.

For instance, a national from State C may have been abducted by State A and then transferred to State B, which tortured him. Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State. Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States\nIn the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury. A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B. Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n ibid 232 et seq.\n ibid 222.\n Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nconsequences of its own acts. Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States\nIn the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately. The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n ibid 224–227.\n ibid 227–232.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) (Judgment on the Preliminary Objections) [1992] ICJ Reports 240, 258–259, para 48.\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 237–241.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSHARED RESPONSIBILITY\nThe joint commission of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms and the participation of each State may not have the same impact. In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself. The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C. In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nregime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility\nStates may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State. This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty.

      "flat_text": "The existence of secondary rules of responsibility stems from two cumulative elements: a breach of an international obligation and the attribution of this breach to a State. Thus, responsibility arises without its invocation by an injured State, as clearly stated by Article 1 of the Articles on State Responsibility:\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.\nAs a consequence of an internationally wrongful act, the wrongdoing State bears an obligation of cessation, non-repetition and reparation of the wrongful act. These consequences are automatic and do not depend on any action by the injured State.\nThe injured State is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another State (the responsible State) for its conduct, or omission, if the latter breaches an obligation owed to the former on an individual basis. A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all\n The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nthe other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation'. If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation\nA State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct.

For instance, in cases involving the release of hostages or the return of seized objects or premises, the distinction is impossible as these actions constitute both the cessation and the reparation of the wrongful conduct. The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation. Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.\nThe obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation. The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached\n See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (CUP 2013) 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State. The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation. The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall. The shift into the\n Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation\nVarious forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition\nThe responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require. Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389\nreparation. They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions. Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations. Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State. In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time, the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition. This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence, and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment) [1997] ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 63; and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees. Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.

The circumstances must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, thus it would be difficult to identify in advance the situations that would require assurances and guarantees.\nAlthough their interpretation is not completely settled, the norms of international law are applicable to cyber operations. States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures. Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures. General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.\n Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n Tams (n 30) 85.\n Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n Barbier (n 23) 559.\n LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases. The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute. The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.\n Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).\n## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury\nThe definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international\n ibid, Article 33(1).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application: 1962) (Judgment of Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Reports 3, 32, para 33 (‘In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.’).\n In some circumstances, individuals protected by the primary obligation that has been breached might also benefit from the obligation of reparation, notably when it comes to human rights obligations; see, for instance: Stern (n 48) 567; Susan Marks et al, ‘Responsibility for Violations of Human Rights Obligations’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 725–790.\n d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 568.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nlawyers. The debate focuses on what is the exact meaning and content of each term. James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’, and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’. Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’. The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist. The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’. Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.\n## 9.3.2 Causality\nThe responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.

Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate\nThe ‘duty to mitigate’ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility. Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State. This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation. However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss. It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure. The following case exemplifies this position.\n Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the\n The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation. On Slammer, see, generally: Edward Ray, ‘Malware FAQ: MS-SQL Slammer’ (SANS) www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/ms-sql-exploit.php; ‘WORM:W32/SLAMMER’ (F-Secure) www.f-secure.com/v-descs/mssqlm.shtml; Paul Boutin, ‘Slammed!’, WIRED (1 July 2003) www.wired.com/2003/07/slammer/; Brent Kesler, ‘The Vulnerability of Nuclear Facilities to Cyber Attack’ (2010) 10 Strategic Insights 15, 19–20. See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nfact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation\nThe obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nparticular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution, which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante. Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate. The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’. Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused. Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v. Guinea) (Judgment) [1999] ITLOS Reports, para 170; Award on the Merits in Dispute between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company/ California Asiatic Oil Company and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (Compensation for Nationalized Property) (1978) 17 International Legal Materials 1, 36, para 109; see also Gray (n 14) 589.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35 requests the re-establishment of ‘the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed’, which constitutes the narrowest understanding of restitution. A broader understanding of restitution would imply the (re) establishment of the situation, as it would have existed without the perpetration of the wrongful act: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 96, commentary to Article 35, para 2.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(1); as confirmed in the above extract from Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47; see, for instance, Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 621–625 and 651–742, in which compensation was considered after it was concluded that restitution was impossible.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(2).\n ibid, Article 37(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nreparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.\nRestitution, compensation and satisfaction are the only forms of reparation possible. The three different forms of reparation may be invoked separately or in combination in order to satisfy the obligation of full reparation. For instance, in some circumstances restitution might be insufficient and thus complemented with compensation. In addition to the three exclusive forms of reparation – restitution, compensation and satisfaction, interest might be awarded either to ensure the full reparation as an element of reparation (pre-award interest) or in relation to the payment of the awarded sum (post-award interest). The award of interest and its rate are determined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe obligation of reparation does have limits, however. For instance, the reparation, either made by restitution, compensation or satisfaction, should be proportionate to the loss suffered. Moreover, if the injured State or person contributed to the injury, whether wilfully\n ibid, Article 37(2); the PCIJ did not refer to satisfaction in Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47, and mentioned only restitution and compensation as forms of reparation.

Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 435–436; see also Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122.\n Yann Kerbrat, ‘Interaction Between the Forms of Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 573.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\n Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47–48; The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) 65, para 170; Papamichalopoulos and Others v.

The superimposing of a penalty in addition to full compensation and naming it damages, with the qualifying word exemplary, vindictive, or punitive, is a hopeless confusion of terms, inevitably leading to confusion of thought.’; see also Loayza-Tamayo v. Peru (Reparations and Costs) (1998) Series C No 42 Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), 20, para 87 (‘[t]he reparations ordered in this Judgment must be proportionate to the violations [...]’). Accordingly, restitution should not ‘involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation’ (Article 35(b)); compensation ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage’ (Article 36); and finally, satisfaction ‘shall not be out of proportion to the injury’ (Article 37(3)).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nor negligently, this should be taken into account and limit the reparation.\nAfter this brief presentation of the forms that reparation may take, the following subsections focus on each head of reparation – restitution (9.3.4.1), compensation (9.3.4.2) and satisfaction (9.3.4.3) – and analyse how they may be appropriate in the context of damage caused by cyber operations.\n## 9.3.4.1 Restitution\nRestitution is the first and principal form of reparation. It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached. Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice. It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation. Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n Gray (n 14) 590.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'.[92] In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution.[93] In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant',[94] which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State.[95] Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.[96]\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.\n Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation\nCompensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate. The customary international law principle of compensation as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ, and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’. In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation. The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nDamage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.\nFor instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel. Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies. For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew. The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.\nIt is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature. Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case. The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory.[113] This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart.

It did not disclose its name, however. According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage. However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary\n ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\n(ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data. The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems. No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ndistress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.\n(iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware\nThe removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory. The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area. Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable. Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.

For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner. During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler. This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber\nto Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification \"financially assessable\" is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as \"moral damage\" to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively. Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers. In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.\n## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction\nSatisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation. Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage. The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage:\nState practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations\n Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation. This practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.”). See also: Bernard Graefrath, ‘Responsibility and Damages Caused: Relationship between Responsibility and Damages’ (1984) 185 RCADI 9, 69, 84; Capotorti (n 8) 266.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nSatisfaction may include non-material or moral reparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach. Moreover, there are limits to reparation by satisfaction as it should not be disproportionate or humiliate the State responsible for the damage.\nThis study intends to determine when satisfaction can be awarded for the injury resulting from cyber operations. The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate\n ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 629–634.\n Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nits wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^[139]^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation\nThis section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya\n'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^[140]^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^[141]^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million. According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v. Zurich American Insurance Company (Defendant) Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois 2018-L-011008.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nBy a letter dated 1 June 2018, Zurich American Insurance denied coverage of the losses of Mondelēz International based on exclusion B.2 (a) of the insurance policy:\nB. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n2. a) hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual, impending or expected attack by any:\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto);\n(ii) military, naval, or air force; or\n(iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^[143]^\nThese two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.\n## 9.4 Shared Responsibility\nIn some circumstances, more than one State may be responsible for the injury suffered by the victim State.^[144]^ Two situations involving multiple States that are responsible for an injury can be distinguished.^[145]^ On the one hand, the States responsible may have committed different\n^[143]^ Tabby Kinder, ‘Companies at Risk as Hiscox Rules out DLA Piper’s Cyberattack Claim’, *The Times* (25 March 2019) www.thetimes.co.uk/article/companies-at-risk-as-insurer-rules-out-cyberattack-claim-2psj2jbz0.\n^[144]^ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.

For instance, a national from State C may have been abducted by State A and then transferred to State B, which tortured him. Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State. Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States\nIn the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury. A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B. Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n ibid 232 et seq.\n ibid 222.\n Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nconsequences of its own acts. Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States\nIn the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately. The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n ibid 224–227.\n ibid 227–232.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) (Judgment on the Preliminary Objections) [1992] ICJ Reports 240, 258–259, para 48.\n d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 237–241.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSHARED RESPONSIBILITY\nThe joint commission of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms and the participation of each State may not have the same impact. In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself. The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C. In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nregime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility\nStates may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State. This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all\n¹ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n² Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n³ These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nthe other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation'. If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation\nA State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n383\nThe obligation of cessation has been confirmed by the ICJ in various cases.¹⁰ As noted by the ILC in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, ‘[t]he function of cessation is to put an end to a violation of international law and to safeguard the continuing validity and effectiveness of the underlying primary rule. The responsible State’s obligation of cessation thus protects both the interests of the injured State or States and the interests of the international community as a whole in the preservation of, and reliance on, the rule of law.’¹¹ In practice, cessation may be requested not only by the injured State, but also by other subjects of international law, most notably the General Assembly or Security Council of the United Nations.¹²\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct.¹³ Secondly, the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of reparation, explicitly adopted by the ILC in the\nRainbow Warrior case, cessation would have taken the form of the return of the two French agents: Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 270, para 113.\n¹⁰ Haya de la Torre (Colombia v.

The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation.¹⁵ Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.¹⁶\nThe obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation.¹⁷ The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached\n¹⁴ See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part (CUP 2013) 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n¹⁵ Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n¹⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n¹⁷ Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n385\nby cyber operations must still be in force when requiring the cessation of the wrongful conduct. The first criterion, conversely, calls for some analysis: the wrongful acts need to be continuing or repeated on a series of occasions implying the possibility of future repetition.¹⁸ The resultant question for this study is: in which circumstances may cyber operations constitute a continuing wrongful act? It is important to highlight that in most cases the wrongful cyber operations will continue to breach the international obligation as long as they last. It is not only the launching of a cyber operation that constitutes, for instance, a violation of the principle of sovereignty or non-intervention or the prohibition of the use of force.\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n¹⁸ Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State.¹⁹ The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation.²⁰ The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n¹⁹ See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n²⁰ See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n387\nbeen removed from the infected system. I propose two cumulative criteria to identify the compliance of the responsible State with its obligation of cessation concerning the malware infection: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator. The malware would then become a dormant piece of code lost in the targeted system. Secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information to the targeted State for the complete and definitive removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. This implies the communication of the exploited vulnerabilities in the targeted system. Thus, cessation would not equate to re-establishing the status quo ante, as would be the case in restitutio in integrum, but would furnish the injured State with all the necessary information to re-establish the status quo ante. It would also give the injured State the chance to update its system and remove the vulnerability exploited by the intruders – and thus prevent further possible intrusions through this same vulnerability.\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall.²¹ The shift into the\n²¹ Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation\nVarious forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition\nThe responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require.²² Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.²³\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n²³ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389\nreparation.²⁴ They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions.²⁵ Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations.²⁶ Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State.²⁷ In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.²⁸\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time,²⁹ the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition.³⁰ This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence,³¹ and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n²⁴ Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n²⁵ Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n²⁶ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n²⁷ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n²⁸ ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n²⁹ However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment)  ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J.

Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.³²\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection³³ in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.³⁴\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees.³⁵ Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.³⁶ The\n166–167, para 466; Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v.

States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures.³⁹ Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures.⁴⁰ General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.⁴¹\n³⁷ Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n³⁸ Tams (n 30) 85.\n³⁹ Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n⁴⁰ Barbier (n 23) 559.\n⁴¹ LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.⁴²\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases.⁴³ The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.⁴⁴\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute.⁴⁵ The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁴⁶\n⁴² Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n⁴³ Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n⁴⁴ Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n⁴⁵ Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n⁴⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n393\nDepending on the circumstances and the nature of the breached obligation, the obligations of the responsible State may be owed to one or more States, as well as to the international community as a whole.⁴⁷ The obligation owed by the responsible State extends to other States, and not just the injured State, in the case of a breach of an obligation owed to a group of States (erga omnes partes obligations), or extends to all States for a breach of an obligation to the international community as a whole (erga omnes obligations).⁴⁸ Conversely, only the injured State can benefit from the obligation to make full reparation.⁴⁹ For instance, a State breaching the prohibition on recourse to force may have its responsibility invoked by any State, as it is violating an erga omnes obligation. However, only the injured State may be entitled to request the reparation of the injury suffered.⁵⁰\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.⁵¹ Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).\n## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury\nThe definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international\n⁴⁷ ibid, Article 33(1).\n⁴⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application: 1962) (Judgment of Second Phase)  ICJ Reports 3, 32, para 33 (‘In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.’).\n⁴⁹ In some circumstances, individuals protected by the primary obligation that has been breached might also benefit from the obligation of reparation, notably when it comes to human rights obligations; see, for instance: Stern (n 48) 567; Susan Marks et al, ‘Responsibility for Violations of Human Rights Obligations’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 725–790.\n⁵⁰ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 568.\n⁵¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nlawyers.⁵² The debate focuses on what is the exact meaning and content of each term. James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’,⁵³ and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’.⁵⁴ Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’.⁵⁵ The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist.⁵⁶ The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁵⁷ Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.⁵⁸\n## 9.3.2 Causality\nThe responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.⁵⁹ Thus, there must be a causal link between the injury and the internationally wrongful act attributed to the responsible State.⁶⁰\n⁵² James Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL) (OUP 2006) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1093, para 27; Brigitte Stern argues that there is no difference between the terms ‘injury’ and ‘damage’: Stern (n 48) 569; see also Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485–492.\n⁵³ James Crawford, ‘Fourth Report on State Responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur’ (International Law Commission 2001) DOCUMENT A/CN.4/517 and Add.1, 9, para 33; Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’ (MPEPIL) (n 52) para 27; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485.\n⁵⁴ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(2).\n⁵⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n⁵⁶ See, generally, Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 266–267, paras 107–110.\n⁵⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁵⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 9; see, however, the critical analysis of the ILC Articles’ approach on causation in Stern (n 48) 569–570.\n⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁶⁰ See, generally: d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 622 et seq; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 492 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nThe reparation awarded to the injured State may be negatively affected by any wilful or negligent act, or omission, on the part of the injured State or of the person seeking reparation.⁶¹\nTo sum-up, a perpetrator State has an obligation to make reparation only if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, the occurrence of an injury, and secondly, there must be a causal link between this injury and the internationally wrongful act.⁶² Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate\nThe ‘duty to mitigate’⁶³ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility.⁶⁴ Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State.⁶⁵ This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation.⁶⁶ However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n⁶¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n⁶² Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n⁶³ The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁴ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n⁶⁵ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n⁶⁶ Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.⁶⁷\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss.⁶⁸ It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ The following case exemplifies this position.\n⁶⁷ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n⁶⁸ The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁹ On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n397\nOn 25 January 2003, the Slammer worm⁷⁰ infected thousands of servers worldwide in less than fifteen minutes by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server. Slammer led to significant disruptive effects, such as slowing down and disrupting Internet connection in several countries, shutting down thousands of Bank of America’s ATMs and blocking the ticketing system of Continental Airlines, forcing the company to cancel several flights. The objective of the worm, however, was to infect the system memory and from there to search for other hosts to infect; it did not take control of the system or affect the data stored on the hard drive. The removal of the worm was an easy procedure, which entailed closing the point of entry used by Slammer, port 1434, and rebooting the server. Servers not yet infected could prevent the infection by closing their port 1434. Slammer also infected the computer system of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in the United States, causing disruption to the normal functioning of the Safety Parameter Display System. It is hoped that the infection of the nuclear plant system did not produce any long-term damage. The computer systems of the nuclear plant were protected by a firewall and should not have been vulnerable to Slammer. However, the worm was able to bypass the firewall because a consultant had created a connection behind the firewall between the network of the nuclear plant and the network of his office. In response to this incident, a firewall has been established between the two networks.\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the\n⁷⁰ The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation. On Slammer, see, generally: Edward Ray, ‘Malware FAQ: MS-SQL Slammer’ (SANS) www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/ms-sql-exploit.php; ‘WORM:W32/SLAMMER’ (F-Secure) www.f-secure.com/v-descs/mssqlm.shtml; Paul Boutin, ‘Slammed!’, WIRED (1 July 2003) www.wired.com/2003/07/slammer/; Brent Kesler, ‘The Vulnerability of Nuclear Facilities to Cyber Attack’ (2010) 10 Strategic Insights 15, 19–20. See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nfact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n399\nmeasures imposing the implementation of robust cyber security for sensitive infrastructure detracts from the responsibility of private companies and focuses on the State. However, such duty seems to impose a disproportionate burden on the State. Thus, the duty to implement robust cybersecurity may not be practicable in practice, especially as it can only directly apply to state-owned cyber infrastructures. Concerning the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation, the same considerations also apply. It would be disproportionate to hold a State responsible for deficient cyber security of private actors. Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur – in other words ‘nobody is held to the impossible’ – justifies the limitation of the duty of mitigation when a State is not in a position to comply. These proposals on the interpretation of the duty to mitigate in the cyber context may be confirmed or discarded by future State practice. It is likely that States will confirm that the duty to mitigate applies in cyberspace, and their practice will define the limitations of this duty.\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation\nThe obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n72 Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nparticular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.⁷³\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution,⁷⁴ which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante.⁷⁵ Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate.⁷⁶ The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’.⁷⁷ Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused.⁷⁸ Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n⁷³ Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n⁷⁴ Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v. Guinea) (Judgment)  ITLOS Reports, para 170; Award on the Merits in Dispute between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company/ California Asiatic Oil Company and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (Compensation for Nationalized Property) (1978) 17 International Legal Materials 1, 36, para 109; see also Gray (n 14) 589.\n⁷⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35 requests the re-establishment of ‘the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed’, which constitutes the narrowest understanding of restitution. A broader understanding of restitution would imply the (re) establishment of the situation, as it would have existed without the perpetration of the wrongful act: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 96, commentary to Article 35, para 2.\n⁷⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(1); as confirmed in the above extract from Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47; see, for instance, Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 621–625 and 651–742, in which compensation was considered after it was concluded that restitution was impossible.\n⁷⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(2).\n⁷⁸ ibid, Article 37(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nreparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.⁷⁹\nRestitution, compensation and satisfaction are the only forms of reparation possible.⁸⁰ The three different forms of reparation may be invoked separately or in combination in order to satisfy the obligation of full reparation.⁸¹ For instance, in some circumstances restitution might be insufficient and thus complemented with compensation.⁸² In addition to the three exclusive forms of reparation – restitution, compensation and satisfaction, interest might be awarded either to ensure the full reparation as an element of reparation (pre-award interest) or in relation to the payment of the awarded sum (post-award interest).⁸³ The award of interest and its rate are determined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe obligation of reparation does have limits, however.

It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached.⁸⁶ Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.⁸⁷\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice.⁸⁸ It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’⁸⁹ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.⁹⁰\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation.⁹¹ Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of\n⁸⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n⁸⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n⁸⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n⁸⁸ Gray (n 14) 590.\n⁸⁹ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n⁹⁰ ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n⁹¹ Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'. In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution. In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant', which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State. Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.⁹⁷\n⁹⁷ Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation\nCompensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate.⁹⁸ The customary international law principle of compensation⁹⁹ as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ,¹⁰⁰ and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁰¹\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’.¹⁰² In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation.¹⁰³ The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n⁹⁸ Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n⁹⁹ John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n¹⁰⁰ *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n¹⁰¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n¹⁰² ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n¹⁰³ *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nDamage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.¹⁰⁴\nFor instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel.¹⁰⁵ Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies.¹⁰⁶ For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew.¹⁰⁷ The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.¹⁰⁸\nIt is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case.¹¹⁰ The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n¹⁰⁴ 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n¹⁰⁵ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

The damage results in the harm to legitimate interests of the State. Generally, the legitimate interests of the State that require protection may be grouped into three categories: its sovereignty, its properties and its nationals. The question relevant to this book is: are cyber operations able to cause such damage? In other words, can cyber operations cause damage which then invokes the responsibility of the perpetrating State? This subsection provides a positive answer to this question, which the following paragraphs will demonstrate.\nThe structure of this subsection is based on the different forms of damage that cyber operations may cause. In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory. This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart. As recently as 2014, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt\n 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n d'Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 595.\n See, generally, the description of the Aurora test in Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon (Crown 2014); see also Jeanne Meserve, 'Mouse Click Could Plunge City into Darkness, Experts Say' (CNN, 27 September 2007) http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/power.at.risk/index.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nfür Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however.¹¹⁴ According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage.¹¹⁵ However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure¹¹⁶ may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.¹¹⁷\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary\n¹¹⁴ ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n¹¹⁵ Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n¹¹⁶ On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n¹¹⁷ This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n409\ndepending on the primary obligation breached and the specific facts of the case.¹¹⁸ Thus, the assessment of compensation will be made on a case-by-case basis.\n(ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data.¹¹⁹ The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems.¹²⁰ No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n¹¹⁸ Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n¹¹⁹ Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n¹²⁰ Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\ndistress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.¹²¹\n(iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware\nThe removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory.¹²² The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area.¹²³ Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.¹²⁴\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable.¹²⁵ Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.¹²⁶ In\n¹²¹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 1) 144–145, commentary to Rule 28, para 2.\n¹²² ‘Claim against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by Soviet Cosmos 954’ (n 121) 899–930.\n¹²³ ibid 903–904, para 8.\n¹²⁴ ‘Protocol in Respect of the Claim for Damages Caused by the Satellite “Cosmos 954”.

The ICJ identified that the non-material damage caused by the wrongful act of the Democratic Republic of the Congo resulted in significant psychological suffering and loss of reputation,¹²⁷ and awarded US$85,000 in compensation for this non-material damage.¹²⁸\nCyber operations might cause moral damage. For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner.¹²⁹ During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler.¹³⁰ This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber\nto Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification \"financially assessable\" is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as \"moral damage\" to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n¹²⁷ Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively.¹³¹ Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers.¹³² In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.\n## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction\nSatisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation.¹³³ Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage.¹³⁴ The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage:\nState practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations\n¹³¹ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n¹³² Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n¹³³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n¹³⁴ Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation.

The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.¹³⁸\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate\n¹³⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n¹³⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 629–634.\n¹³⁷ Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n¹³⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nits wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation\nThis section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya\n'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^^\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n415\nSome States hold the Russian Federation responsible for NotPetya, leading to the question of reparation for the consequences of the cyber operations if those States were actually invoking the responsibility of Russia. The three available forms of reparation under the law of State responsibility are: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. Since NotPetya wiped off the infected systems, it would be impossible to repair its consequences through restitution. Conversely, compensation appears to be an appropriate option for the reparation of the consequences of NotPetya since it resulted in important economic losses. Finally, the victim States might also decide to request that, in addition to compensation, the reparation also take the form of satisfaction, such as the acknowledgement by the responsible State of its wrongful behaviour.\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million.¹⁴² According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n¹⁴² Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v. Zurich American Insurance Company (Defendant) Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois 2018-L-011008.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nBy a letter dated 1 June 2018, Zurich American Insurance denied coverage of the losses of Mondelēz International based on exclusion B.2 (a) of the insurance policy:\nB. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n2. a) hostile or warlike action in time of peace or war, including action in hindering, combating or defending against an actual, impending or expected attack by any:\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto);\n(ii) military, naval, or air force; or\n(iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^^\nThese two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.\n## 9.4 Shared Responsibility\nIn some circumstances, more than one State may be responsible for the injury suffered by the victim State.^^ Two situations involving multiple States that are responsible for an injury can be distinguished.^^ On the one hand, the States responsible may have committed different\n^^ Tabby Kinder, ‘Companies at Risk as Hiscox Rules out DLA Piper’s Cyberattack Claim’, *The Times* (25 March 2019) www.thetimes.co.uk/article/companies-at-risk-as-insurer-rules-out-cyberattack-claim-2psj2jbz0.\n^^ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.

Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State.¹⁴⁷ Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States\nIn the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury.¹⁴⁸ A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’¹⁴⁹ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B.¹⁵⁰ Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n¹⁴⁶ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n¹⁴⁷ ibid 232 et seq.\n¹⁴⁸ ibid 222.\n¹⁴⁹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n¹⁵⁰ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\nconsequences of its own acts.¹⁵¹ Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.¹⁵²\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States\nIn the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible¹⁵³ and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately.¹⁵⁴ The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.¹⁵⁵\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n¹⁵¹ ibid 224–227.\n¹⁵² ibid 227–232.\n¹⁵³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n¹⁵⁴ Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) (Judgment on the Preliminary Objections)  ICJ Reports 240, 258–259, para 48.\n¹⁵⁵ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 237–241.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSHARED RESPONSIBILITY\nThe joint commission of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms and the participation of each State may not have the same impact. In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself.¹⁵⁶ The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C.¹⁵⁷ In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n¹⁵⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n¹⁵⁷ On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nregime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility\nStates may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n421\n# 9.5 Concluding Remarks on State Responsibility and the Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Cyber Operation\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State.¹⁵⁹ This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n¹⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

      "flat_text": "The existence of secondary rules of responsibility stems from two cumulative elements: a breach of an international obligation and the attribution of this breach to a State.¹ Thus, responsibility arises without its invocation by an injured State, as clearly stated by Article 1 of the Articles on State Responsibility: Every internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.² As a consequence of an internationally wrongful act, the wrongdoing State bears an obligation of cessation, non-repetition and reparation of the wrongful act.³ These consequences are automatic and do not depend on any action by the injured State.\nThe injured State is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another State (the responsible State) for its conduct, or omission, if the latter breaches an obligation owed to the former on an individual basis. A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all ¹ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n² Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n³ These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY the other States to which the obligation is owed with respect to the further performance of the obligation'. If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation A State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF CESSATION Cessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation. Firstly, it is sometimes considered to function as part of the duty to comply with the primary obligation breached by the wrongful conduct.¹³ Secondly, the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of reparation, explicitly adopted by the ILC in the Rainbow Warrior case, cessation would have taken the form of the return of the two French agents: Case concerning the difference between New Zealand and France concerning the interpretation or application of two agreements, concluded on 9 July 1986 between the two States and which related to the problems arising from the Rainbow Warrior Affair (1990) 20 RIAA 215, 270, para 113.\n¹⁰ Haya de la Torre (Colombia v.

The two obligations have, however, a different content: cessation means that the State, which is responsible for a continuing wrongful act, is under an obligation to cease that act. While restitution consists in re-establishing the status quo ante. Generally, cessation would not equate with the re-establishment of the situation as it existed before the wrongful act was committed, which is part of the obligation of reparation.¹⁵ Moreover, the distinction between cessation and reparation is also important as cessation is not bound by the same limitations as reparation. For example, cessation is not bound by the requirement of proportionality.¹⁶ The obligation of cessation has two cumulative criteria: firstly, the wrongful conduct has a continuing character; secondly, the breached obligation is still in force at the time of the order of cessation.¹⁷ The second criterion does not need further elaboration, given that it is unchallenged by the shift into the cyber realm. The obligation breached ¹⁴ See the analysis of this debate in Deman (n 7) 486–494; d’Argent, ibid 675; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, paras 7–8. A minority of commentators maintain that cessation cannot be differentiated from the restitutio in integrum; see, generally: Benedetto Conforti, ‘Cours général de droit international public’ (1988) 212 RCADI 9, 206–207; Massimo Iovane, La riparazione nella teoria e nella prassi dell’illecito internazionale (Istituto di diritto internazionale dell’Università di Napoli, A Giuffre 1990) 181; Christian Dominicé, ‘Observations sur les droits de l’État victime d’un fait internationalement illicite’, Droit International 2 (Institut de hautes études internationales, Pedone 1982) 17–31; republished in Jeanne Belhumeur and Luigi Condorelli (eds), L’ordre juridique international entre tradition et innovation: recueil d’études (Publications de l’Institut de hautes études internationales, Presses universitaires de France 1997) 261–316.\nChristine Gray argues that there was confusion between restitution and cessation in the Rainbow Warrior case, with the consequence of leaving ‘New Zealand without an adequate remedy for the violation of its rights by France’: Christine Gray, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Restitution’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 590; see, contra, James Crawford, State Responsibility: The General Part 466; see also, contra, ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 8.\n¹⁵ Jurisdictional Immunities (Judgment) (n 10) 153, para 137.\n¹⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 7.\n¹⁷ Rainbow Warrior (n 9) 270, para 114.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n¹⁸ Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSTATE RESPONSIBILITY\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State.¹⁹ The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation.²⁰ The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n¹⁹ See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n²⁰ See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall.²¹ The shift into the ²¹ Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds), https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY cyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation Various forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition The responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require.²² Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.²³ The obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of Völkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n²³ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press ASSURANCES AND GUARANTEES OF NON-REPETITION 389 reparation.²⁴ They must, however, be distinguished as they serve different functions.²⁵ Satisfaction is backward-looking and concerns the past or current wrongful conduct, and aims at restoring the status quo ante or at least repairing the consequences of the wrongful act. By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations.²⁶ Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State.²⁷ In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.²⁸ In 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time,²⁹ the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition.³⁰ This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence,³¹ and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required: ²⁴ Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n²⁵ Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n²⁶ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n²⁷ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n²⁸ ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n²⁹ However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment) [1997] ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 477, para. 63; and Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.³² The responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection³³ in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.³⁴ The difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees.³⁵ Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.³⁶ The 166–167, para 466; Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) (Judgment) [2009] ICJ Reports 213, 267, para 150; Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures.³⁹ Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures.⁴⁰ General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility. In the LaGrand case, for instance, the ICJ highlighted that the ‘choice of means’ belonged to the responsible State.⁴¹ ³⁷ Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n³⁸ Tams (n 30) 85.\n³⁹ Palmisano (n 24) 773–774.\n⁴⁰ Barbier (n 23) 559.\n⁴¹ LaGrand (Judgment) (n 30), 513–514, para 125.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY Cessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation The Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held: It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.⁴² The well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases.⁴³ The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.⁴⁴ The obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute.⁴⁵ The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31(1) states that ‘[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁴⁶ ⁴² Factory at Chorzów (Jurisdiction) (1927) Series A, No 9 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 21.\n⁴³ Armed Activities (Judgment) (n 31) 257, para 259 (‘[t]he Court observes that it is well established in general international law that a State which bears responsibility for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by that act’); Avena (Judgment) (n 31) 59, para 119; Gabcikovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152.\n⁴⁴ Factory at Chorzów (Merits) (1928) Series A, No 17 Collection of Judgments (PCIJ) 47; reaffirmed in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 232, para 460.\n⁴⁵ Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (adopted 16 December 1920, entered into force 20 August 1921, 6 LNTS 379, 390, 114 BFSP 860, 17 AJIL Supp 115 (1923)), Article 36; Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945, 3 Bevans 1179, 59 Stat 1031, TS 993, 39 AJIL Supp 215 (1945)), Article 36.\n⁴⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION The responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.⁵¹ Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3). The last subsection analyses forms of reparation through the lens of the NotPetya case (9.3.5).\n## 9.3.1 Cyber Operations and the Notion of Injury The definition of what constitutes an ‘injury’ or ‘damage’ for the purposes of reparation is still a controversial question among international ⁴⁷ ibid, Article 33(1).\n⁴⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 112, commentary to Part Two, Chapter III, para 7; Brigitte Stern, ‘The Obligation to Make Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 568; regarding breaches of erga omnes obligations, the ICJ stated that all States might have a legal interest: Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application: 1962) (Judgment of Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Reports 3, 32, para 33 (‘In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes.’).\n⁴⁹ In some circumstances, individuals protected by the primary obligation that has been breached might also benefit from the obligation of reparation, notably when it comes to human rights obligations; see, for instance: Stern (n 48) 567; Susan Marks et al, ‘Responsibility for Violations of Human Rights Obligations’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 725–790.\n⁵⁰ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 568.\n⁵¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY lawyers.⁵² The debate focuses on what is the exact meaning and content of each term. James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’,⁵³ and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’.⁵⁴ Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’.⁵⁵ The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist.⁵⁶ The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁵⁷ Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.⁵⁸ ## 9.3.2 Causality The responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.⁵⁹ Thus, there must be a causal link between the injury and the internationally wrongful act attributed to the responsible State.⁶⁰ ⁵² James Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1093, para 27; Brigitte Stern argues that there is no difference between the terms ‘injury’ and ‘damage’: Stern (n 48) 569; see also Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485–492.\n⁵³ James Crawford, ‘Fourth Report on State Responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur’ (International Law Commission 2001) DOCUMENT A/CN.4/517 and Add.1, 9, para 33; Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’ (MPEPIL) (n 52) para 27; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485.\n⁵⁴ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(2).\n⁵⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n⁵⁶ See, generally, Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 266–267, paras 107–110.\n⁵⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁵⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 9; see, however, the critical analysis of the ILC Articles’ approach on causation in Stern (n 48) 569–570.\n⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n⁶⁰ See, generally: d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 622 et seq; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 492 et seq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION The reparation awarded to the injured State may be negatively affected by any wilful or negligent act, or omission, on the part of the injured State or of the person seeking reparation.⁶¹ To sum-up, a perpetrator State has an obligation to make reparation only if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, the occurrence of an injury, and secondly, there must be a causal link between this injury and the internationally wrongful act.⁶² Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate The ‘duty to mitigate’⁶³ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility.⁶⁴ Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State.⁶⁵ This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation.⁶⁶ However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms: ⁶¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n⁶² Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* 220.\n⁶³ The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁴ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n⁶⁵ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n⁶⁶ Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY It would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.⁶⁷ To mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss.⁶⁸ It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ The following case exemplifies this position.\n⁶⁷ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n⁶⁸ The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n⁶⁹ On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION If we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the ⁷⁰ The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation. On Slammer, see, generally: Edward Ray, ‘Malware FAQ: MS-SQL Slammer’ (SANS) www.sans.org/security-resources/malwarefaq/ms-sql-exploit.php; ‘WORM:W32/SLAMMER’ (F-Secure) www.f-secure.com/v-descs/mssqlm.shtml; Paul Boutin, ‘Slammed!’, WIRED (1 July 2003) www.wired.com/2003/07/slammer/; Brent Kesler, ‘The Vulnerability of Nuclear Facilities to Cyber Attack’ (2010) 10 Strategic Insights 15, 19–20. See also the analysis in Georg Kerschischnig, Cyberthreats and International Law (Eleven International Publishing 2012) 51–52.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press fact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION To conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation The obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding: The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals – is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.⁷³ The primary form of reparation is restitution,⁷⁴ which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante.⁷⁵ Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate.⁷⁶ The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’.⁷⁷ Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused.⁷⁸ Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral ⁷³ Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n⁷⁴ Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v. Guinea) (Judgment) [1999] ITLOS Reports, para 170; Award on the Merits in Dispute between Texaco Overseas Petroleum Company/ California Asiatic Oil Company and the Government of the Libyan Arab Republic (Compensation for Nationalized Property) (1978) 17 International Legal Materials 1, 36, para 109; see also Gray (n 14) 589.\n⁷⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35 requests the re-establishment of ‘the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed’, which constitutes the narrowest understanding of restitution. A broader understanding of restitution would imply the (re) establishment of the situation, as it would have existed without the perpetration of the wrongful act: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 96, commentary to Article 35, para 2.\n⁷⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(1); as confirmed in the above extract from Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47; see, for instance, Affaire des biens britanniques au Maroc espagnol (Espagne contre Royaume-Uni) (1925) 2 RIAA 615, 621–625 and 651–742, in which compensation was considered after it was concluded that restitution was impossible.\n⁷⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36(2).\n⁷⁸ ibid, Article 37(1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION reparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.⁷⁹ Restitution, compensation and satisfaction are the only forms of reparation possible.⁸⁰ The three different forms of reparation may be invoked separately or in combination in order to satisfy the obligation of full reparation.⁸¹ For instance, in some circumstances restitution might be insufficient and thus complemented with compensation.⁸² In addition to the three exclusive forms of reparation – restitution, compensation and satisfaction, interest might be awarded either to ensure the full reparation as an element of reparation (pre-award interest) or in relation to the payment of the awarded sum (post-award interest).⁸³ The award of interest and its rate are determined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe obligation of reparation does have limits, however. For instance, the reparation, either made by restitution, compensation or satisfaction, should be proportionate to the loss suffered.⁸⁴ Moreover, if the injured State or person contributed to the injury, whether wilfully ⁷⁹ ibid, Article 37(2); the PCIJ did not refer to satisfaction in Chorzów (Merits) (n 44), 47, and mentioned only restitution and compensation as forms of reparation. Satisfaction has, however, been awarded in other cases, notably Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania) (Judgment on the Merits) [1949] ICJ Reports 435–436; see also Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122.\n⁸⁰ Yann Kerbrat, ‘Interaction Between the Forms of Reparation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 573.\n⁸¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\n⁸² Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47–48; The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) 65, para 170; Papamichalopoulos and Others v.

The superimposing of a penalty in addition to full compensation and naming it damages, with the qualifying word exemplary, vindictive, or punitive, is a hopeless confusion of terms, inevitably leading to confusion of thought.’; see also Loayza-Tamayo v. Peru (Reparations and Costs) (1998) Series C No 42 Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), 20, para 87 (‘[t]he reparations ordered in this Judgment must be proportionate to the violations [...]’). Accordingly, restitution should not ‘involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation’ (Article 35(b)); compensation ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage’ (Article 36); and finally, satisfaction ‘shall not be out of proportion to the injury’ (Article 37(3)).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY or negligently, this should be taken into account and limit the reparation.⁸⁵ After this brief presentation of the forms that reparation may take, the following subsections focus on each head of reparation – restitution (9.3.4.1), compensation (9.3.4.2) and satisfaction (9.3.4.3) – and analyse how they may be appropriate in the context of damage caused by cyber operations.\n## 9.3.4.1 Restitution Restitution is the first and principal form of reparation. It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached.⁸⁶ Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.⁸⁷ The two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice.⁸⁸ It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’⁸⁹ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.⁹⁰ In practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation.⁹¹ Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases. In the Temple of ⁸⁵ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39 ‘Contribution to the injury’ (‘In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’).\n⁸⁶ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11), commentary to Article 35, para 6; see also Gray (n 14) 594–595.\n⁸⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 35.\n⁸⁸ Gray (n 14) 590.\n⁸⁹ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 97, commentary to Article 35, para 5 (references omitted).\n⁹⁰ ibid; Gray (n 14) 590–591.\n⁹¹ Kerbrat (n 80) 584–586; Gray (n 14) 595–596.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION Preah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'.[92] In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution.[93] In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant',[94] which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State.[95] Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.[96] The possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY Iranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.⁹⁷ ⁹⁷ Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION In sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation Compensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate.⁹⁸ The customary international law principle of compensation⁹⁹ as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ,¹⁰⁰ and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁰¹ To be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’.¹⁰² In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation.¹⁰³ The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought: ⁹⁸ Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n⁹⁹ John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* 599.\n¹⁰⁰ *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n¹⁰¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n¹⁰² ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n¹⁰³ *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY Damage to the State as such might arise out of the shooting down of its aircraft or the sinking of its ships, attacks on its diplomatic premises and personnel, damage caused to other public property, the costs incurred in responding to pollution damage, or incidental damage arising, for example, out of the need to pay pensions and medical expenses for officials injured as the result of a wrongful act.¹⁰⁴ For instance, in the Corfu Channel case, the United Kingdom sought and obtained compensation under three different heads of damage: the replacement of the lost destroyer Saumarez; the damage sustained by the destroyer Volage; and the damage resulting from the deaths and injuries of naval personnel.¹⁰⁵ Moreover, compensation for personal injury has been dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as human rights bodies.¹⁰⁶ For instance, in the M/V 'Saiga' case, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) awarded compensation for damage suffered by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as well as for the personal damages of the crew.¹⁰⁷ The compensation awarded depends on the circumstances of the case, including the substance of the primary breached norm, the behaviour of the parties and the circumstances of the violation.¹⁰⁸ It is important to note that the standard of proof and the calculation of compensation are not developed in this research given their case-by-case nature.¹⁰⁹ Moreover, generally the burden of proof is on the claimant but this may be affected by the circumstances of the case. Like in any other legal dispute, courts, tribunals and arbitrators dealing with cases involving cyber operations will calculate the appropriate compensation according to the specific facts and circumstances of the case.¹¹⁰ The present subsection gives general guidelines on how to assess compensation when it comes to damage resulting from cyber operations.\n¹⁰⁴ 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 100, commentary to Article 36, para 8 (references omitted).\n¹⁰⁵ Corfu Channel (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v.

In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory.[113] This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart. As recently as 2014, Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (Bundesamt [111] 'Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility' (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n[112] d'Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 595.\n[113] See, generally, the description of the Aurora test in Kim Zetter, Countdown to Zero Day: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World's First Digital Weapon; see also Jeanne Meserve, 'Mouse Click Could Plunge City into Darkness, Experts Say' (CNN, 27 September 2007) http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/27/power.at.risk/index.html.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however.¹¹⁴ According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage.¹¹⁵ However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure¹¹⁶ may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.¹¹⁷ The physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation. The level of compensation will vary ¹¹⁴ ‘Die Lage der IT-Sicherheit in Deutschland 2014’ (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik 2014) 31.\n¹¹⁵ Kim Zetter, ‘A Cyberattack Has Caused Confirmed Physical Damage for the Second Time Ever’, WIRED (8 January 2015) www.wired.com/2015/01/german-steel-mill-hack-destruction/; Robert M Lee, Michael J Assante and Tim Conway, ‘German Steel Mill Cyber Attack’ (SANS, ICS CP/PE (Cyber-to-Physical or Process Effects) case study paper 2014) https://ics.sans.org/media/ICS-CPPE-case-Study-2-German-Steelworks_Facility.pdf; ‘ICS Cyber-Attack on German Steelworks Facility and Lessons Learned’ (Dragos Security, 18 December 2014) https://dragossecurity.com/blog/9-ics-cyber-attack-on-german-steelworks-facility-and-lessons-learned.\n¹¹⁶ On critical infrastructures, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n¹¹⁷ This proposition is developed in the section on satisfaction; see infra 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION (ii) Non-physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Most cyber operations produce non-physical damage, such as the alteration or destruction of data or making data inaccessible. Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data.¹¹⁹ The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems.¹²⁰ No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere ¹¹⁸ Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n¹¹⁹ Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n¹²⁰ Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY distress over having temporarily lost access to the Internet or losing personal e-correspondance that lacks pecuniary impact does not qualify as material damage.¹²¹ (iii) Compensation for the Cost Resulting from the Removal of a Malware The removal of a malware from a computer system may entail significant costs for the victim State or private actors. In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory.¹²² The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area.¹²³ Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.¹²⁴ Similar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable.¹²⁵ Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.¹²⁶ In ¹²¹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 1) 144–145, commentary to Rule 28, para 2.\n¹²² ‘Claim against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by Soviet Cosmos 954’ (n 121) 899–930.\n¹²³ ibid 903–904, para 8.\n¹²⁴ ‘Protocol in Respect of the Claim for Damages Caused by the Satellite “Cosmos 954”.

For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner.¹²⁹ During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler.¹³⁰ This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation. As part of the cyber to Article 36, para 1 ('[t]he qualification\"financially assessable\"is intended to exclude compensation for what is sometimes referred to as\"moral damage\"to a State [...]'); the Commentary, however, acknowledges the solution adopted in the Rainbow Warrior case: ibid 92, commentary to Article 31, para 7.\n¹²⁷ Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

For instance, the services of Hansapank and SEB Eesti Ühispank, the main commercial banks of Estonia, were rendered unavailable for an hour and a half on 9 May and 15 May respectively.¹³¹ Similarly, the cyber operations against Lithuania and Georgia in 2008 targeted and affected privately owned websites and servers.¹³² In such cases, compensation appears to be the most appropriate means to repair the injury suffered.\nIn conclusion, it must be noted that the damage, whether physical or non-physical, caused by a cyber operation may often be financially assessable and thus compensation would constitute the main form of reparation in these cases.\n## 9.3.4.3 Satisfaction Satisfaction is the third and last form of reparation available when the damage cannot be fully repaired by restitution or compensation.¹³³ Satisfaction is primarily used for damages that are not assessable financially and that cannot be compensated, which is generally the case concerning moral and legal damage.¹³⁴ The commentary to Article 37 of the Articles on State Responsibility gives several examples of such damage: State practice also provides many instances of claims for satisfaction in circumstances where the internationally wrongful act of a State causes non-material injury to another State. Examples include situations of insults to the symbols of the State, such as the national flag, violations ¹³¹ Eneken Tikk, Kadri Kaska and Liis Vihul, *International Cyber Incidents: Legal Considerations* (NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) 2010) 19–20 www.ccdcoe.org/publications/books/legalconsiderations.pdf.\n¹³² Danchev (n 130); ‘Lithuania: Attacks Focused on Hosting Company’ (PCWorld, 4 July 2008) www.pcworld.com/article/147960/article.html.\n¹³³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(1) (“The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused by that act insofar as it cannot be made good by restitution or compensation.”).\n¹³⁴ Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 272–273, para 122 (“There is a long established practice of States and international Courts and Tribunals of using satisfaction as a remedy or form of reparation [in the wide sense] for the breach of an international obligation. This practice relates particularly to the case of moral or legal damage done directly to the State, especially as opposed to the case of damage to persons involving international responsibilities.”). See also: Bernard Graefrath, ‘Responsibility and Damages Caused: Relationship between Responsibility and Damages’ (1984) 185 RCADI 9, 69, 84; Capotorti (n 8) 266.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION Satisfaction may include non-material or moral reparation, such as an apology, expression of regret or acknowledgement of the breach.¹³⁶ Moreover, there are limits to reparation by satisfaction as it should not be disproportionate or humiliate the State responsible for the damage.¹³⁷ This study intends to determine when satisfaction can be awarded for the injury resulting from cyber operations. The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.¹³⁸ Given that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose. Firstly, it could act as a sign that the responsible State is willing to terminate ¹³⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 4 (footnotes omitted).\n¹³⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 37(2); the list of forms of satisfaction given in Article 37(2) is not exhaustive: ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 106, commentary to Article 37, para 5; on the possible forms of satisfaction see, generally, ibid 106–107, paras 5–7, commentary under Article 37; see also Eric Wyler and Alain Papaux, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Satisfaction’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 629–634.\n¹³⁷ Bernard Graefrath lists some examples of misuses of satisfaction as a means to humiliate foreign States and peoples: Graefrath (n 134) 85–86.\n¹³⁸ Corfu Channel (Merits) (n 79) 35–36; Rainbow Warrior (n 9).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY its wrongful conduct and to surrender the information and any potential advantage it could obtain from the stolen data. Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^[139]^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation This section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya 'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^[140]^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^[141]^ https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION Consequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million.¹⁴² According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered: ‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n¹⁴² Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v. Zurich American Insurance Company (Defendant) Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois 2018-L-011008.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY By a letter dated 1 June 2018, Zurich American Insurance denied coverage of the losses of Mondelēz International based on exclusion B.2 (a) of the insurance policy: B. This Policy excludes loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from [...]\n\n(i) government or sovereign power (de jure or de facto); (ii) military, naval, or air force; or (iii) agent or authority of any party specified in i or ii above.\nThe case (2018-L-011008) is still pending, and we have to wait and see whether the US justice system will confirm the interpretation of NotPetya made by Zurich American Insurance.\nSimilarly, in the United Kingdom, the insurer Hiscox appears to have refused to cover the losses related to NotPetya suffered by the law firm DLA Piper, most likely because of the ‘war exclusion’ of its insurance policy.^[143]^ These two cases show how the public attribution made by some States may have consequences for the potential of private companies within these countries to recover the losses they suffered as a result of notPetya from their insurance companies.\n## 9.4 Shared Responsibility In some circumstances, more than one State may be responsible for the injury suffered by the victim State.^[144]^ Two situations involving multiple States that are responsible for an injury can be distinguished.^[145]^ On the one hand, the States responsible may have committed different ^[143]^ Tabby Kinder, ‘Companies at Risk as Hiscox Rules out DLA Piper’s Cyberattack Claim’, *The Times* (25 March 2019) www.thetimes.co.uk/article/companies-at-risk-as-insurer-rules-out-cyberattack-claim-2psj2jbz0.\n^[144]^ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.

Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State.¹⁴⁷ Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States In the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury.¹⁴⁸ A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’¹⁴⁹ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B.¹⁵⁰ Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the ¹⁴⁶ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n¹⁴⁷ ibid 232 et seq.\n¹⁴⁸ ibid 222.\n¹⁴⁹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n¹⁵⁰ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press STATE RESPONSIBILITY consequences of its own acts.¹⁵¹ Conversely, in the case of cumulative wrongful acts, each act taken separately did not cause an injury and only their accumulation created the condition necessary to cause the injury suffered by the victim State. Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.¹⁵² Such a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States In the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible¹⁵³ and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately.¹⁵⁴ The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.¹⁵⁵ Stuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n¹⁵¹ ibid 224–227.\n¹⁵² ibid 227–232.\n¹⁵³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n¹⁵⁴ Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia) (Judgment on the Preliminary Objections) [1992] ICJ Reports 240, 258–259, para 48.\n¹⁵⁵ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 237–241.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press SHARED RESPONSIBILITY The joint commission of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms and the participation of each State may not have the same impact. In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself.¹⁵⁶ The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C.¹⁵⁷ In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal ¹⁵⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16. See also Christian Dominicé, ‘Attribution of Conduct to Multiple States and the Implication of a State in the Act of Another State’ in Alain Pellet et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility 281–289; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 333 et seq.\n¹⁵⁷ On organs placed at the disposal of another State, see supra 4.1.3 Organs Placed at the Disposal of Another State.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press regime governing how to deal with each form of assistance. In some cases, the assisting State will be responsible only for the aid that it provided. In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility States may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS This chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State.¹⁵⁹ This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n¹⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press"

Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nOBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n383\nThe obligation of cessation has been confirmed by the ICJ in various cases.¹⁰ As noted by the ILC in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, ‘[t]he function of cessation is to put an end to a violation of international law and to safeguard the continuing validity and effectiveness of the underlying primary rule. The responsible State’s obligation of cessation thus protects both the interests of the injured State or States and the interests of the international community as a whole in the preservation of, and reliance on, the rule of law.’¹¹ In practice, cessation may be requested not only by the injured State, but also by other subjects of international law, most notably the General Assembly or Security Council of the United Nations.¹²\nCessation is generally but not unanimously recognised as an independent obligation.

WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n421",

    "9\n\n# State Responsibility and the Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Cyber Operation\n\nThe existence of secondary rules of responsibility stems from two cumulative elements: a breach of an international obligation and the attribution of this breach to a State.¹ Thus, responsibility arises without its invocation by an injured State, as clearly stated by Article 1 of the Articles on State Responsibility:\n\nEvery internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that State.²\n\nAs a consequence of an internationally wrongful act, the wrongdoing State bears an obligation of cessation, non-repetition and reparation of the wrongful act.³ These consequences are automatic and do not depend on any action by the injured State.\n\nThe injured State is entitled to invoke the responsibility of another State (the responsible State) for its conduct, or omission, if the latter breaches an obligation owed to the former on an individual basis. A State may also be entitled to invoke the responsibility of another if the obligation is owed to a group of States including the injured State or the international community as a whole, and either specially affects that State or 'is of such a character as radically to change the position of all\n\n¹ The Tallinn Manual 2.0 prescribes that ‘[a] State bears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the State and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation’: Michael N Schmitt and Liis Vihul (eds), Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations (2nd edn, CUP 2017) 84, Rule 14.\n\n² Articles on ‘Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts’ (adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001, annexed to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by Document A/56/49 (Vol I)/Corr4), Article 1.\n\n³ These obligations are analysed in Rules 27, 28 and 29 of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 (n 1) 142–151. The approach adopted by the Manual is mainly based on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility, as is also the case in the present book.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

If cessation or reparation are denied by the responsible State, the injured State may take countermeasures to compel the responsible State to comply with its obligations. The invocation of responsibility is beyond the scope of this book and is not developed any further. Conversely, countermeasures are discussed in Chapter 10, together with other measures of self-help.\n\nThe present chapter analyses the obligations owed by the State responsible for a cyber operation against another State: firstly, if the cyber operation has a continuing character, the responsible State is under obligation to cease the operation (9.1). Secondly, the responsible State may have to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition if required by the circumstances of the case (9.2). Thirdly, the responsible State has to repair the injury resulting from the cyber operation (9.3). Finally, it is necessary to examine the question of shared responsibility, which is applicable when multiple States are involved in the cyber operation (9.4).\n\n## 9.1 Obligation of Cessation\n\nA State responsible for a wrongful cyber operation having a continuing character bears the obligation to cease. Indeed, a State perpetrating an internationally wrongful act without valid legal authority is bound to immediately terminate the violation of the international law norm. This obligation is the direct consequence of the wrongful conduct, and exists even without any request or action by the injured State. Cessation of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms depending on the nature of the act, and may consist either in abstaining from certain conducts – for example, ending its support to an armed group fighting against another State, or in performing a specific action – for instance, releasing hostages.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

It is important to highlight that in most cases the wrongful cyber operations will continue to breach the international obligation as long as they last. It is not only the launching of a cyber operation that constitutes, for instance, a violation of the principle of sovereignty or non-intervention or the prohibition of the use of force.\n\n## 9.1.1 The Obligation of Cessation in the Event of a Distributed Denial of Service Attack\n\nDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks generally attempt to make an online service unavailable, or cause a disruption by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. The attribution of DDoS attacks is a difficult exercise, as they are generally conducted by several perpetrators simultaneously, sometimes also relying on intermediary systems to advance and amplify their attacks.\n\nIn 2007, for instance, Estonia was targeted by a wave of DDoS attacks that caused several websites and communications systems to malfunction and which apparently came from countries all over the world. Similarly, the 2008 DDoS attacks against Georgia, coinciding with the Russo-Georgian war, had similar effects and were apparently launched from multiple locations.\n\nDDoS attacks usually have a continuing character, as their effects will last as long as the attack is perpetrated and will end with it. Thus, as soon as the DDoS attack crosses the threshold of legality, the responsible State, or the partially responsible State when there are multiple perpetrators, automatically and instantaneously bears the obligation to cease. The responsible State is subject to the obligation to cease its DDoS attack on the targeted State, even if the latter has neither identified the attack and its perpetrator, nor has taken any action.\n\n¹⁸ Deman (n 7) 480–483; ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 3; see the analysis of what constitutes a ‘violation of an obligation on a series of occasions’ in Crawford, *State Responsibility* (n 14) 462–463.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\n## 9.1.2 The Obligation of Cessation Regarding the Intrusion of a Malware\n\nThe intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State constitutes another interesting case regarding the obligation of cessation. Generally, as asserted previously in this book, the intrusion of a malware into the computer system of another State violates the territorial sovereignty of the targeted State.¹⁹ The intruded malware may serve various purposes and actions: it may constitute a back door and remain dormant until its creators decide to use it; it may spy on the infected system; or it may lead to the malfunction of the infected system producing various kinds of effects. As long as the malware is present in the infected system, whether operating or ready to operate for its creator, it unequivocally constitutes a continuing internationally wrongful act. Thus, the obligation of cessation applies.\n\nThe question arises as to what the obligation of cessation implies. Does it imply the removal of the malware by the perpetrator or the victim? Or, simply, ending the communication and thus the control of the perpetrator? The specific nature of cyber operations makes interpreting the obligation of cessation challenging and this requires some creativity and flexibility. Firstly, it is the presence of the malware in the victim system that constitutes the breach of territorial sovereignty and not only its use. Secondly, when an aircraft, a ship or an agent violates the territorial sovereignty of a State, its exit from the area under the territorial sovereignty of the injured State constitutes the end of the violation. The situation is different in the cyber context, however. The malware does not have to 'exit' but it needs to be deleted from the system of the victim. Thirdly, it makes no sense for the victim to grant the perpetrator additional access to its system in order to remove the malware.\n\nThe obligation of cessation in the case of the intrusion of a malware is a reminder of the above-mentioned debate over the distinction between the obligation of cessation and the obligation of *restitutio in integrum*, and more generally of reparation.²⁰ The removal of the malware from the infected system is likely to constitute both the cessation and the reparation, as the targeted system may then recover to its pre-infection situation. However, I contend that cessation should be understood more broadly and encompasses situations in which the malware has not yet\n\n¹⁹ See supra 5.3.2.2 Cyber Operations Penetrating a Foreign System.\n²⁰ See infra 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "OBLIGATION OF CESSATION\n387\n\nbeen removed from the infected system. I propose two cumulative criteria to identify the compliance of the responsible State with its obligation of cessation concerning the malware infection: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator. The malware would then become a dormant piece of code lost in the targeted system. Secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information to the targeted State for the complete and definitive removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. This implies the communication of the exploited vulnerabilities in the targeted system. Thus, cessation would not equate to re-establishing the status quo ante, as would be the case in restitutio in integrum, but would furnish the injured State with all the necessary information to re-establish the status quo ante. It would also give the injured State the chance to update its system and remove the vulnerability exploited by the intruders – and thus prevent further possible intrusions through this same vulnerability.\n\nThe two criteria are cumulative. For instance, in the case of a malware seeking to spy on the system and its user, simply ending any communication and the use of the malware do not suffice. The malware will remain dormant in the targeted system, and will continue to constitute a violation of the infected system. Providing all the information required for the removal of the malware will not by itself stop the intrusion. The victim will have to take active steps within the targeted system to remove the infection. It seems then sufficient to argue that the perpetrator creates the necessary conditions in order to end the violation of the breached norm of international law.\n\nThis approach differs from the current state of international law. Indeed, as long as the malware is present in the infected system, even if dormant and useless, it constitutes a violation of territorial sovereignty. Thus, the wrongful act has not ceased and the obligation of cessation is still pending. A parallel can be drawn with the ruling of the ICJ in the Wall Advisory Opinion, in which the Court concluded that the obligation of cessation imposes three conditions: firstly, the halting of the construction of the wall; secondly, the dismantling of the existing structure; and thirdly, repealing or rendering ineffective all legislative and regulatory acts related to the construction of the wall.²¹ The shift into the\n\n²¹ Wall (Advisory Opinion) (n 10) 201, para 163 (3) B. On the question of cessation in the Wall Advisory Opinion, see generally Pierre d'Argent, ‘Compliance, Cessation, Reparation and Restitution in the Wall Advisory Opinion’ in Malcolm N Shaw et al (eds),\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\ncyber realm challenges this approach, however. Indeed, requiring the removal of the malware by the perpetrator would allow it to gain further access to the infected system and thus to learn more about it. Moreover, the action performed by the perpetrator in order to remove its malware may produce additional damage to the system. It is thus preferable that the legitimate owner of the system performs the removal of the malware. For these reasons, I argue that the obligation of cessation should not depend on the removal of the malware by the perpetrator, but preferably should impose an obligation on the perpetrator to transmit all the information necessary to remove the malware. This proposition is not de lege feranda, remaining within the limits of positive international law, as this interpretation is compatible with the current content of the obligation of cessation.\n\n## 9.1.3 Concluding Remarks on the Obligation of Cessation\n\nVarious forms of cyber operation may have a continuing character, thus constituting a continuing wrongful act. In such cases, as soon as the cyber operation breaches a norm of international law and as long as it continues, the perpetrating State bears an obligation to cease the cyber operation.\n\n## 9.2 Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition\n\nThe responsible State may have to offer appropriate assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if the circumstances require.²² Thus, conversely to the obligation of cessation, it is not an automatic and systematic consequence of a wrongful act and it depends on the circumstances of the case.²³\n\nThe obligation to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition can sometimes be confused with satisfaction, which is a form of\n\nVölkerrecht als Wertordnung/Common Values in International Law: Festschrift für Christian Tomuschat/Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat (NP Engel Verlag 2006) 467–473.\n\n²² Articles on State Responsibility, Article 30 (b).\n²³ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 91, commentary to Article 30, para 13; see, generally: Sandrine Barbier, ‘Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in James Crawford et al (eds), The Law of International Responsibility (OUP 2010) 557–559; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 469.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

By contrast, assurances and guarantees of non-repetition are forward-looking and aim at preventing the perpetration of future violations.²⁶ Assurances and guarantees aim at restoring ‘confidence in a continuing relationship’ between the injured State and the responsible State.²⁷ In any case, the two obligations may merge in certain circumstances, notably if the injured State requires assurances and guarantees of non-repetition as a form of satisfaction.²⁸\n\nIn 2001 in the LaGrand case, the ICJ ordered, for the first time,²⁹ the responsible State to provide guarantees and assurances of non-repetition.³⁰ This has been reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence,³¹ and the Court has confirmed that the obligation applies only if required:\n\n²⁴ Capotorti (n 8) 266; Giuseppe Palmisano, ‘Les garanties de non-répétition entre codification et réalisation jurisdictionnelle du droit: à propos de l'affaire LaGrand’ (2002) 106 Revue Générale de Droit International Public 753, 781–784; Barbier (n 23) 555–556.\n\n²⁵ Christian J Tams, ‘Recognizing Guarantees and Assurances of Non-repetition: LaGrand and the Law of State Responsibility’ (2002) 27 Yale Journal of International Law 441, 443.\n\n²⁶ d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 678–679; see also Palmisano (n 24) 784.\n\n²⁷ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 89, commentary to Article 30, para 9.\n\n²⁸ ibid 90, commentary to Article 30, para 11.\n\n²⁹ However, the assurances and guarantees of non-repetition had already been argued before the Court as a consequence of an unlawful act in earlier cases: Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia) (Judgment) [1997] ICJ Reports 7, 74–75, paras 127 and 129; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\n[W]hile the Court may order, as it has done in the past, a State responsible for internationally wrongful conduct to provide the injured State with assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, it will only do so if the circumstances so warrant, which it is for the Court to assess.\n\nAs a general rule, there is no reason to suppose that a State whose act or conduct has been declared wrongful by the Court will repeat that act or conduct in the future, since its good faith must be presumed (see Factory at Chorzów, Merits, Judgment No. 13, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 63; Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 272, para. 60; Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment, I.C.J.

Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101). There is thus no reason, except in special circumstances of which the Court is not aware in the present case, to order [the provision of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition] such as that requested by Costa Rica.³²\n\nThe responsible State would therefore have to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition only when necessary. In the LaGrand case, the United States committed an internationally wrongful act because it prevented Germany from exercising its consular functions and diplomatic protection³³ in relation to two German citizens who had been sentenced to death and were subsequently executed by the United States. The ICJ ruled that the satisfaction, in the form of formal apologies, was insufficient and that the United States had to offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition of such acts in the future.³⁴\n\nThe difficulty is in identifying the circumstances that require an offer of assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. In actual fact, such an offer is exceptional and not automatic, conceded only if the circumstances require such assurances and guarantees.³⁵ Three factors can be identified in making this assessment: the risk of repetition, the seriousness of the breach and the character of the breached obligation.³⁶ The\n\n166–167, para 466; Dispute regarding Navigational and Related Rights (Costa Rica v.

States may be tempted to resort to cyber operations and repeat these actions time and again so long as their lawfulness remains open to question. This constitutes a current and future risk of occurrence and repetition of such conduct. Thus, international courts and tribunals, as well as some States, may request guarantees and assurances of non-repetition regarding specific cyber operations to clarify and substantiate the unlawful character of these operations. This may be particularly interesting in the case of a large-scale DDoS attack, when the legal qualification may be controversial. In my judgement, requiring guarantees and assurances of non-repetition against such forms of cyber operations may help settle the question of their unlawfulness under international law.\n\nGuarantees and assurances of non-repetition may take various forms, including: a vague verbal commitment not to repeat the wrongful conduct; a commitment to take specific measures to prevent the same wrongful conduct occurring if the same conditions arose in the future; and immediate and concrete measures.³⁹ Moreover, the content of these measures concerning a specific type of conduct can be divided into two main categories: general measures and specific measures.⁴⁰ General measures amount to a commitment by the responsible State that it will not commit the same wrongful act again, without any specification of these measures. Conversely, specific measures consist of measures aimed at ensuring that this type of wrongful act will not be perpetrated again. In the cyber context, for instance, specific measures could mean requiring the responsible State to amend its national cyber policy for the purpose of integrating the prohibition of cyber operations that breach international law norms. The obligation may be performed in various ways and should be considered with a certain degree of flexibility.

    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nCessation, and assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, are sometimes confused with reparation, despite the logic and preference to distinguish them in the majority of cases. Having developed these two obligations, it is necessary to turn to the obligation to make full reparation.\n\n## 9.3 Obligation of Making Reparation\n\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice, in the Factory at Chorzów case, clearly affirmed that a breach of a primary obligation gives rise to a secondary obligation to make reparation for the resulting injury. The Court held:\n\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form.⁴²\n\nThe well-established obligation to make full reparation has since been reaffirmed and clarified by the ICJ in several cases.⁴³ The objective of reparation is to ‘so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed’.⁴⁴\n\nThe obligation of reparation as a legal consequence of a breach of an international obligation was recognised in Article 36 of the PCIJ Statute, which was restated in Article 36 of the ICJ Statute.⁴⁵ The obligation to make reparation has been codified by the ILC in the Articles on State Responsibility.

    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n393\n\nDepending on the circumstances and the nature of the breached obligation, the obligations of the responsible State may be owed to one or more States, as well as to the international community as a whole.⁴⁷ The obligation owed by the responsible State extends to other States, and not just the injured State, in the case of a breach of an obligation owed to a group of States (erga omnes partes obligations), or extends to all States for a breach of an obligation to the international community as a whole (erga omnes obligations).⁴⁸ Conversely, only the injured State can benefit from the obligation to make full reparation.⁴⁹ For instance, a State breaching the prohibition on recourse to force may have its responsibility invoked by any State, as it is violating an erga omnes obligation. However, only the injured State may be entitled to request the reparation of the injury suffered.⁵⁰\n\nThe responsible State is obliged to make full reparation to the injured State for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.⁵¹ Thus, before analysing the forms of reparation (9.3.4), it is necessary to define what constitutes an injury (9.3.1) and the necessary causal link between the wrongful act and the injury (9.3.2) and the duty to mitigate (9.3.3).

James Crawford summarised the problem by highlighting that damage may in some cases be the ‘gist of injury’,⁵³ and in others not. Moreover, it is possible to suffer damage without wrongful conduct (damnum sine iniuria). The ILC adopted an inclusive approach. Article 31 (2) reads: ‘[i]njury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’.⁵⁴ Accordingly, damage can be either material or moral. ‘Material damage’ consists of damage to property or other interests, which is assessable in financial terms, and is caused to a State or its nationals. ‘Moral damage’ includes such items as individual pain and suffering, loss of loved ones or personal affront associated with an intrusion on one’s home or private life’.⁵⁵ The damage does not, in fact, need to be physical in order to exist.⁵⁶ The reparation of the damage is possible only if the damage is ‘caused by the internationally wrongful act’.⁵⁷ Thus, there must be a causal link between the wrongful act and the injury, which means that not all damage will be covered.⁵⁸\n\n## 9.3.2 Causality\n\nThe responsible State is only under an obligation to make full reparation for injury ‘caused’ by one of its internationally wrongful acts.⁵⁹ Thus, there must be a causal link between the injury and the internationally wrongful act attributed to the responsible State.⁶⁰\n\n⁵² James Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’, Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law (MPEPIL) (OUP 2006) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1093, para 27; Brigitte Stern argues that there is no difference between the terms ‘injury’ and ‘damage’: Stern (n 48) 569; see also Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485–492.\n\n⁵³ James Crawford, ‘Fourth Report on State Responsibility, by Mr. James Crawford, Special Rapporteur’ (International Law Commission 2001) DOCUMENT A/CN.4/517 and Add.1, 9, para 33; Crawford, ‘State Responsibility’ (MPEPIL) (n 52) para 27; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 485.\n\n⁵⁴ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(2).\n\n⁵⁵ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 5.\n\n⁵⁶ See, generally, Rainbow Warrior (n 9), 266–267, paras 107–110.\n\n⁵⁷ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n\n⁵⁸ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 92, commentary to Article 31, para 9; see, however, the critical analysis of the ILC Articles’ approach on causation in Stern (n 48) 569–570.\n\n⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 31(1).\n\n⁶⁰ See, generally: d’Argent, Les réparations de guerre en droit international public (n 13) 622 et seq; Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 492 et seq.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nThe reparation awarded to the injured State may be negatively affected by any wilful or negligent act, or omission, on the part of the injured State or of the person seeking reparation.⁶¹\n\nTo sum-up, a perpetrator State has an obligation to make reparation only if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, the occurrence of an injury, and secondly, there must be a causal link between this injury and the internationally wrongful act.⁶² Only if these two elements are met is the injured State entitled to request the reparation for the damage caused. The link between the cyber operation and the damage caused may be affected by the behaviour of the victim State. In light of this, it may lead the reader to ask whether the injured State bears an obligation to mitigate the damage. In other words, it seems that the injured State could be under a ‘duty to mitigate’.\n\n## 9.3.3 The Duty to Mitigate\n\nThe ‘duty to mitigate’⁶³ is not an obligation that gives rise to responsibility.⁶⁴ Furthermore, it could not be used to justify another internationally wrongful act owing to the negligence of a State.⁶⁵ This duty can, however, affect and moderate the responsible State’s obligation to make reparation.⁶⁶ However, it only provides a basis for the calculation of damage and the determination of the appropriate reparation. In the Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros Project case the ICJ defined the duty to mitigate in the following terms:\n\n⁶¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 39.\n\n⁶² Brigitte Stern, *Le préjudice dans la théorie de la responsabilité internationale* (Pedone 1973) 382; d’Argent, *Les réparations de guerre en droit international public* (n 13) 564; Jean Combacau and Serge Sur, *Droit international public* (7th edn, Montchrestien 2006) 528–530; Stern (n 48) 569–570; Pierre d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ in Andre Nollkaemper and Ilias Plakokefalos (eds), *Principles of Shared Responsibility in International Law: An Appraisal of the State of the Art* (CUP 2014) 220.\n\n⁶³ The injured State’s duty to mitigate should not be confused with the principle of due diligence applying to State in the perpetration of their cyber operation, which includes a duty to mitigate the effects of cyber operations toward third States. On due diligence, see supra Chapter 8.\n\n⁶⁴ ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 93, commentary to Article 31, para 11.\n\n⁶⁵ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, para 80.\n\n⁶⁶ Stephan Wittich, ‘Compensation’, *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (MPEPIL) (2008) https://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e1025, para 21.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIt would follow from such a principle [of mitigation] that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.⁶⁷\n\nTo mitigate damage means reducing the loss or injury that results from the internationally wrongful conduct; the injured State is duty-bound to take all reasonable measures to mitigate its loss.⁶⁸ It is important to note that it is a best-efforts obligation but not an obligation of result; the victim State has no obligation to successfully repel a cyber operation targeting its system. It must, however, take any necessary measures to limit the effects of the cyber operation.\n\nThe duty to mitigate is of particular interest in the cyber context. It can have two dimensions in this realm: firstly, a general duty to implement robust cyber security systems to protect the critical infrastructure of the State; secondly, the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation on a computer system. Both of these are specific in nature, although the second dimension is simply a general duty to mitigate but transposed to the cyber realm.\n\nHowever, the first dimension is unique owing to the specificity of cyberspace. Cybersecurity is an important challenge for States and private companies, and they are constantly working on ways to improve the security of their systems and networks. One of the main measures is to regularly update the systems in order to ensure that they are protected against known vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are frequently discovered and exposed which requires system updating, thereby eliminating any vulnerabilities. Thus, if the malware used by a state-sponsored cyber operation infected the system via a known vulnerability, which should have been removed in advance, it can be argued that the owner of the system failed in its duty to mitigate. This would not prevent the injured State from seeking reparation, but it might be used as a ground to lower the award of compensation. In the same way, poor cyber security choices may be a factor used against the injured State when calculating the level of compensation, especially when it concerns critical infrastructure.⁶⁹ The following case exemplifies this position.\n\n⁶⁷ Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros (Judgment) (n 29) 55, paras 80–81.\n\n⁶⁸ The duty to mitigate must be distinguished from the duty of diligence previously analysed in this book; on the latter see supra Chapter 8.\n\n⁶⁹ On critical infrastructure, see supra 6.1.6 Cyber Operations Targeting Critical Infrastructure.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n397\n\nOn 25 January 2003, the Slammer worm⁷⁰ infected thousands of servers worldwide in less than fifteen minutes by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server. Slammer led to significant disruptive effects, such as slowing down and disrupting Internet connection in several countries, shutting down thousands of Bank of America’s ATMs and blocking the ticketing system of Continental Airlines, forcing the company to cancel several flights. The objective of the worm, however, was to infect the system memory and from there to search for other hosts to infect; it did not take control of the system or affect the data stored on the hard drive. The removal of the worm was an easy procedure, which entailed closing the point of entry used by Slammer, port 1434, and rebooting the server. Servers not yet infected could prevent the infection by closing their port 1434. Slammer also infected the computer system of the Davis-Besse nuclear power plant in the United States, causing disruption to the normal functioning of the Safety Parameter Display System. It is hoped that the infection of the nuclear plant system did not produce any long-term damage. The computer systems of the nuclear plant were protected by a firewall and should not have been vulnerable to Slammer. However, the worm was able to bypass the firewall because a consultant had created a connection behind the firewall between the network of the nuclear plant and the network of his office. In response to this incident, a firewall has been established between the two networks.\n\nIf we consider a similar scenario where a comparable malware is created and launched by a State, the injured State could ask, inter alia, for compensation on behalf of the company running the nuclear plant. The compensation would be for the loss of reputation resulting from the malfunctioning of the nuclear plant as well as for the cost of restoring a clean and safe computer system. The responsible State could argue that the injured State had failed to meet its obligation to mitigate on two grounds. The first ground is due to the unsecure connection established between the nuclear plant’s network and the consultant’s network. Thus, the nuclear plant was not fully protected. The second ground rests on the\n\n⁷⁰ The Slammer worm was not a state-sponsored cyber operation and is used here only as an example of a cyber operation.

    "fact that as soon as the vulnerability was known, the system should have been updated so as to protect it against the malware. These two grounds are very fragile and it is not certain if they would be successful. Nonetheless, they are plausible and could be used in future to make a case that the injured party failed to mitigate its loss.\n\nWannaCry and NotPetya used exploits based on vulnerabilities that were already known about and patched by Microsoft several months before these malwares started to operate. Thus, a large number of the victims were actually vulnerable because they were not up to date. Several States publicly attributed WannaCry and NotPetya respectively to North Korea and Russia, without going further on the lawfulness of these malware campaigns nor on the responsibility of the perpetrating States. However, if the victim States in each case had invoked the responsibility of the perpetrating State and its obligation to make reparation for the caused damage, the perpetrating State could have argued that the injured States failed to implement their duty to mitigate. It would have been a very fragile but plausible argument to raise in opposition to the invocation of the obligation to make reparation. This argument would, however, have had little chance of success in being of any consequence if it had been employed against the obligation of reparation of the perpetrating State.\n\nThe duty to mitigate is theoretically easy to conceptualise, but might result in very complex situations in practice. In most cases, cyber infrastructures are not directly owned or managed by the State but are in the hands of private entities. Hence, it is natural to ask: what is the extent of the duty of the State in the case of a privately owned infrastructure? Take, for instance, the case of a cyber operation by State A targeting and causing physical damage to a factory belonging to the company C and located on the territory of State B. The physical damage caused to the factory could have been avoided, or at least largely reduced, if the computer system of the factory was up to date (for example, a patch was available against the vulnerability that could infect the system). In such situations, is State B's duty to mitigate affected by the private actor's lack of robust cyber security? A positive answer seems somewhat far-fetched. A State cannot be held responsible when a private actor has not installed robust cyber security. Maybe the State's lack of incentives to encourage its companies to take such cyber threats seriously could be taken into consideration. For instance, absence of regulatory or legislative",
    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n399\n\nmeasures imposing the implementation of robust cyber security for sensitive infrastructure detracts from the responsibility of private companies and focuses on the State. However, such duty seems to impose a disproportionate burden on the State. Thus, the duty to implement robust cybersecurity may not be practicable in practice, especially as it can only directly apply to state-owned cyber infrastructures. Concerning the duty to take necessary measures to mitigate the effects of an ongoing cyber operation, the same considerations also apply. It would be disproportionate to hold a State responsible for deficient cyber security of private actors. Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur – in other words ‘nobody is held to the impossible’ – justifies the limitation of the duty of mitigation when a State is not in a position to comply. These proposals on the interpretation of the duty to mitigate in the cyber context may be confirmed or discarded by future State practice. It is likely that States will confirm that the duty to mitigate applies in cyberspace, and their practice will define the limitations of this duty.\n\nTo conclude, it must be remembered that the duty to mitigate is not an absolute duty. Nonetheless, the behaviour of the injured State may be taken into account in the assessment of reparation owed by the responsible State. A State cannot bear responsibility because it fails to implement robust cyber security, or because it fails to take appropriate measures to mitigate the effects of a cyber operation. Such failure or negligence may, however, be taken into account in the assessment of damages and the calculations of reparation owed by the responsible State. Finally, it was also demonstrated in this subsection how the duty to mitigate can be extremely difficult to apply to real situations due to the complex structures of computer systems and networks.\n\n## 9.3.4 The Different Forms of Reparation\n\nThe obligation to make full reparation of the injury resulting from an internationally wrongful act may take three forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction.72 The PCIJ detailed the obligations of reparation, and two forms it may take – restitution and compensation, when addressing the merits of the case in Factory at Chorzów, holding:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act – a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in\n\n72 Articles on State Responsibility, Article 34.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it – such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.⁷³\n\nThe primary form of reparation is restitution,⁷⁴ which consists of the re-establishment of the status quo ante.⁷⁵ Restitution might, however, be restricted when materially impossible or when the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from restitution. When restitution is impossible or insufficient to ensure full reparation, the responsible State has an obligation to compensate.⁷⁶ The obligation to compensate consists in the payment of financial compensation that ‘shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established’.⁷⁷ Finally, if full reparation cannot be achieved through restitution and compensation, the responsible State is under an obligation to give satisfaction for the injury caused.⁷⁸ Satisfaction, the last form of reparation, may be constituted by non-material or moral\n\n⁷³ Chorzów (Merits) (n 44) 47.\n⁷⁴ Primacy of restitution over the other forms of reparation was confirmed in ibid, 47; quoted in Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31), 232, para 460; see also: The M/V ‘SAIGA’ (No 2) (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines v.

It consists of re-establishing the status quo ante; that is to say, recreating the situation as it existed prior to the occurrence of the wrongful act. What may be required as restitution depends on the primary obligation that has been breached.⁸⁶ Restitution may not be awarded, however, when it is materially impossible or if the burden is disproportionate to the benefit deriving from it.⁸⁷\n\nThe two main forms of restitution are: material and legal. Material restitution is the most common in State practice.⁸⁸ It can take various forms, including ‘the release of detained individuals, the handing over to a State of an individual arrested in its territory, the restitution of ships or other types of property, including documents, works of art, share certificates, etc.’⁸⁹ Legal restitution, sometimes also referred to as ‘juridical restitution’, implies the modification of a legal situation that violates international law. It might require the amendment or revocation of judicial decisions, administrative measures, acts of legislation or constitutional provisions.⁹⁰\n\nIn practice, restitution appears to be rarely awarded as a form of reparation.⁹¹ Despite the primacy of the restitutio in integrum as a form of reparation, the ICJ has only awarded it in a few cases.

    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nPreah Vihear case, the ICJ ordered Thailand to 'restore to Cambodia any objects of the kind specified in Cambodia's fifth Submission which may, since the date of the occupation of the Temple by Thailand in 1954, have been removed from the Temple or the Temple area by the Thai authorities'.[92] In the Tehran Hostages case, the ICJ ordered Iran to end the captivity of the US consular and diplomatic staff as a form of restitution.[93] In the Arrest Warrant case, the ICJ ordered Belgium to 'cancel the arrest warrant',[94] which constituted the full reparation of the damage. In the Land and Maritime Boundary case, the ICJ ruled that the States were under an obligation to expeditiously and unconditionally withdraw their administration, military and police force present on the territory, which fell under the sovereignty of the other State.[95] Finally, in the Avena case, the USA was under an obligation to 'provide, by means of its own choosing, review and reconsideration of the convictions and sentences of the Mexican nationals', which was also viewed as full restitution.[96]\n\nThe possibility of distinguishing cessation from restitutio in integrum is a vexing question under international law, as already mentioned. I previously contended that two conditions must be cumulatively met for the intrusion of a malware to cease: firstly, the end of any use, communication and control of the malware by its perpetrator; secondly, the perpetrator must communicate all the necessary information for the complete and definite removal of the malware from the infected system, and thus end the intrusion. Compliance with these two requirements would allow the injured State to be restored to the status quo ante, and thus would satisfy both the obligation of cessation and the obligation of restitution. In such cases, the obligation of restitution would, therefore, be satisfied. That does not necessarily mean that full reparation has been made in actual fact, especially when the cyber operation caused damage.\n\nThe damage caused by cyber operations may be either virtual or physical. A cyber operation may corrupt or delete data, as well as affect the operations of the infected system. The resulting malfunction may cause physical damage, as with Stuxnet, which physically damaged\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIranian centrifuges. In such scenario, the cessation of the intrusion and of the use of the intruded malware would not by itself constitute full reparation of the injury. In addition to the cessation of the intrusion, it is necessary to repair the resulting damage. The same conclusion can be drawn with regard to DDoS attacks; the cessation of the attack may simultaneously satisfy the obligations of cessation and reparation, unless damage was caused and needs to be repaired.\n\nIn cases of physical destruction or loss of data, the injury cannot be repaired by restitution. Indeed, the responsible State cannot restitute the damaged or lost items, and thus the injury should be repaired through other forms of reparation, most likely compensation. Thus, in such a case the reparation of the damage would include both restitution and compensation.\n\nIn some circumstances, the malware may have a spying function and may at the same time have copied data from the targeted system, which it altered or deleted from the infected system. In this specific case, the reparation of the damage could be partially achieved through restitution, namely by providing a copy of the copied or deleted data to the original owner. This situation is, however, unlikely to happen in reality for three reasons: firstly, it might be useless given that today's most important computer systems are backed up so the owner will be able to restore the deleted or altered data; secondly, the perpetrator might easily deny the veracity of the copy and could also manipulate the data before returning it; thirdly, there is a risk that the returned data might be corrupted. Only State and judicial practice will decide if these assertions are correct.\n\nMoreover, in the case of a malware having copied and downloaded the data, it can be argued that the restitution could also give rise to the destruction of the copied data in the possession of the responsible State. Such destruction would be symbolic, as it would be almost impossible for the injured State to know with any certainty if the responsible State had actually deleted all the stolen data in its possession. After the Snowden leak, the British GCHQ ordered the journalists at The Guardian to destroy the computers used to store the leaked documents. This example shows the uselessness of such requirement, since the journalists had already made several copies of the data and stored them elsewhere.⁹⁷\n\n⁹⁷ Luke Harding, ‘Footage Released of Guardian Editors Destroying Snowden Hard Drives’, The Guardian (31 January 2014) www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/31/footage-released-guardian-editors-snowden-hard-drives-gchq.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n\nIn sum, in most cases, the cessation of the cyber operation would satisfy both the obligations of cessation and restitution. However, if damage occurred, it seems that restitution offers little solution. In this instance, compensation is generally available.\n\n## 9.3.4.2 Compensation\n\nCompensation constitutes the second form of reparation, and involves payment of a sum in lieu of restitution when the latter is unavailable or inadequate.⁹⁸ The customary international law principle of compensation⁹⁹ as a form of reparation was confirmed and relied on by the PCIJ and the ICJ,¹⁰⁰ and codified by the ILC in Article 36 of the Articles on State Responsibility.¹⁰¹\n\nTo be eligible for compensation, the damage should be ‘financially assessable’.¹⁰² In the Lusitania case, the arbitrator made clear that even when the damage is difficult to evaluate in monetary terms this does not prevent compensation.¹⁰³ The ILC, in the ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’, provided the following non-exhaustive list of cases involving damage for which compensation may be sought:\n\n⁹⁸ Wittich (n 66), paras 10–11.\n\n⁹⁹ John Barker, ‘The Different Forms of Reparation: Compensation’ in James Crawford et al (eds), *The Law of International Responsibility* (OUP 2010) 599.\n\n¹⁰⁰ *Chorzów* (Merits) (n 44) 27–28 (‘It is a principle of international law that the reparation of a wrong may consist in an indemnity corresponding to the damage which the nationals of the injured State have suffered as a result of the act which is contrary to international law.’); *Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros* (Judgment) (n 29) 81, para 152 (‘It is a well-established rule of international law that an injured State is entitled to obtain compensation from the State which has committed an internationally wrongful act for the damage caused by it.’); *Bosnian genocide* (Judgment) (n 31) 232–233, para 460.\n\n¹⁰¹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 36.\n\n¹⁰² ‘Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility’ (n 11) 99; *The M/V ‘SAIGA’* (No 2) (Judgment) (n 74) para 171 (‘Reparation may take the form of monetary compensation for economically quantifiable damage as well as for non-material damage, depending on the circumstances of the case.’).\n\n¹⁰³ *The Lusitania* (n 84) 40 (‘That one injured is under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefor as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty. The tendency of the decisions and statutes of the several American States seems to be to broaden the scope of the elements to be considered in assessing actual and compensatory damages, with the corresponding result of narrowing the application of the exemplary damages rule.’).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n407\n\nA Material Damage Material damage is defined by the Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility as referring 'to damage to property or other interests of the State and its nationals which is assessable in financial terms'.[111] The damage results in the harm to legitimate interests of the State. Generally, the legitimate interests of the State that require protection may be grouped into three categories: its sovereignty, its properties and its nationals.[112] The question relevant to this book is: are cyber operations able to cause such damage? In other words, can cyber operations cause damage which then invokes the responsibility of the perpetrating State? This subsection provides a positive answer to this question, which the following paragraphs will demonstrate.\n\nThe structure of this subsection is based on the different forms of damage that cyber operations may cause. In some specific circumstances, cyber operations can produce physical damage, which makes the qualification of material damage easier (i). Generally, however, cyber operations produce mainly non-physical damage, which can also be referred to as intangible or immaterial damage. Then, it must be determined if such damage can amount to material damage (ii). Finally, I will reflect on the question of the compensation of the cost resulting from the removal of a malware (iii).\n\n(i) Physical Damage Caused by Cyber Operations Cyber operations can produce physical damage in some specific circumstances. Light was shed on this issue after the 2007 Aurora Generator Test conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory.[113] This test successfully demonstrated how a cyber operation could physically damage the component of a diesel generator. More generally, the test aimed to show how cyber operations could physically destroy parts of an electricity grid and lead to its malfunction. A few years later, the virus Stuxnet demonstrated this possibility in a concrete case. Stuxnet infected the computer system of the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran and damaged several centrifuges by causing the fast-spinning machines to tear themselves apart.

    "STATE RESPONSIBILITY\n\nfür Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik) published a report on the situation of cybersecurity in Germany, which described a cyber operation that caused massive damage to a steel facility. It did not disclose its name, however.¹¹⁴ According to the report, the cyber operation caused an accumulation of breakdowns of individual components of the control system affecting entire facilities, rendering a blast furnace impossible to shut down and causing massive damage to the machinery of an unspecified nature. Inevitably, the massive damage caused to the machinery is physical, and thus this cyber operation is the second one in history that reportedly caused physical damage.¹¹⁵ However, it is worth reiterating that the vast majority of cyber operations do not produce any physical damage. Cyber damage is primarily virtual.\n\nThe nature of the infrastructure physically damaged by a cyber operation can also be taken into account when assessing reparation. Damage caused to a critical infrastructure¹¹⁶ may be considered more serious, and thus necessitating a larger amount of reparation. Given this situation, I would argue that the victim State of a cyber operation which damages a critical infrastructure could request reparation in two forms: firstly, reparation of the actual physical damage caused to the infrastructure, more likely to be made by compensation; secondly, this reparation may be completed by satisfaction. The potential grave consequences of disruption or damage to critical infrastructure could, indeed, lead the victim State to call on the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct.¹¹⁷\n\nThe physical damage resulting from cyber operations would be assessed in the same way that other physical damage is assessed. Generally, as the damaged properties cannot be returned, the responsible State will have to offer compensation.

Might such damage constitute a material damage that is assessable in financial terms?\n\nIt is clear nowadays that data and software should be treated like property under international law, which reflects the situation in other areas of law. In domestic law, most national legislators recognise the property status of data and software, which mainly falls under the framework of intellectual property law and copyright law. Likewise, computer data seems to be protected at the international level. In WTO law, for instance, computer programs enjoy protection but this does not extend to data.¹¹⁹ The 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime criminalises, inter alia, offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems.¹²⁰ No international law treaty or international judicial or tribunal decision recognises the property rights of States over their data. Nevertheless, we can reasonably infer that computer data constitute ‘property or other interests’. This assertion can only be confirmed by State practice, which ought to provide a definitive answer on this question.\n\nThe second question that arises is whether data alteration, inaccessibility and destruction are assessable in financial terms. Data and software are properties regularly exchanged and sold, and thus their value can be easily calculated. The financial assessment of virtual damage resulting from a cyber operation is therefore possible.\n\nThe Tallinn Manual 2.0 adopts a similar approach. It notably states that ‘[i]n the context of cyber operations, the International Group of Experts agreed that interference with cyber operations or the loss of data that results in financial loss qualifies as material damage’, while ‘the mere\n\n¹¹⁸ Crawford, State Responsibility (n 14) 519.\n\n¹¹⁹ Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 1994 (Annex 1C of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization, signed in Marrakesh, Morocco on 15 April 1994, 1869 UNTS 299, 33 ILM 1197 (1994)), Article 10.\n\n¹²⁰ Convention on Cybercrime 2001 (signed at Budapest 23 November 2001, entered in force 7 January 2004, ETS 185) Article 2 ‘Illegal access’, Article 3 ‘Illegal interception’, Article 4 ‘Data interference’, Article 5 ‘System interference’ and Article 6 ‘Misuse of devices’.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

In addition to the damage as a result of the cyber operation, the injured State would bear the costs for the removal of the malware from its system and, in some cases, for the restoration of the system, including its security. Does the responsible State have to cover these costs as part of its obligation to make full reparation?\n\nAn analogy can be drawn with the costs resulting from the cleaning up of pollution. For instance, in January 1978 a Soviet satellite – Cosmos 954 – crashed on Canadian territory. Canada sought compensation for the Soviet satellite’s intrusion into its airspace and the deposit of hazardous radioactive debris from the satellite on Canadian territory.¹²² The second claim included the expenses incurred for locating, removing, testing and cleaning up the radioactive debris from the affected area.¹²³ Canada obtained compensation for both claims when the parties agreed to settle the case in 1981.¹²⁴\n\nSimilar awards of compensation could be made for the costs of cleaning up a computer system and completely removing the effects arising as a result of a state-sponsored cyber operation.\n\nB Moral Damage Moral damage may transpire separately or together with material damage. Moral damage is injury not associated with the actual damage to property or persons. Hence, it is generally not financially assessable.¹²⁵ Moral damage might be repaired through satisfaction given that it is generally not financially assessable, but reparation may also be made through compensation in certain circumstances.¹²⁶ In\n\n¹²¹ Schmitt and Vihul (n 1) 144–145, commentary to Rule 28, para 2.\n¹²² ‘Claim against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for Damage Caused by Soviet Cosmos 954’ (n 121) 899–930.\n¹²³ ibid 903–904, para 8.\n¹²⁴ ‘Protocol in Respect of the Claim for Damages Caused by the Satellite “Cosmos 954”.

For instance, website defacement – that is to say changing the visual appearance and content of a website – may qualify as an offence to the honour, dignity and prestige of the website's owner.¹²⁹ During the wave of cyber operations in the Russo-Georgian war of 2008, several official and commercial websites were defaced and taken down. For instance, the website of the Presidency of Georgia (www.president.gov.ge) was the target of DDoS attacks which caused the website to be taken down for twenty-four hours. A few days after this incident, the website of the Georgian president was defaced and images were posted in which the president was compared to Adolf Hitler.¹³⁰ This could amount to moral damage as it constitutes an offence to the dignity and prestige of both the Georgian State and its president. It seems unlikely that any court or tribunal would award compensation for the non-material damage suffered in relation to the president's website, however. In this case, satisfaction would be a more appropriate form of reparation.\n\nBy contrast, it seems more likely that a court or tribunal would award compensation for non-material damage resulting in loss of reputation caused by the defacement and taking down of private or commercial websites due to a state-sponsored cyber operation.

The violation of sovereignty by cyber operations, as developed earlier in the book, is the ideal situation for awarding satisfaction as a form of reparation. A violation of territorial sovereignty amounts to non-material damage, which is not assessable financially. Because of the absence of material damage, restitution and compensation are inapplicable. Satisfaction as a form of reparation for the violation of territorial sovereignty has already been awarded, most notably in the Corfu Channel case and the Rainbow Warrior case.¹³⁸\n\nGiven that the international legal regime of cyber operations is not yet fully settled, satisfaction could serve as a useful tool by requesting the responsible State to recognise the unlawfulness of its cyber conduct. Such recognition could be requested together with guarantees and assurances of non-repetition of unlawful cyber operations of the same nature.\n\nIn the section dedicated to restitutio in integrum, I argued that requiring the destruction of the hard drive containing the data stolen by the cyber operation would be useless because the perpetrators can easily have made copies of the data. Such measures may, however, fulfil satisfaction. In such cases, the destruction of the hard drive could serve a political purpose.

Secondly, it could also have an impact on public opinion in both States, by showing the restoration of normal relations and the end of the conflict related to the stolen data. In sum, the destruction of the hard drive could serve as a form of satisfaction.\n\nThe nature of the target of a cyber operation could also urge the victim State to ask for satisfaction. Cyber operations targeting critical infrastructures may have particularly serious consequences.^[139]^ In such cases, the form of satisfaction could amount to a request to the perpetrating State to acknowledge its misbehaviour, apologise for it and offer guarantees of non-repetition of such conduct. This assertion is only hypothetical and does not reflect current State practice; however, in my judgement, it offers a way to address the specific character and risks of cyber operations which cause damage to critical infrastructures.\n\nThe appropriate form of satisfaction cannot be prescribed in advance and will depend on the circumstances of each case. Consequently, this research cannot settle which form of satisfaction should be awarded in every scenario. It must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## 9.3.4.4 Concluding Remarks on the Forms of Reparation\n\nThis section on the forms of reparation showed that the damage caused by cyber operations may be difficult to repair through restitution. In most cases, compensation constitutes the most appropriate form of reparation.\n\n## 9.3.5 The Difficult Reparation of the Consequences of NotPetya\n\n'NotPetya' refers to a series of cyber operations using a modified version of the Petya malware directed mainly against Ukrainian systems and networks but also those in other countries, starting on 27 June 2017.^[140]^ NotPetya mimicked a ransomware but its objective was to wipe off the data from the infected computers. NotPetya is to date the malware having caused the biggest economic losses, being held responsible for having inflicted more than US$1 billion in damage worldwide.^[141]^\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
    "OBLIGATION OF MAKING REPARATION\n415\n\nSome States hold the Russian Federation responsible for NotPetya, leading to the question of reparation for the consequences of the cyber operations if those States were actually invoking the responsibility of Russia. The three available forms of reparation under the law of State responsibility are: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. Since NotPetya wiped off the infected systems, it would be impossible to repair its consequences through restitution. Conversely, compensation appears to be an appropriate option for the reparation of the consequences of NotPetya since it resulted in important economic losses. Finally, the victim States might also decide to request that, in addition to compensation, the reparation also take the form of satisfaction, such as the acknowledgement by the responsible State of its wrongful behaviour.\n\nConsequently, if the victim States were invoking the responsibility of the perpetrating State, international law would offer appropriate solutions to repair the consequences of NotPetya. To date, the victim States have only attributed the case without addressing the question of the lawfulness of NotPetya under international law, nor the question of State responsibility.\n\nThe reparation of the consequences of NotPetya is more controversial when it comes to repairing the actual losses of the private actors concerned.\n\nOn 10 October 2018, Mondelēz International filed a contract complaint before the Circuit Court of Cook County in Illinois in the USA against Zurich American Insurance, its insurance company, regarding the refusal of the latter to cover the loss of Mondelēz International due to NotPetya, which is estimated at US$188 million.¹⁴² According to Mondelēz International, its policy insurance with Zurich American Insurance covered:\n\n‘all risks of physical loss or damage’ to MDLZ’s property, specifically including ‘physical loss or damage to electronic data, programs, or software, including loss or damage caused by the malicious introduction of a machine code or instruction’.\n\nIn addition, it stated that the policy also provided coverage for loss or expenses ‘incurred by the Insured during the period of business interruption directly resulting from the failure of the Insured’s electronic data processing equipment or media to operate’.\n\n¹⁴² Mondelēz International, Inc (Plaintiff) v.

Thus, the injury suffered by the national of State C has been caused by two distinct wrongful acts: the abduction by State A and the mistreatment by State B. On the other hand, the States responsible may have jointly perpetrated an internationally wrongful act which harms the victim State.¹⁴⁷ Such a scenario generally happens in the case of jointly conducted wrongful act.\n\n## 9.4.1 An Injury Caused by a Plurality of Internationally Wrongful Acts of Several States\n\nIn the case of a plurality of States perpetrating different wrongful acts, each State is responsible for its own acts. Thus, each State owes an obligation to cease and provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, if circumstances require so. However, these obligations pertain to its own acts only and not to the acts of other States. Regarding the obligation to make full reparation, it is necessary to assess the causal link between each internationally wrongful act and the injury.¹⁴⁸ A State would have to repair the damage where it has a sufficient direct and certain causal link with its internationally wrongful act. Pierre d'Argent builds an illuminating hypothetical case based on the ICJ’s Genocide case. If State A breached its obligation to prevent genocide but genocide was committed by State B, it might be difficult to establish a ‘sufficient direct and certain causal link’¹⁴⁹ between the wrongful act of State A and the genocide committed by State B.¹⁵⁰ Thus, State A would owe reparation for the breach of the obligation to prevent genocide while State B would owe reparation for the crime of genocide itself.\n\nTwo situations may be distinguished: on the one hand, wrongful acts that give rise to damages which are ‘complementary’ in causing the injury; on the other, only the accumulation of the wrongful acts creating the injury, which are said to be ‘cumulative’. In the case of complementary wrongful acts, each State will owe reparation for the\n\n¹⁴⁶ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 213 et seq.\n¹⁴⁷ ibid 232 et seq.\n¹⁴⁸ ibid 222.\n¹⁴⁹ Bosnian genocide (Judgment) (n 31) 234, para 462.\n¹⁵⁰ d’Argent, ‘Reparation, Cessation, Assurances and Guarantees of Non-repetition’ (n 62) 222.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",

Two approaches are available: either to identify one act as the main source of the injury and thus request reparation from its author, or to consider any of the wrongdoing States fully responsible for the injury.¹⁵²\n\nSuch a situation could easily arise in cyberspace. Take, for example, the situation where State A infects the computer system of State V with a malware which serves as a back door for further access to the infected system. State A gives access to this back door to State B, which decides to exploit it in order to infect the system of State V with damaging malware. In such a scenario, both State A and State B are responsible, but State A owes reparation for the first infection only, while State B owes reparation for the damage caused by the second malware. Thus, the reparation could be as follows: State A owes reparation for its breach of State V's sovereignty, and in all likelihood would repair it through satisfaction. Conversely, State B owes reparation for the damage, which can generally be repaired through compensation.\n\n## 9.4.2 An Injury Caused by a Joint Internationally Wrongful Act of Several States\n\nIn the case of multiple States that jointly perpetrate a wrongful act, each State is held responsible¹⁵³ and their responsibility may be invoked jointly or separately.¹⁵⁴ The injured State can receive compensation, but only within the limit of the amount of the damage, from one or more responsible States. Thus the damage cannot be fully compensated twice, by two different responsible States.¹⁵⁵\n\nStuxnet is generally considered to be a joint cyber operation by two States, the United States and Israel. In such a case, both States would be held responsible for one joint internationally wrongful act, and both would owe full reparation for the damage caused.\n\n¹⁵¹ ibid 224–227.\n¹⁵² ibid 227–232.\n¹⁵³ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 47.\n¹⁵⁴ Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v.

    "SHARED RESPONSIBILITY\n\nThe joint commission of an internationally wrongful act may take various forms and the participation of each State may not have the same impact. In some circumstances, participation may be limited to the mere provision of aid or assistance to the actual perpetrating State. A State which aids or assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful cyber operation is responsible if two cumulative criteria are met: firstly, it does so knowingly; secondly, the cyber operation would also be unlawful if the act is actually perpetrated by the helping State itself.¹⁵⁶ The aiding State is responsible only for aid or assistance that it provided for the commission of the unlawful cyber operation, but not for the cyber operation itself.\n\nSuch provision of aid or assistance could take numerous forms in the cyber context. For instance, State A may place at the disposal of State B some computer experts to assist it in launching a cyber operation against State C.¹⁵⁷ In such case, State B would be responsible for the cyber operations and their consequences, while State A would be responsible for only having assisted State B. The selling of access to a back door in the computer systems of a third State or information of vulnerability may also amount to a form of assistance. For instance, in the case of State A selling State B access to a back door, which it planted in the system of State C, State A would be responsible only for planting the back door and the assistance it provided to State B. It would not be responsible for the cyber operation conducted by State B, which used the purchased back door. It is necessary to clarify, however, that in this situation we are not dealing with a joint cyber operation (and a fortiori a joint wrongful act) but with two different cyber operations. Therefore, each State is responsible for its own cyber conduct only. This last example also shows that it is sometimes difficult to demarcate the line between joint commission of an internationally wrongful act and an injury resulting from multiple internationally wrongful acts.\n\nEach form of aid or assistance that may be provided by a State for the perpetration of a wrongful cyber operation by another State may not be treated in the same manner. Only future State practice will settle the legal\n\n¹⁵⁶ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 16.

In other cases, however, the aid or assistance provided may be seen as a form of co-authorship and thus the State would be responsible not only for the provision of assistance but also for the wrongful cyber operation and its consequences.\n\nIt is important to note that the provision of aid or assistance must be distinguished from the duty of diligence. The State has a duty to prevent the use of its territory for the commission of a wrongful act against another State. This is an obligation of action; it is not an obligation of result. The transit of a cyber operation through the computer network of a State is not tantamount to the provision of aid or assistance by the State. Conversely, the fact that a State allows another State to use its cyber infrastructure to launch a cyber operation clearly amounts to a form of provision of aid or assistance in the commission of a wrongful cyber operation.\n\n### Concluding Remarks on Shared Responsibility\n\nStates may have an interest in cooperating in the perpetration of large-scale or highly complex cyber operations, such as Stuxnet, and the rules of shared responsibility would be particularly relevant to these kinds of operations.\n\nI discussed previously whether the United States may be held responsible for not having informed Microsoft of the existence of a vulnerability in their product and for creating the exploit later used by WannaCry. WannaCry has been attributed to North Korea by some States, including the United States. Yet, we may wonder whether the paternity of the United States over the exploit used for WannaCry may lead that State to share the responsibility for this ransomware with the perpetrating State. In the eventuality of a potential US responsibility for WannaCry, it is not a question of joint perpetration of the act but one of whether the United States has perpetrated a distinct internationally wrongful act that has contributed to the situation and the injury. As already developed in this book, there is nothing under international law prohibiting a State from developing and using malicious cyber tools, thus the United States has not perpetrated any wrongful act in this case.",
    "CONCLUDING REMARKS\n421\n\n# 9.5 Concluding Remarks on State Responsibility and the Consequences of an Internationally Wrongful Cyber Operation\n\nThis chapter analysed the responsibility of States perpetrating internationally unlawful cyber operations. For a State to be responsible for the perpetration of a cyber operation, two conditions must be met: the cyber operation must constitute an internationally wrongful act and it must be attributable to the State. The question of the lawfulness of cyber operations under international law has been dealt with in Part II of this book, while the question of attribution was dealt with in Part I.\n\nThe State responsible has several obligations under the law of State responsibility. Firstly, it has to cease its wrongful conduct if this has a continuing character. Secondly, it has to provide assurances and guarantees of non-repetition in certain circumstances. In addition to these two criteria, the third criterion stipulates that when the wrongful cyber operation causes damage, then the responsible State owes an obligation to make full reparation. This reparation can take three different forms: restitution, compensation and satisfaction. In some circumstances, the wrongdoing State may also have to satisfy reparation by paying interest to the injured State.¹⁵⁹ This chapter demonstrated that, in most cases, compensation is the most appropriate form of reparation, which is followed by satisfaction.\n\nThe injured State may have recourse to judicial or extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to fulfil its obligations, that is to say to terminate its cyber operation and make full reparation if it caused damage. Chapter 10 focuses on measures of self-help that can be taken by the injured State, as extrajudicial measures to compel the wrongdoing State to comply with its obligations under the law of State responsibility.\n\n¹⁵⁹ Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108780605.014 Published online by Cambridge University Press",
