There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013,¹ and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015² and 2021,³ and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021.⁴ The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace. What is needed is an\n¹ 2013 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (UN Doc.

And that is the issue on the international agenda today, in line with the mandate of the current OEWG (2021-2025).⁵\nStates should therefore develop and publish national positions on how they interpret the rules of international law as applied to state conduct in cyberspace. Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE.⁶ And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States.⁷ The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to\n⁵ See UN Doc.

A/76/136).\n⁷ Also available at https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/a8911fc020c94eb386a1ec7917bf0d03/norwegian_positions.pdf\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nmake the paper easier to read and understand, it highlights key messages and includes practical examples.\nCertain issues need particular emphasis, and State sovereignty is one of them. The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n473\nthe GGE failed to adopt a consensus report in 2017. However, agreement on an explicit reference to the applicability of IHL as such, and not only to the fundamental principles of IHL, was reached in the 2021 GGE report⁸ and reiterated in the first annual progress report of the current OEWG in 2022.⁹ Now that consensus has been reached on the basics, there is an urgent need to discuss further how IHL applies to cyber operations. For instance, a common understanding should be sought as to whether digital data enjoys legal protection against damage and destruction similar to that afforded to physical objects. Strengthening a common understanding of the law would also weaken certain States' narrative that there is a need for a new cyber-specific convention.\nFinally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\nMay, 2023\n8 UN Doc.

This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE)¹ concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows:\nInternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.²\nThis was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety.³ The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace.⁴ Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’\nCompliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n1.

However, numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties are also binding on States, and cyber activity perpetrated by or attributable to a State also has the potential to violate such obligations.\n## 2 The Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\n*International law applies in cyberspace.*\nExisting international law, that is customary international law and international treaties, has not been developed with cyberspace in mind. However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State.¹⁴ The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations.¹⁵ The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace.¹⁶ It refers to the supreme authority of\n¹⁴ This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n¹⁵ This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n¹⁶ *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n477\nevery State within its territory to the exclusion of other States, and also in its relations with other States.\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated.¹⁷ Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n¹⁷ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.*\nglobe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nSimilarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.¹⁸\nThis is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'.¹⁹ Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention\n**Key message:**\nCyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n¹⁸ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n¹⁹ *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n479\nThe prohibition of intervention applies to a State's cyber operations as it does to other State activities.²⁰ Accordingly, a State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law.²¹\nA cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy.²² The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force\n**Key message:**\nA cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n²⁰ Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n²¹ Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n²² Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law.²³ It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.²⁴\nThere are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise.²⁵ Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law.²⁶,²⁷ In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.²⁸\nA cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force.²⁹ This list is not exhaustive.\n²³ Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n²⁴ See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁵ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n²⁷ A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n²⁸ Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n481\nCyber operations that cause death or injury to persons or physical damage to or the destruction of objects could clearly amount to the use of force. Likewise, a cyber operation causing severe disruption to the functioning of the State such as the use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against governmental or private power grid- or telecommunications infrastructure, or cyber operations leading to the destruction of stockpiles of Covid-19 vaccines, could amount to the use of force in violation of Article 2(4). Similarly, the use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilisation, may amount to the use of force in violation of Article 2(4).\nA cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n## 4 State Responsibility\n**Key message:**\nIn order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law.³⁰ Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting\n³⁰ The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR. The other condition, that the act or omission must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State, is dealt with in Section 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\ndirectly or indirectly on behalf of a State, the State may nevertheless be held responsible under international law if it fails to take adequate measures against cyber operations that target third States from or via its territory.\n## 4.1 Attribution under International Law\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by an organ of the State or by actors exercising governmental authority on behalf of the State.³¹\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by non-State actors if these are conducted on the direct instructions of the State or under its direction or effective control.³² It may be technically challenging to establish that a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence\nFurthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.³³\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment,³⁴ and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n³¹ Cf. ILC ASR, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 7.\n³² See Article 8 ILC ASR. See also Nicaragua judgment, para 115, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ICJ, judgment 27 February 2007, para. 400.\n³³ See Article 2 ILC ASR, which explicitly states that a State’s conduct may consist of ‘an action or omission’. See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁴ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n483\nrespect to a right of the target State under international law, it is required to take adequate measures to address the situation.\nThe due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation.³⁵ Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations.³⁶ This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.³⁷\nNorway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n³⁵ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁶ See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n³⁷ A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n## 5 Response Measures\nThe response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n## 5.1 Retorsion\nA State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n## 5.2 Countermeasures\nIf a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act³⁸ as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.³⁹ If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n³⁸ In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n³⁹ See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n485\nand countermeasures in response to cyber operations may therefore be carried out within or outside cyberspace. Countermeasures must not violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force or international humanitarian law.\nThe State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures.⁴⁰ Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity\nIn a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n⁴⁰ ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\nIt should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.⁴¹\n## 5.4 Self-defence\nA State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality⁴², and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law\n**Key message:**\n*International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.*\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*. Of particular relevance is the prohibition\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\n⁴¹ See Article 25 ILC ASR.\n⁴² See e.g. *Nicaragua* judgment paras. 176, 194, and *Oil Platforms*, ICJ, judgement 6 November 2003, paras. 43, 73-74, 76.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n487\nagainst the use of force. International disputes must be settled by peaceful means, in cyberspace as in all other domains.\nThe general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44\nUnder IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\nStates must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n43 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflict (AP I), Article 49(1).\n44 AP I, Article 51(2) and 52(1).\n45 See, for instance, Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (GCI), Article 19; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (GCII), Article 12; Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (GCIV), Article 18; AP I, Article 12; AP II, Article 11; ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 25, 28, 29.\n46 AP I, Article 54; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (AP II), Article 14; ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 54.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nInternational human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n## Note from the publisher\nThe author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.

There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013, and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015 and 2021, and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021. The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace. What is needed is an\n\nPublished with license by Koninklijke Brill NV | DOI: 10.1163/15718107-20230003\n© VIBEKE MUSÆUS, 2023 | ISSN: 0902-7351 (print) 1571-8107 (online)\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nStates should therefore develop and publish national positions on how they interpret the rules of international law as applied to state conduct in cyberspace. Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE. And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States. The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to\n See UN Doc.

The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nFinally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\nMay, 2023\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n# Norwegian Positions on Selected Questions of International Law relating to Cyberspace May 2021\n## 1 Introduction\nInternational law applies in cyberspace. This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows:\nInternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.\nThis was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety. The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace. Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’\nCompliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n1.

However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State. The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations. The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace. It refers to the supreme authority of\n This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated. Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.*\nglobe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nSimilarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nThis is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'. Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention\n**Key message:**\nCyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nA cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy. The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force\n**Key message:**\nA cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law. It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.\nThere are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise. Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law., In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nA cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force. This list is not exhaustive.\n Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nA cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n## 4 State Responsibility\n**Key message:**\nIn order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law. Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting\n The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR. The other condition, that the act or omission must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State, is dealt with in Section 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\ndirectly or indirectly on behalf of a State, the State may nevertheless be held responsible under international law if it fails to take adequate measures against cyber operations that target third States from or via its territory.\n## 4.1 Attribution under International Law\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by an organ of the State or by actors exercising governmental authority on behalf of the State.\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by non-State actors if these are conducted on the direct instructions of the State or under its direction or effective control. It may be technically challenging to establish that a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence\nFurthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment, and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n Cf. ILC ASR, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 7.\n See Article 8 ILC ASR. See also Nicaragua judgment, para 115, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ICJ, judgment 27 February 2007, para. 400.\n See Article 2 ILC ASR, which explicitly states that a State’s conduct may consist of ‘an action or omission’. See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation. Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations. This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.\nNorway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n## 5 Response Measures\nThe response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n## 5.1 Retorsion\nA State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n## 5.2 Countermeasures\nIf a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act as a ground for precluding wrongfulness. If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures. Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity\nIn a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\nIt should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.\n## 5.4 Self-defence\nA State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality, and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law\n**Key message:**\n*International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.*\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*. Of particular relevance is the prohibition\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\n See Article 25 ILC ASR.\n See e.g. *Nicaragua* judgment paras. 176, 194, and *Oil Platforms*, ICJ, judgement 6 November 2003, paras. 43, 73-74, 76.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44\nUnder IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\nStates must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nInternational human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n## Note from the publisher\nThe author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.

    "## 2 The Application of International Law in Cyberspace": "**Key message:**\n*International law applies in cyberspace.*\nExisting international law, that is customary international law and international treaties, has not been developed with cyberspace in mind. However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.",
    "## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law": "**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State.¹⁴ The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations.¹⁵ The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace.¹⁶ It refers to the supreme authority of\n¹⁴ This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n¹⁵ This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n¹⁶ *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated.¹⁷ Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n¹⁷ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.* globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY Similarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.¹⁸ This is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'.¹⁹ Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention **Key message:** Cyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 ¹⁸ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n¹⁹ *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy.²² The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force **Key message:** A cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 --- ²⁰ Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n²¹ Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n²² Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law.²³ It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.²⁴ There are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise.²⁵ Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law.²⁶,²⁷ In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.²⁸ A cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force.²⁹ This list is not exhaustive.\n²³ Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n²⁴ See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁵ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n²⁷ A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n²⁸ Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER A cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.",

However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence Furthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.³³ As a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment,³⁴ and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 ³¹ Cf.

See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁴ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22 NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER The due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation.³⁵ Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations.³⁶ This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.³⁷ Norway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n³⁵ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁶ See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n³⁷ A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY ## 5 Response Measures The response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.",
    "## 5.1 Retorsion A State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.": "## 5.2 Countermeasures If a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act³⁸ as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.³⁹ If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response, NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 --- ³⁸ In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n³⁹ See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER The State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures.⁴⁰ Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity In a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n⁴⁰ ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488 NORWAY It should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.⁴¹ ## 5.4 Self-defence A State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality⁴², and may involve both digital and conventional means.",

It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace.

'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44 Under IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.",

There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013, and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015 and 2021, and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021. The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace. What is needed is an\n\nPublished with license by Koninklijke Brill NV | DOI: 10.1163/15718107-20230003\n© VIBEKE MUSÆUS, 2023 | ISSN: 0902-7351 (print) 1571-8107 (online)\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nStates should therefore develop and publish national positions on how they interpret the rules of international law as applied to state conduct in cyberspace. Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE. And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States. The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to\n See UN Doc.

A/76/136).\n Also available at https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/a8911fc020c94eb386a1ec7917bf0d03/norwegian_positions.pdf\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nmake the paper easier to read and understand, it highlights key messages and includes practical examples.\nCertain issues need particular emphasis, and State sovereignty is one of them. The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nFinally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\nMay, 2023\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n# Norwegian Positions on Selected Questions of International Law relating to Cyberspace May 2021\n## 1 Introduction\nInternational law applies in cyberspace. This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows:\nInternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.\nThis was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety. The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace. Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’\nCompliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n1.

However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State. The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations. The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace. It refers to the supreme authority of\n This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated. Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.*\nglobe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nSimilarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nThis is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'. Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention\n**Key message:**\nCyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nA cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy. The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force\n**Key message:**\nA cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law. It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.\nThere are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise. Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law., In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nA cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force. This list is not exhaustive.\n Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nA cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n## 4 State Responsibility\n**Key message:**\nIn order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law. Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting\n The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR. The other condition, that the act or omission must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State, is dealt with in Section 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\ndirectly or indirectly on behalf of a State, the State may nevertheless be held responsible under international law if it fails to take adequate measures against cyber operations that target third States from or via its territory.\n## 4.1 Attribution under International Law\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by an organ of the State or by actors exercising governmental authority on behalf of the State.\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by non-State actors if these are conducted on the direct instructions of the State or under its direction or effective control. It may be technically challenging to establish that a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence\nFurthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment, and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n Cf. ILC ASR, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 7.\n See Article 8 ILC ASR. See also Nicaragua judgment, para 115, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ICJ, judgment 27 February 2007, para. 400.\n See Article 2 ILC ASR, which explicitly states that a State’s conduct may consist of ‘an action or omission’. See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation. Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations. This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.\nNorway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n## 5 Response Measures\nThe response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n## 5.1 Retorsion\nA State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n## 5.2 Countermeasures\nIf a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act as a ground for precluding wrongfulness. If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures. Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity\nIn a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\nIt should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.\n## 5.4 Self-defence\nA State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality, and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law\n**Key message:**\n*International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.*\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*. Of particular relevance is the prohibition\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\n See Article 25 ILC ASR.\n See e.g. *Nicaragua* judgment paras. 176, 194, and *Oil Platforms*, ICJ, judgement 6 November 2003, paras. 43, 73-74, 76.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44\nUnder IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\nStates must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nInternational human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n## Note from the publisher\nThe author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.

There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013, and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015 and 2021, and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021. The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace. What is needed is an\n\nPublished with license by Koninklijke Brill NV | DOI: 10.1163/15718107-20230003\n© VIBEKE MUSÆUS, 2023 | ISSN: 0902-7351 (print) 1571-8107 (online)\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nStates should therefore develop and publish national positions on how they interpret the rules of international law as applied to state conduct in cyberspace. Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE. And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States. The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to\n See UN Doc.

The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nFinally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\nMay, 2023\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n# Norwegian Positions on Selected Questions of International Law relating to Cyberspace May 2021\n## 1 Introduction\nInternational law applies in cyberspace. This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows:\nInternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.\nThis was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety. The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace. Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’\nCompliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n1.

However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State. The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations. The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace. It refers to the supreme authority of\n This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated. Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.*\nglobe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nSimilarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nThis is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'. Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention\n**Key message:**\nCyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nA cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy. The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force\n**Key message:**\nA cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law. It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.\nThere are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise. Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law., In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nA cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force. This list is not exhaustive.\n Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nA cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n## 4 State Responsibility\n**Key message:**\nIn order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law. Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting\n The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR. The other condition, that the act or omission must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State, is dealt with in Section 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\ndirectly or indirectly on behalf of a State, the State may nevertheless be held responsible under international law if it fails to take adequate measures against cyber operations that target third States from or via its territory.\n## 4.1 Attribution under International Law\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by an organ of the State or by actors exercising governmental authority on behalf of the State.\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by non-State actors if these are conducted on the direct instructions of the State or under its direction or effective control. It may be technically challenging to establish that a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence\nFurthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment, and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n Cf. ILC ASR, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 7.\n See Article 8 ILC ASR. See also Nicaragua judgment, para 115, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ICJ, judgment 27 February 2007, para. 400.\n See Article 2 ILC ASR, which explicitly states that a State’s conduct may consist of ‘an action or omission’. See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation. Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations. This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.\nNorway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n## 5 Response Measures\nThe response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n## 5.1 Retorsion\nA State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n## 5.2 Countermeasures\nIf a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act as a ground for precluding wrongfulness. If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures. Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity\nIn a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\nIt should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.\n## 5.4 Self-defence\nA State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality, and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law\n**Key message:**\n*International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.*\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*. Of particular relevance is the prohibition\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\n See Article 25 ILC ASR.\n See e.g. *Nicaragua* judgment paras. 176, 194, and *Oil Platforms*, ICJ, judgement 6 November 2003, paras. 43, 73-74, 76.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44\nUnder IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\nStates must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nInternational human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n## Note from the publisher\nThe author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.

There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013,¹ and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015² and 2021,³ and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021.⁴ The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace. What is needed is an\n¹ 2013 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (UN Doc.

And that is the issue on the international agenda today, in line with the mandate of the current OEWG (2021-2025).⁵\nStates should therefore develop and publish national positions on how they interpret the rules of international law as applied to state conduct in cyberspace. Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE.⁶ And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States.⁷ The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to\n⁵ See UN Doc.

A/76/136).\n⁷ Also available at https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/a8911fc020c94eb386a1ec7917bf0d03/norwegian_positions.pdf\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nmake the paper easier to read and understand, it highlights key messages and includes practical examples.\nCertain issues need particular emphasis, and State sovereignty is one of them. The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n473\nthe GGE failed to adopt a consensus report in 2017. However, agreement on an explicit reference to the applicability of IHL as such, and not only to the fundamental principles of IHL, was reached in the 2021 GGE report⁸ and reiterated in the first annual progress report of the current OEWG in 2022.⁹ Now that consensus has been reached on the basics, there is an urgent need to discuss further how IHL applies to cyber operations. For instance, a common understanding should be sought as to whether digital data enjoys legal protection against damage and destruction similar to that afforded to physical objects. Strengthening a common understanding of the law would also weaken certain States' narrative that there is a need for a new cyber-specific convention.\nFinally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\nMay, 2023\n8 UN Doc.

This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE)¹ concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows:\nInternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.²\nThis was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety.³ The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace.⁴ Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’\nCompliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n1.

See UN Doc., 12 March 2021, A/AC.290/2021/CRP.2 para. 34.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n475\nThe focus of this paper is on cyber activity that threatens international peace and security, and on issues of State sovereignty. However, numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties are also binding on States, and cyber activity perpetrated by or attributable to a State also has the potential to violate such obligations.\n## 2 The Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\n*International law applies in cyberspace.*\nExisting international law, that is customary international law and international treaties, has not been developed with cyberspace in mind. However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State.¹⁴ The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations.¹⁵ The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace.¹⁶ It refers to the supreme authority of\n¹⁴ This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n¹⁵ This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n¹⁶ *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n477\nevery State within its territory to the exclusion of other States, and also in its relations with other States.\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated.¹⁷ Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n¹⁷ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.*\nglobe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nSimilarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.¹⁸\nThis is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'.¹⁹ Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention\n**Key message:**\nCyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n¹⁸ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n¹⁹ *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n479\nThe prohibition of intervention applies to a State's cyber operations as it does to other State activities.²⁰ Accordingly, a State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law.²¹\nA cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy.²² The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force\n**Key message:**\nA cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n²⁰ Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n²¹ Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n²² Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law.²³ It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.²⁴\nThere are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise.²⁵ Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law.²⁶,²⁷ In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.²⁸\nA cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force.²⁹ This list is not exhaustive.\n²³ Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n²⁴ See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁵ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n²⁷ A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n²⁸ Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n481\nCyber operations that cause death or injury to persons or physical damage to or the destruction of objects could clearly amount to the use of force. Likewise, a cyber operation causing severe disruption to the functioning of the State such as the use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against governmental or private power grid- or telecommunications infrastructure, or cyber operations leading to the destruction of stockpiles of Covid-19 vaccines, could amount to the use of force in violation of Article 2(4). Similarly, the use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilisation, may amount to the use of force in violation of Article 2(4).\nA cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n## 4 State Responsibility\n**Key message:**\nIn order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law.³⁰ Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting\n³⁰ The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR. The other condition, that the act or omission must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State, is dealt with in Section 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\ndirectly or indirectly on behalf of a State, the State may nevertheless be held responsible under international law if it fails to take adequate measures against cyber operations that target third States from or via its territory.\n## 4.1 Attribution under International Law\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by an organ of the State or by actors exercising governmental authority on behalf of the State.³¹\nA State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by non-State actors if these are conducted on the direct instructions of the State or under its direction or effective control.³² It may be technically challenging to establish that a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence\nFurthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.³³\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment,³⁴ and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n³¹ Cf. ILC ASR, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 7.\n³² See Article 8 ILC ASR. See also Nicaragua judgment, para 115, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ICJ, judgment 27 February 2007, para. 400.\n³³ See Article 2 ILC ASR, which explicitly states that a State’s conduct may consist of ‘an action or omission’. See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁴ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n483\nrespect to a right of the target State under international law, it is required to take adequate measures to address the situation.\nThe due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation.³⁵ Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations.³⁶ This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.³⁷\nNorway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n³⁵ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁶ See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n³⁷ A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\n## 5 Response Measures\nThe response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n## 5.1 Retorsion\nA State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n## 5.2 Countermeasures\nIf a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act³⁸ as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.³⁹ If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response,\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n---\n³⁸ In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n³⁹ See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n485\nand countermeasures in response to cyber operations may therefore be carried out within or outside cyberspace. Countermeasures must not violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force or international humanitarian law.\nThe State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures.⁴⁰ Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity\nIn a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n⁴⁰ ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY\nIt should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.⁴¹\n## 5.4 Self-defence\nA State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality⁴², and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law\n**Key message:**\n*International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.*\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*. Of particular relevance is the prohibition\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\n⁴¹ See Article 25 ILC ASR.\n⁴² See e.g. *Nicaragua* judgment paras. 176, 194, and *Oil Platforms*, ICJ, judgement 6 November 2003, paras. 43, 73-74, 76.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n487\nagainst the use of force. International disputes must be settled by peaceful means, in cyberspace as in all other domains.\nThe general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44\nUnder IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\nStates must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n43 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflict (AP I), Article 49(1).\n44 AP I, Article 51(2) and 52(1).\n45 See, for instance, Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (GCI), Article 19; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (GCII), Article 12; Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (GCIV), Article 18; AP I, Article 12; AP II, Article 11; ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 25, 28, 29.\n46 AP I, Article 54; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (AP II), Article 14; ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 54.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nInternational human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n## Note from the publisher\nThe author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.

There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013,¹ and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015² and 2021,³ and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021.⁴ The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace. What is needed is an ¹ 2013 Report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, (UN Doc.

Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE.⁶ And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States.⁷ The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to ⁵ See UN Doc. A/RES/75/240, para. 1.\n⁶ Official compendium of voluntary national contributions on the subject of how international law applies to the use of information and communications technologies by States submitted by participating governmental experts in the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 73/266, (UN Doc. A/76/136).\n⁷ Also available at https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/a8911fc020c94eb386a1ec7917bf0d03/norwegian_positions.pdf NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY make the paper easier to read and understand, it highlights key messages and includes practical examples.\nCertain issues need particular emphasis, and State sovereignty is one of them. The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER Finally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\nMay, 2023 NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY # Norwegian Positions on Selected Questions of International Law relating to Cyberspace May 2021 ## 1 Introduction International law applies in cyberspace. This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE)¹ concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows: International law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.² This was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety.³ The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace.⁴ Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’ Compliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\n## 2 The Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n**Key message:**\n*International law applies in cyberspace.*\nExisting international law, that is customary international law and international treaties, has not been developed with cyberspace in mind. However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\nNORWAY\nobligation of the State.¹⁴ The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations.¹⁵ The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace.¹⁶ It refers to the supreme authority of\n¹⁴ This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n¹⁵ This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n¹⁶ *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. Independence in regard to a portion of the*\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n\nThe internal dimension of a State's sovereignty includes the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction within its territory, including over the information systems located on its territory, and to exercise independent State powers. The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated.¹⁷ Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n¹⁷ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.* globe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY Similarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.¹⁸ This is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'.¹⁹ Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention **Key message:** Cyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 ¹⁸ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n¹⁹ *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER A cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy.²² The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force **Key message:** A cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 --- ²⁰ Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n²¹ Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n²² Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.\nNORWAY Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law.²³ It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.²⁴ There are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise.²⁵ Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law.²⁶,²⁷ In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.²⁸ A cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force.²⁹ This list is not exhaustive.\n²³ Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n²⁴ See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n²⁵ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n²⁶ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n²⁷ A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. See Section 5 Response measures in this paper.\n²⁸ Nicaragua judgment, para. 191: ‘[...] it will be necessary to distinguish the most grave forms of the use of force (those constituting an armed attack) from other less grave forms’.\n²⁹ Tallinn Manual 2.0., commentary to Rule 69, p. 333-337, paras. 9-10.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER A cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n## 4 State Responsibility **Key message:** In order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law.³⁰ Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting ³⁰ The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR. The other condition, that the act or omission must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State, is dealt with in Section 3.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488 NORWAY directly or indirectly on behalf of a State, the State may nevertheless be held responsible under international law if it fails to take adequate measures against cyber operations that target third States from or via its territory.\n## 4.1 Attribution under International Law A State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by an organ of the State or by actors exercising governmental authority on behalf of the State.³¹ A State may be held responsible under international law for cyber operations conducted by non-State actors if these are conducted on the direct instructions of the State or under its direction or effective control.³² It may be technically challenging to establish that a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n## 4.2 Due Diligence Furthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.³³ As a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment,³⁴ and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 ³¹ Cf. ILC ASR, in particular Articles 4, 5 and 7.\n³² See Article 8 ILC ASR. See also Nicaragua judgment, para 115, and Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, ICJ, judgment 27 February 2007, para. 400.\n³³ See Article 2 ILC ASR, which explicitly states that a State’s conduct may consist of ‘an action or omission’. See also Corfu Channel, ICJ, judgment 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁴ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 22 NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER The due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation.³⁵ Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations.³⁶ This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.³⁷ Norway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n³⁵ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁶ See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n³⁷ A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY ## 5 Response Measures The response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n## 5.1 Retorsion A State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n## 5.2 Countermeasures If a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act³⁸ as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.³⁹ If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response, NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 --- ³⁸ In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n³⁹ See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER The State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures.⁴⁰ Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n## 5-3 Necessity In a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n⁴⁰ ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488 NORWAY It should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.⁴¹ ## 5.4 Self-defence A State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality⁴², and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law **Key message:** *International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.* International humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*. Of particular relevance is the prohibition NORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488 ⁴¹ See Article 25 ILC ASR.\n⁴² See e.g. *Nicaragua* judgment paras. 176, 194, and *Oil Platforms*, ICJ, judgement 6 November 2003, paras. 43, 73-74, 76.\nNORWAY'S POSITION PAPER The general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44 Under IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace **Key message:** States must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488 NORWAY International human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n## Note from the publisher The author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.

There is a simple reason for that. International law regulates the conduct of states. Insofar as that conduct takes place in cyberspace, it may, just as conduct taking place in other domains of this world, be subject to international legal obligations. The application of international law in cyberspace was first recognised by the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2013,¹ and has been reconfirmed in subsequent consensus reports by the GGES in 2015² and 2021,³ and by the UN Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) in 2021.⁴ The reports have been adopted by the UN General Assembly, and are thus supported by all UN member States.\n\nIt is important to be clear about this point, especially because certain States continue to argue that we need a new legally binding instrument to regulate State activity in cyberspace. In the view of Norway and likeminded States, there is no need for a new convention on cyber security to set out the rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.

And that is the issue on the international agenda today, in line with the mandate of the current OEWG (2021-2025).⁵\n\nStates should therefore develop and publish national positions on how they interpret the rules of international law as applied to state conduct in cyberspace. Only States are in a position to clarify any potential grey zones through their cyber practices and by expressing what they consider to be their rights and obligations vis-à-vis other States (opinio juris). The development of national positions is therefore also essential for meaningful engagement at multilateral level.\n\nOnly 4-5 years ago, very few States had publicly expressed their views on how international law applies in cyberspace. The situation has now changed. Position papers from fifteen States were annexed to the final report of the latest GGE.⁶ And more position papers have followed. NATO has also contributed through political declarations setting out the common understanding of its (then) 30 allies. In addition, national statements from a broad range of States have been issued and made publicly available in connection with the previous and the current OEWG.\n\nNorway published its position paper in May 2021 as part of the participation by a Norwegian expert in the GGE, and as a contribution to an enhanced common understanding among States.⁷ The position paper was developed in cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the security services. As the title indicates, it sets out Norway's views on selected questions of international law relating to cyberspace. It was written in the context of international security, which was the focus of the parallel GGE and OEWG processes. It reflects the international legal debate, and has a particular focus on when a cyber operation is in violation of State sovereignty, the prohibition of intervention, and the prohibition on the use of force. It addresses State responsibility and the question of attribution of conduct to a State under international law, the obligation of due diligence and the response measures a targeted State is entitled to use under international law. Finally, it contains positions on the application of international humanitarian law, and on human rights in cyberspace. In order to\n\n⁵ See UN Doc.

    "NORWAY\n\nmake the paper easier to read and understand, it highlights key messages and includes practical examples.\n\nCertain issues need particular emphasis, and State sovereignty is one of them. The obligation to respect other States' sovereignty is probably the rule of international law most likely to be violated by a State's cyber operations. It therefore generated debate when it was claimed that no rule prohibiting violations of sovereignty could be extrapolated from the principle of sovereignty in the context of cyberspace. In line with an increasing number of states, Norway has therefore considered it important to make it clear that in its view, sovereignty is both a principle and a primary rule of international law that is applicable in cyberspace. This in turn means that a breach of the rule amounts to an internationally wrongful act, and if attributable to a State, may also give rise to State responsibility. To argue otherwise would mean that State activity normally considered to be in violation of sovereignty, may have to come under the definition of a prohibited intervention or even a prohibited use of force to be in violation of international law in a cyber context. If the State activity does not amount to an intervention or a use of force, it would also preclude the use of countermeasures by the injured state, since such measures may only be taken in response to an internationally wrongful act.\n\nUnlike most States that have addressed sovereignty, Norway has also expressly recognised that States can violate sovereignty in two ways. First, on the basis of territoriality, and second on the basis of interference with or usurpation of the inherently governmental functions of another State. As regards the latter, the paper makes clear that there is no requirement for there to be physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality. Whether or not a violation has occurred must be determined by a case-by-case assessment.\n\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on their territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for cyber operations that target third States, known as the obligation to exercise due diligence. This obligation is particularly relevant in a cyber context, and could to some extent compensate for the difficulties of attributing cyber operations to specific States. Similarly, since certain otherwise likeminded States have been unwilling to categorise due diligence as a legal obligation, Norway has considered it important to express its own view clearly: that there is a customary international law obligation to exercise due diligence, which also applies in cyberspace.\n\nAs regards international humanitarian law (IHL), Norway states clearly that it applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.\n\nThe reluctance of certain States to recognise the applicability of IHL to state conduct in cyberspace in the event of an armed conflict has had an effect on both the GGE and the OEWG processes, and was one of the main reasons why\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488",
    "NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n473\n\nthe GGE failed to adopt a consensus report in 2017. However, agreement on an explicit reference to the applicability of IHL as such, and not only to the fundamental principles of IHL, was reached in the 2021 GGE report⁸ and reiterated in the first annual progress report of the current OEWG in 2022.⁹ Now that consensus has been reached on the basics, there is an urgent need to discuss further how IHL applies to cyber operations. For instance, a common understanding should be sought as to whether digital data enjoys legal protection against damage and destruction similar to that afforded to physical objects. Strengthening a common understanding of the law would also weaken certain States' narrative that there is a need for a new cyber-specific convention.\n\nFinally, State responsibility and the issue of attribution is another important topic that may be highlighted. Unsurprisingly, it is controversial at the multilateral level, and particularly sensitive for states that are known to use cyber operations in violation of international law. For the same reason, it is also often presented as complex and unclear, without there necessarily being any intention to engage constructively in order to bring the discussions forward. In Norway's view, and as clearly stated in the paper, the general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities by States. It may be technically challenging to establish the facts of a case, for instance whether a relationship between a State and a non-State actor amounts to direct instructions, direction or effective control. However, this is a question of obtaining the evidence, and not of a lack of clarity in international law.\n\nInternational law is the foundation for peaceful co-existence. Upholding the international legal order is in the interest of all States. This applies to all areas of interstate relations, and cyberspace is no exception. An alleged need for a new cyber convention cannot be used as justification for non-compliance with existing international law. The Nordic countries, like all UN member states, should therefore continue to develop and share their interpretations (opinio juris) of how existing international law applies to practical situations in a cyber context, in order to promote common understanding. This is also capacity building in practice.\n\nMay, 2023\n\n8 UN Doc.

This has been recognised by the international community. The 2012-2013 United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (GGE)¹ concluded as much in its consensus report, and wrote as follows:\n\nInternational law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations, is applicable and is essential to maintaining peace and stability and promoting an open, secure, peaceful and accessible ICT environment.²\n\nThis was reconfirmed in the subsequent consensus report by the 2015 GGE, which also underscored that the UN Charter applies in its entirety.³ The UN General Assembly welcomed the 2015 report of the GGE in its resolution 70/237 and called upon Member States to be ‘guided in their use of information and communications technologies’ by the report.\n\nIn the Final Substantive Report of the Open-ended Working Group on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security (OEWG), all UN Member States reaffirmed the conclusions of previous GGEs that international law applies in cyberspace.⁴ Moreover, the report called upon States ‘to avoid and refrain from taking any measures not in accordance with international law, and in particular the Charter of the United Nations.’ The report also concluded that ‘further common understandings need to be developed on how international law applies to State use of ICTs.’\n\nCompliance with international law is fundamental for preserving international peace and security in cyberspace. In this paper, Norway sets out its views on the concrete application of certain rules of international law to State conduct in cyberspace, including practical examples, to contribute to a common understanding among States.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n\n1.

    "NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n475\n\nThe focus of this paper is on cyber activity that threatens international peace and security, and on issues of State sovereignty. However, numerous bilateral and multilateral treaties are also binding on States, and cyber activity perpetrated by or attributable to a State also has the potential to violate such obligations.\n\n## 2 The Application of International Law in Cyberspace\n\n**Key message:**\n*International law applies in cyberspace.*\n\nExisting international law, that is customary international law and international treaties, has not been developed with cyberspace in mind. However, the application of the rules of international law to new areas, for example in response to technological developments, is nothing new. If the law in certain areas is perceived as unclear when applied to activities in cyberspace, this must be resolved in the usual way through interpretation. This applies both to general international law, for instance the rules that relate to sovereignty and state responsibility, and to the specialised regimes of international law, such as international human rights law and international humanitarian law.\n\nNorway is of the view that there is no need for specific legal instruments to set out rights and obligations of States in respect of activities in cyberspace.\n\n## 3 Cyber Operations in Violation of International Law\n\n**Key message:**\n*One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.*\n\nCyber operations can vary widely in scope and intensity, from minor digital disruptions to armed attacks on a State. One of the conditions for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation is that the operation, or the failure to react against the operation, constitutes a breach of an international\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488",
    "NORWAY\n\nobligation of the State.¹⁴ The obligation in question may follow from customary international law or be treaty-based. A cyber operation is thus not unlawful *per se* but may become so when carried out to the detriment of the rights of other States.\n\nIn the following, Norway gives its interpretation of certain obligations of international law as they apply to cyber operations.¹⁵ The focus in Section 3 is on sovereignty, non-intervention and the prohibition on the use of force. The question of attribution of conduct to a State, which is the other condition for holding a State internationally responsible for a cyber operation, is dealt with in Section 4 (*State responsibility*). The measures a targeted State is entitled to use in response under international law are dealt with in Section 5 (*Response measures*). Section 6 discusses international humanitarian law as it applies to cyber operations in armed conflict, and Section 7 deals with the application of international human rights obligations in cyberspace.\n\n## 3.1 Sovereignty\n\n&gt; Key message:\n&gt; Sovereignty is not just a principle, but also a primary rule of international law.\n&gt; A State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State’s sovereignty.\n&gt; Whether a cyber operation violates the target State’s sovereignty depends on the nature of the operation, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, and must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe principle of sovereignty is one of the fundamental principles of international law and applies in cyberspace.¹⁶ It refers to the supreme authority of\n\n¹⁴ This is set out as one of two conditions in Article 2 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (ILC ASR). The Article is considered to express customary international law.\n\n¹⁵ This position paper does not contain any specific analysis of cyber espionage, that is cyber operations whose purpose and effect is limited to the mere collection of information for use by the authorities, which is not in itself illegal under international law. However, certain aspects of such intelligence operations could violate specific rules of international law.\n\n¹⁶ *Island of Palmas case* (USA v Netherlands), arbitral award, 4 April 1928: *Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence.

The external dimension includes the right of the State to decide its foreign policy and to enter into international agreements. Both dimensions of sovereignty apply in cyberspace, subject only to obligations under international law.\n\nNorway is of the view that sovereignty constitutes both an international law principle from which various rules derive, such as the prohibition of intervention and the prohibition of the use of force, and a primary rule in its own right capable of being violated.¹⁷ Thus, cyber operations that do not amount to a prohibited intervention or a prohibited use of force may nevertheless amount to a violation of a State's sovereignty under international law.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has consistently held that States have an obligation to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of other States as a matter of international law. In a cyber context this means that a State must not conduct cyber operations that violate another State's sovereignty.\n\nA cyber operation that manifests itself on another State's territory may, depending on its nature, the scale of the intrusion and its consequences, constitute a violation of sovereignty.\n\nCausing physical damage by cyber means on another State's territory may easily qualify as a violation of territorial sovereignty. For example, a cyber operation against an industrial control system at a petrochemical plant that led to a malfunction and a subsequent fire would constitute a violation of the State's territorial sovereignty. In addition to physical damage, causing cyber infrastructure to lose functionality may also be taken into consideration and may amount to a violation. This includes the use of crypto viruses to encrypt data and thus render them unusable for a substantial period of time.\n\nThe principle of sovereignty encompasses cyber infrastructure located in a State's territory irrespective of whether it is governmental or private.\n\n¹⁷ *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America), 'Nicaragua case', International Court of Justice (ICJ), judgment 27 June 1986, paras. 15, 212-213 and 292.*\n\nglobe is the right to exercise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State; p. 838.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488",
    "NORWAY\n\nSimilarly, a cyber operation that interferes with or usurps the inherently governmental functions of another State may constitute a violation of sovereignty.¹⁸\n\nThis is based on the premise that a State enjoys the exclusive right to exercise within its territory, 'to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State'.¹⁹ Accordingly, what matters is not whether physical damage, injury, or loss of functionality has resulted, but whether the cyber operation has interfered with data or services that are necessary for the exercise of inherently governmental functions. Cases in point would include altering or deleting data or blocking digital communication between public bodies and citizens so as to interfere with the delivery of social services, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes, or the performance of key national defence activities. Another example could be the manipulation of police communications so that patrol cars are unable to communicate with police dispatch/operation centres. In this context it is irrelevant whether the inherently governmental function is performed by central, regional or local governments and authorities, or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments or authorities. Conducting elections is a clear example of an inherently governmental function. In contrast to the case of a cyber operation in breach of the prohibition of intervention, there is no requirement for the interference to reach to the level of coercion.\n\nThe precise threshold of what constitute a cyber operation in violation of sovereignty is not settled in international law, and will depend on a case-by-case assessment.\n\n## 3.2 The Prohibition of Intervention\n\n**Key message:**\n\nCyber operations that compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé), will constitute an intervention in violation of international law.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n\n¹⁸ See Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 4, p. 21-22, paras. 15-16.\n¹⁹ *Island of Palmas* arbitral award, p. 838.",
    "NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n479\n\nThe prohibition of intervention applies to a State's cyber operations as it does to other State activities.²⁰ Accordingly, a State must not carry out cyber operations in breach of the prohibition of intervention, according to customary international law.²¹\n\nA cyber operation must therefore not be carried out to compel the target State to take a course of action, whether by act or omission, in a way that it would not otherwise voluntarily have pursued (coercion) in matters relating to its internal or external affairs (domaine réservé) – such as a State's political, economic, social or cultural system or the formulation of its foreign policy.²² The constituent element of coercion means that cyber activities that are merely influential or persuasive will not qualify as illegal intervention.\n\nHolding elections is an example of a matter within a State's domaine réservé. Thus, carrying out cyber operations with the intent of altering election results in another State, for example by manipulating election systems or unduly influencing public opinion through the dissemination of confidential information obtained through cyber operations ('hack and leak'), would be in violation of the prohibition of intervention. Another example is a cyber operation deliberately causing a temporary shutdown of the target State's critical infrastructure, such as the power supply or TV, radio, Internet or other telecommunications infrastructure in order to compel that State to take a course of action.\n\n## 3-3 Prohibition on the Use of Force\n\n**Key message:**\n\nA cyber operation may, depending on its scale and effects, violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\nA cyber operation that is in violation of the prohibition on the threat or use of force may, depending on its scale and effects, constitute an armed attack under international law. An armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n\n---\n\n²⁰ Norway recognises that no State seems to object to the application of the prohibition on intervention (or rule of non-intervention) in the cyber context. Reference is made to the GGE 2015 report, para. 26 and 28(b), subsequently endorsed by the GA. However, Norway is aware that there are differences of opinion as to where the threshold for breach lies.\n\n²¹ Nicaragua judgment, para. 202.\n\n²² Nicaragua judgment, para. 205.",
    "NORWAY\n\nArticle 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force by a State against the territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the UN. The prohibition is a norm of customary international law.²³ It applies to any use of force, regardless of the weapons or means employed.²⁴\n\nThere are only three exceptions to the prohibition on the use of force in the sense that using force would not be in violation of international law: if the state on whose territory the use of force takes place consents; if it is authorised by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the UN Charter; or in the case of self-defence, in response to an armed attack as recognised in Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nWhether a cyber operation violates the prohibition on the threat or use of force in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter depends on its scale and effects, physical or otherwise.²⁵ Depending on its gravity, a cyber operation may also constitute an armed attack under international law.²⁶,²⁷ In accordance with the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), an armed attack is the gravest form of the use of force.²⁸\n\nA cyber operation may constitute use of force or even an armed attack if its scale and effects are comparable to those of the use of force or an armed attack by conventional means. This must be determined based on a case-by-case assessment having regard to the specific circumstances. A number of factors may be taken into consideration, such as the severity of the consequences (the level of harm inflicted), immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability, military character, State involvement, the nature of the target (such as critical infrastructure) and whether this category of action has generally been characterised as the use of force.²⁹ This list is not exhaustive.\n\n²³ Nicaragua judgment, paras. 188-190.\n\n²⁴ See Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, ICJ, advisory opinion 8 July 1996, para. 39.\n\n²⁵ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195, where ICJ stated that the ‘scale and effects’ are to be considered when assessing whether particular actions constitute an ‘armed attack’. The factors are equally useful and logical when determining whether a cyber operation constitutes the use of force according to Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.\n\n²⁶ Nicaragua judgment, para. 195.\n\n²⁷ A cyber operation that constitutes an armed attack on a State under international law triggers the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.

    "NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n481\n\nCyber operations that cause death or injury to persons or physical damage to or the destruction of objects could clearly amount to the use of force. Likewise, a cyber operation causing severe disruption to the functioning of the State such as the use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against governmental or private power grid- or telecommunications infrastructure, or cyber operations leading to the destruction of stockpiles of Covid-19 vaccines, could amount to the use of force in violation of Article 2(4). Similarly, the use of crypto viruses or other forms of digital sabotage against a State's financial and banking system, or other operations that cause widespread economic effects and destabilisation, may amount to the use of force in violation of Article 2(4).\n\nA cyber operation that severely damages or disables a State's critical infrastructure or functions may furthermore be considered as amounting to an armed attack under international law. Depending on its scale and effect, this may include a cyber operation that causes an aircraft crash.\n\n## 4 State Responsibility\n\n**Key message:**\n\nIn order for a State to be held internationally responsible for a cyber operation, the operation has to be attributable to the State under international law.\n\nA State may also be held responsible under international law if it possesses knowledge of a cyber operation that is being carried out from its territory and causing serious adverse consequences with respect to a right of the target State under international law, and fails to take reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation.\n\nThe general rules on State responsibility under international law apply to cyber operations just as they apply to other activities.\n\nIn order for a State to be held responsible for a cyber operation under international law, it is a condition that the cyber operation is attributable to the State under international law.³⁰ Both State and non-State actors conduct cyber operations. Even if a cyber operation is not conducted by someone acting\n\n³⁰ The condition is set out in Article 2 ILC ASR.

However, this is a question of evidence, and not of lack of clarity of international law.\n\n## 4.2 Due Diligence\n\nFurthermore, a State may be held responsible under international law if it knows or should have known that cyber operations that target third States are being carried out from or via its territory, and fails to take adequate measures.³³\n\nAs a consequence of the right to exercise sovereignty over cyber infrastructure located on its territory, States also have a corresponding obligation not to knowingly allow their territory to be used for acts causing significant harm to the rights of other States under international law. This customary international law obligation, often referred to as the due diligence principle, was recognised by the ICJ in the 1949 Corfu Channel judgment,³⁴ and is reflected in numerous rules in specialised regimes of international law. Norway is of the view that the due diligence obligation applies in situations where there is a risk of transboundary harm from hazardous activities, regardless of the nature of the activity, and accordingly also applies to cyber operations.\n\nAccordingly, if a State possesses knowledge of a cyber operation being carried out from or via its territory causing serious adverse consequences with\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n\n³¹ Cf.

    "NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n483\n\nrespect to a right of the target State under international law, it is required to take adequate measures to address the situation.\n\nThe due diligence standard is the conduct that is generally considered to be appropriate and proportional to the degree of risk of transboundary harm in the particular instance. It is an obligation of conduct, not of result. Applied to cyber activities, what is required is for the State to take all reasonably available measures to terminate the cyber operation. A breach of the obligation consists not of failing to achieve the desired result, but of failing to take the necessary, diligent steps towards that end. It is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by a third State or a non-State actor. Likewise, it is irrelevant whether the cyber operation in question is conducted by an actor physically present on the State's territory or by an actor making remote use of ICT infrastructure on the State's territory.\n\nIn addition to actual knowledge of the use of cyber infrastructure within its territory for harmful cyber operations against another State, a State may also violate its due diligence obligation if it is in fact unaware of the activities in question but objectively should have known about them and fails to address the situation.³⁵ Accordingly, knowledge also encompasses those situations in which a State in the normal course of events would have become aware that its territory was being used for harmful cyber operations.³⁶ This implies that the criterion that a State 'should have known' is more likely to be met if for instance the operation used publicly known and easily detected malware, as opposed to highly sophisticated and previously unknown malware.\n\nThere is currently no legal basis for a general obligation to prevent cyber operations, and States are consequently not under an obligation to monitor all cyber activities on their territories.³⁷\n\nNorway considers the due diligence obligation to be of particular importance in a cyber context. In situations where a targeted State cannot directly attribute (technically and legally) a wrongful cyber operation – for instance election interference – to the State from whose territory it is being carried out, the territorial State may nevertheless still be held accountable on the basis of a breach of the due diligence obligation.\n\n³⁵ Corfu Channel judgment, 9 April 1949, p. 18.\n³⁶ See also Tallinn Manual 2.0, commentary to Rule 6, p. 41.\n³⁷ A general obligation of full control and prevention in the cyber context could be problematic in relation to a State's obligations under international human rights law.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488",
    "NORWAY\n\n## 5 Response Measures\n\nThe response measures an injured State may take under international law depend on the severity and nature of the cyber operation and on whether the legally responsible actor behind it is another State or a non-State actor.\n\n## 5.1 Retorsion\n\nA State may respond to any form of cyber operation by retorsion. Retorsion refers to the taking of measures that are lawful but unfriendly, directed against another State. Retorsion may therefore be used regardless of whether international law has been violated and regardless of whether State responsibility applies. Examples of acts of retorsion are breaking off or limiting diplomatic relations, for instance by declaring a diplomat persona non grata, or the imposition of sanctions. Publicly declaring that another State is responsible for a cyber operation is in itself an act of retorsion.\n\n## 5.2 Countermeasures\n\nIf a State is the victim of an internationally wrongful cyber operation and another State can be held responsible under customary international law on State responsibility, the injured State may, depending on the circumstances, be entitled to take countermeasures.\n\nA countermeasure is an act that would otherwise be contrary to international law, but where the injured State can invoke the prior internationally wrongful act³⁸ as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.³⁹ If there is doubt regarding the attribution of a cyber operation to a State under international law, it may be preferable for the injured State to make use of acts of retorsion rather than countermeasures in order to avoid the possibility of incurring State responsibility for its response.\n\nCountermeasures may only be taken to induce a State to cease an internationally wrongful act or resume its compliance with an international obligation. They are not to be used for punishment and retaliation. Countermeasures must be limited to what is considered necessary and proportional, and may only target the State to which the cyber operation or internationally wrongful act can be attributed. There is no requirement for countermeasures to be of the same nature as the internationally wrongful acts to which they are a response,\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488\n\n---\n\n³⁸ In this document, ‘internationally wrongful acts’ must be understood as including both actions and omissions, see Articles 1 and 2 ILC ASR.\n\n³⁹ See Articles 22 and 49–54 ILC ASR.",
    "NORWAY'S POSITION PAPER\n485\n\nand countermeasures in response to cyber operations may therefore be carried out within or outside cyberspace. Countermeasures must not violate the prohibition on the threat or use of force or international humanitarian law.\n\nThe State held responsible should be notified of both the violation of international law and the grounds for attribution, as well as of the intention to introduce countermeasures.⁴⁰ Countermeasures may only be taken if a State has sufficient grounds for attributing the conduct in question to a particular State under international law. What constitutes sufficient grounds will be fact-specific and case-specific, and can be particularly challenging to determine in the case of cyber operations. The State taking countermeasures must be confident in its attribution before resorting to countermeasures. However, the State taking countermeasures need not publish detailed grounds for its attribution or give a detailed technical account of this to the State identified as responsible as this might reveal sensitive methods of interception and detection or offensive and defensive capabilities.\n\nCountermeasures may be taken without prior notification to the responsible State if providing such notification might reveal sensitive methods or capabilities or prevent the countermeasures from having the necessary effect. For example, the injured State could carry out a cyber operation to disrupt the capability of the aggressor State conducting the internationally wrongful cyber operation such as election interference. This countermeasure would in other circumstances be in violation of the aggressor State's sovereignty.\n\n## 5-3 Necessity\n\nIn a situation of necessity, a State may be able to respond to a cyber operation in a way that is in principle in breach of an international obligation and nevertheless not incur responsibility for its actions under international law.\n\nNecessity refers to those exceptional situations where the only way a State can safeguard an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, whether cyber in nature or not, is by temporary non-compliance with international obligations of lesser weight or urgency. For instance, if infrastructure in a third country is used in an internationally wrongful cyber operation, the injured State may under certain conditions launch a cyber operation to destroy or disrupt the internationally wrongful cyber operation, even if this violates the territorial sovereignty of the third State.\n\nIt is not a requirement that the preceding cyber operation must be attributable to a particular State.\n\n⁴⁰ ILC ASR Articles 43 and 52.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470–488",
    "NORWAY\n\nIt should be emphasised that, according to customary law on state responsibility, a number of conditions must be fulfilled before necessity can be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness.⁴¹\n\n## 5.4 Self-defence\n\nA State that is the victim of a cyber operation that qualifies as an armed attack under international law, may exercise its inherent right of individual or collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nThe right of self-defence as reflected in Article 51 is a norm of customary international law. It must be exercised subject to the requirements of necessity and proportionality⁴², and may involve both digital and conventional means.\n\n## 6 Cyber Operations during Armed Conflicts – International Humanitarian Law\n\n**Key message:**\n\n*International humanitarian law applies to cyber operations in connection with an armed conflict.*\n\nInternational humanitarian law (IHL) applies in the event of an armed conflict. Whether an (international or non-international) armed conflict exists will depend on the specific circumstances.\n\nThis specialised regime of international law, also called *jus in bello*, governs actions, including cyber operations, when they are conducted in connection with an armed conflict.\n\nInternational humanitarian law aims to minimise the human suffering caused by armed conflict. It thus regulates and limits cyber operations during armed conflicts, just as it regulates and limits the use of any other weapons, means and methods of warfare in an armed conflict.\n\nIHL does not legitimise the use of force in cyberspace. Any use of force by States – either by digital or by conventional means – remains governed by the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of customary international law, also called *jus ad bellum*.

International disputes must be settled by peaceful means, in cyberspace as in all other domains.\n\nThe general rules for legitimate military targets are the same regardless of whether conventional or digital means are used. A cyber operation conducted in connection with an armed conflict must be assessed according to its consequences, and may qualify as an attack under international humanitarian law. 'Attack' is a key concept of international humanitarian law, and is understood to mean 'acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or defence'.43 Cyber attacks during armed conflicts are subject to the same restrictions and regulations under international humanitarian law as conventional attacks, including the principles of humanity, military necessity, proportionality and distinction. The concept of attack is particularly relevant to the rules and principles on the selection of targets and precautions. Attacks against civilians or civilian objects are for example prohibited.44\n\nUnder IHL, medical services must be protected and respected, including when carrying out cyber operations during armed conflict.45 IHL also prohibits attacking, destroying, removing or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the population, including through cyber means and methods of warfare.46 'Objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population' include ICT infrastructure for food production or drinking water installations.\n\n## 7 Human Rights in Cyberspace\n\n**Key message:**\nStates must comply with their human rights obligations in cyberspace, just as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights.\n\n43 Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflict (AP I), Article 49(1).\n44 AP I, Article 51(2) and 52(1).\n45 See, for instance, Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (GCI), Article 19; Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (GCII), Article 12; Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (GCIV), Article 18; AP I, Article 12; AP II, Article 11; ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rules 25, 28, 29.\n46 AP I, Article 54; Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (AP II), Article 14; ICRC Customary IHL Study, Rule 54.\n\nNORDIC JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW 92 (2023) 470-488",
    "NORWAY\n\nInternational human rights law applies to cyber activities just as it does to any other activity. States must comply with their human rights obligations also in cyberspace, as they must in the physical world. States must both respect and protect human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.\n\nNeither the individuals that are subject to a State's jurisdiction, nor the concept of jurisdiction, is altered by the fact that the activity attributed to the State is a cyber activity. In this respect, cyber activity is no different from other means that States may use to violate their human rights obligations towards their citizens.\n\n## Note from the publisher\n\nThe author mentioned at the start of this article, Vibeke Musæus, is only responsible for the introduction to this position paper.
