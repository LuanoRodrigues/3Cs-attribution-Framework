We can either work together to realize their potential for greater prosperity and security or we can succumb to narrow interests and undue fears that limit progress. Cybersecurity is not an end unto itself; it is instead an obligation that our governments and societies must take on willingly, to ensure that innovation continues to flourish, drive markets and improve lives.¹\n\n—President Barack Obama\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nFirst I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.²\n\n—Carl von Clausewitz\n\nZero-Day³: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before.⁴ A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code.⁵ A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign.⁶ By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n\n¹ THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4 (May 2011), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n\n² CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n\n³ See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n\n⁴ See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR (April 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n\n⁵ Id.\n\n⁶ Id.\n\n168 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68",

Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications.⁸ Experts warned:\n\n[T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage . . . . The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.⁹\n\nThe advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\n\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace.¹⁰ He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers.

In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.”¹¹ Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”¹²\n\nThe danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth.¹³ These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities.¹⁴ Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful.¹⁵ It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful.¹⁶ To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment.¹⁷ Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease.¹⁸ Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence.

U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the .mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure.²⁰ As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes:\n\nThis near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.²¹\n\nCyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks.²² Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work . . . from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”²³\n\nSecuring the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”).²⁴ Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial.

Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”²⁵\n\nCyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace.²⁶ The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain.²⁷ As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains.²⁸ The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs.²⁹ The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks.³⁰ Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks.³¹ Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.³²\n\nWhile the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\n\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues.

Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n\n## II. THE FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF CYBER 3.0\n\n### A. The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential\n\nThe approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.³³\n\n#### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\n\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”³⁴\n\nThe importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as:\n\n³³ Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n\n³⁴ *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.³⁵\n\nBy treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.”³⁶ In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”³⁷\n\nWhile understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined\n\nThere has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*.³⁸ Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”³⁹ This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself.

Cyberspace is:\n\nAn operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.⁴⁰\n\nThis definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n\n## 3. Internet Architecture\n\nA rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.⁴¹\n\nAt its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world.⁴² The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services.⁴³ By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and\n\nCyber 3.0 175",

Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\n\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices.⁴⁵ Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction.⁴⁶ Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”⁴⁷\n\nWhat was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”⁴⁸\n\nThe Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer).⁴⁹ Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n\n*Physical Layer*.

This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function.⁵¹ While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”⁵²—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.”⁵³ The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.”⁵⁴ With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs.⁵⁵ This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace\n\nThe emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event.⁵⁶ One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains.⁵⁷ This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as\n\n⁵¹ LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n⁵² Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n⁵³ *Id.*\n⁵⁴ *Id.*\n⁵⁵ Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n⁵⁶ See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6 (Nov 2008), available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n⁵⁷ Colonel Michael S.

It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct . . .⁶⁰\n\nSome commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated:\n\nThe United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.⁶¹\n\nChanging the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.⁶²\n\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68",

Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain\n\nBased on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n\n## B.

Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic.⁶⁷ Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design.⁶⁸ Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks.⁶⁹ Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic.

General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\n\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75\n\nSo it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\n\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of\n\nCyber 3.0 181",

Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the .mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter . . . active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81\n\nThe development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over .mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\n\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n\n182 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\n\n77 Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35.\n78 Id.\n79 David E.

According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^[85]^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the .mil, .gov and .com domains.^[86]^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^[87]^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^[88]^\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the .com and .gov domains while the DOD secures the .mil domain.^[89]^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^[90]^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be\n\nCyber 3.0 183",

These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated,\n\n&gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.⁹²\n\nGovernment agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated.⁹³ Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.⁹⁴\n\nThe question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.”⁹⁵ How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties?

The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity*\n\n*Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*⁹⁶\n\nCyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world.⁹⁷ According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.”⁹⁸ Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”⁹⁹\n\nBuilding a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.”¹⁰⁰ By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed.¹⁰¹ Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\n\nDistributed systems require distributed action.¹⁰² This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world.¹⁰³ Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies.

The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation\n\nThe nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.¹⁰⁶\n\nThe United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.”¹⁰⁷ The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat.¹⁰⁸ According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.”¹⁰⁹ The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander:\n\nPurely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.¹¹⁰\n\nNot only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses\n\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at 13.\n\n¹⁰⁵ Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n\n¹⁰⁶ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n\n¹⁰⁷ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n\n¹⁰⁸ *Id.* at 104-107.\n\n¹⁰⁹ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n\n¹¹⁰ Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n\n186 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68",

This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”¹¹¹\n\nA cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace . . . we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.”¹¹² The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\n\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.”¹¹³ From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained.¹¹⁴ Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED)\n\nTo exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki,\n\nDeterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.¹¹⁶\n\nA narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation.¹¹⁷ This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\n\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy,¹¹⁸ deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.”¹¹⁹ He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.”¹²⁰ Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”¹²¹\n\nDeterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011:\n\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.¹²³\n\nUnfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”¹²⁴\n\nAttribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁵ To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?”¹²⁶ Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”¹²⁷\n\nThe traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n\n¹²² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n¹²³ Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n¹²⁴ Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66, (Spring 2011), available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n¹²⁵ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n¹²⁶ General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War\n\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\n\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”¹²⁸ Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action . . . as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.”¹²⁹ Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”¹³⁰ Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\n\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force\n\n¹²⁸ U.N.

According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.”¹³² This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.”¹³³ Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack.¹³⁴ Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”¹³⁵\n\nThe true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach.¹³⁶ Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force.¹³⁷ Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.”¹³⁸ In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force.¹³⁹ These criteria are:\n\n(1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\n\nCyber 3.0 191",

As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\n\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\n\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have.¹⁴⁰ For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\n\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.¹⁴¹\n\nWhat limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack.¹⁴² Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51.

It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems.¹⁴³ This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\n\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states.¹⁴⁴ Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.¹⁴⁵\n\nBefore a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\n\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\n\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders.¹⁴⁶ The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks.¹⁴⁸ Regardless, however, of what level\n\n¹⁴³ Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n¹⁴⁴ Hollis, supra note 46.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.”¹⁴⁹ It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.”¹⁵⁰ For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.”¹⁵¹ Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach:\n\nOur strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.¹⁵²\n\nWhile deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources . . . nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.”¹⁵³ In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace.¹⁵⁵ The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers.¹⁵⁶ One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\n\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.”¹⁵⁷ Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”¹⁵⁸\n\nWhile development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a\n\n¹⁵⁴ Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”¹⁶⁰\n\nOne such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks.¹⁶¹ What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\n\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework\n\nIt is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery)\n\n¹⁵⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n¹⁶⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n¹⁶¹ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E.

Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.¹⁶³\n\nOn June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.”¹⁶⁴ The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?”¹⁶⁵ Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\n\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed:¹⁶⁶ These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\n\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation.

Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.”¹⁶⁸ For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\n\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive.¹⁶⁹ This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically.¹⁷⁰ Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks.¹⁷¹ An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.”¹⁷² For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.¹⁷³\n\nFinally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks.¹⁷⁴ For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory.

The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack.¹⁷⁶ This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack.¹⁷⁷ It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.¹⁷⁸\n\nUnderstanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\n\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin.¹⁷⁹ However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations.¹⁸⁰ Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated.¹⁸¹ According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations,\n\nAs with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks.

The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\n\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance.¹⁸³ In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence.¹⁸⁴ Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁸⁵ Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code.¹⁸⁶ This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.”¹⁸⁷ In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\n\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity.

The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W.

Timing can be broken down into four categories:¹⁹⁴ (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor.¹⁹⁵ Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker.¹⁹⁶ “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.”¹⁹⁷ This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\n\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology.¹⁹⁸ In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role.¹⁹⁹ When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists.²⁰⁰ Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks.²⁰¹ This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.²⁰²\n\n*Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction.

Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.”²⁰³ For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.²⁰⁴\n\n*Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”²⁰⁵\n\nA framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\n\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.”²⁰⁶ The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes,\n\n&gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely\n\n²⁰³ *Id.*\n\n²⁰⁴ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n\n²⁰⁵ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n\n²⁰⁶ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n\n204 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68",

But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.²⁰⁷\n\nWhile attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors.²⁰⁸ Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers.²⁰⁹ Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain.²¹⁰ Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n\n## IV.

Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.²¹¹\n\nDeveloping a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.²¹²\n\nThere remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.”²¹³ Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect.²¹⁴ A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.”²¹⁵ In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now.

We can either work together to realize their potential for greater prosperity and security or we can succumb to narrow interests and undue fears that limit progress.

INTRODUCTION\nFirst I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.²\n—Carl von Clausewitz\nZero-Day³: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before.⁴ A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code.⁵ A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign.⁶ By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n¹ THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4 (May 2011), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n² CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n³ See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n⁴ See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR (April 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n⁵ Id.\n⁶ Id.\n168 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nStuxnet was designed not to steal information; rather it was designed to infiltrate Iranian industrial control systems (ICS), closed systems, specifically those that controlled nuclear centrifuges and take control.⁷ Once inside the operating system, Stuxnet had the ability to cause nuclear centrifuges to spin out of control by altering their rotational speed and causing the speed to fluctuate wildly. Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications.⁸ Experts warned:\n[T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage . . . . The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.⁹\nThe advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace.¹⁰ He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers.

In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.”¹¹ Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”¹²\nThe danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth.¹³ These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities.¹⁴ Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful.¹⁵ It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful.¹⁶ To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment.¹⁷ Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease.¹⁸ Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence. Skilled attackers can hold military or national security systems at risk, but their activities can\n¹¹ Arthur K.

U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the .mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure.²⁰ As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes:\nThis near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.²¹\nCyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks.²² Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work . . . from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”²³\nSecuring the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”).²⁴ Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial. Cyber 3.0 proposes to make U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more robust, resilient, and redundant, thereby denying the benefit of\n¹⁹ Lynn, *supra* note 13.\n²⁰ Lynn, *supra* note 10.\n²¹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks*, 88 TEX.

The strategy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities and acknowledges the growing cyber threat environment: “The Department and nation have vulnerabilities in cyberspace. Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”²⁵\nCyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace.²⁶ The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain.²⁷ As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains.²⁸ The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs.²⁹ The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks.³⁰ Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks.³¹ Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.³²\nWhile the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues.

Hence, this article proposes that the U.S. pursue a sixth initiative as part of its cyber strategy—develop a framework of attribution capabilities.\nAfter discussing the five strategic initiatives, the current state of international law and the law of war in the context of the cyber domain, this article will explore the capabilities and technical limitations of attribution. Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n## II. THE FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF CYBER 3.0\n### A. The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential\nThe approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.³³\n#### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”³⁴\nThe importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as:\n³³ Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n³⁴ *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H.

It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.³⁵\nBy treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.”³⁶ In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”³⁷\nWhile understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined\nThere has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*.³⁸ Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”³⁹ This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself. That is, it should\n174 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nrecognize the means and manner in which networks communicate, not simply provide a description of the physical infrastructure and architecture.\nThis article offers a definition that builds on the concept of the behavior of the domain and how its distinct architecture makes it unique amongst the war-fighting domains. Cyberspace is:\nAn operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.⁴⁰\nThis definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n## 3. Internet Architecture\nA rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.⁴¹\nAt its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world.⁴² The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services.⁴³ By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and\nCyber 3.0 175\nservices on top of a variety of networking technologies.⁴⁴ The Internet employs a packet-switched network as part of its fundamental architecture. Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices.⁴⁵ Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction.⁴⁶ Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”⁴⁷\nWhat was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”⁴⁸\nThe Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer).⁴⁹ Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n*Physical Layer*. According to Lawrence Lessig, “The Internet is a communication system. It consists of three layers. At the bottom, the physical layer, are wires and computers, and wires linking computers.”⁵⁰ The physical layer\n⁴⁴ *Id.*\n⁴⁵ *Id.*\n⁴⁶ Duncan B. Hollis, *An e-SoS for Cyberspace*, 52 HARV.

This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function.⁵¹ While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”⁵²—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.”⁵³ The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.”⁵⁴ With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs.⁵⁵ This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace\nThe emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event.⁵⁶ One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains.⁵⁷ This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as\n⁵¹ LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n⁵² Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n⁵³ *Id.*\n⁵⁴ *Id.*\n⁵⁵ Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n⁵⁶ See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6 (Nov 2008), available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n⁵⁷ Colonel Michael S. Simpson, *Cyber Domain Evolving in Concept, But Stymied by Slow Implementation*, U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE 2 (2010).\nCyber 3.0 177\na vector for attack—and much of the general public’s view of cyberspace as a benign daily companion.⁵⁸\nAccording to Dr. Daniel Kuehl, “In a very real sense cyberspace is a designed environment, created with the very specific intent of facilitating the use and exploitation of information, human interaction and intercommunication.”⁵⁹ Dr. Martin Libicki, Senior Management Scientist of the RAND Corporation states,\nCyberspace is a thing of contrasts: It is a space and is thus similar to such other media of contention as the land and sea. It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct . . .⁶⁰\nSome commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated:\nThe United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.⁶¹\nChanging the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.⁶²\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nAny understanding of the cyber domain must account for its dynamic design, behavior, and the many technologies which constitute it. Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain\nBased on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n## B. The Second Strategic Initiative: Employ New Defense Operating Concepts to Protect DOD Networks and Systems\nProtecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and other attacks.66\nCyber 3.0 179\nIn cyberspace, the only “absolute” defense is an unrealistic one: that is, to unplug from networks completely, step out of the matrix, thereby forfeiting the innumerable benefits the cyber domain offers. Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic.⁶⁷ Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design.⁶⁸ Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks.⁶⁹ Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic. Cyberspace is an offense dominant environment and therefore active defenses are required to address emerging security concerns.⁷⁰\nThe DOD’s new cyber operating concepts are based on performing four “steps”:⁷¹\n(1) Enhancing cyber hygiene best practices to improve its cyber security;\n(2) Detering and mitigating insider threats, strengthening workforce communications, workforce accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities;\n(3) Developing new defense operating concepts and computing architectures;\n⁶⁷ As the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, General Alexander noted, “There no longer remains the option to unplug from cyberspace as the information it provides has become the lifeblood of our society.” U.S. Cyber Command: Organizing For Cyberspace Operations: Hearing Before H.

They work by placing scanning technology at the interface of military networks and the open Internet to detect and stop malicious code before it passes into military networks. Active defenses now protect all defense and intelligence networks in the “.mil domain.” For the most part active defenses are classified though programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine have entered the public domain. See JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE: MAPPING THE CYBER UNDERWORLD 46 (2010). See also Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Skelrov, *Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent*, 201 MIL. L. REV 1, 2 (2009) (discussing active defenses).\n⁷¹ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 6.\n180 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\n(4) Employing an active cyber defense capability to prevent intrusions onto networks and systems.\nTo better understand the concept of active defense, it is essential to understand the limitations of passive defense commonly and derisively described as “patch &amp; pray.” Passive defense methods such as firewalls, patches, and antivirus software offer measures of security that often fall short as they cannot keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of cyber threats. General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75\nSo it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of\nCyber 3.0 181\nthree distinct phases: intrusion detection, traceback, and counterstrike capabilities.77 IP traceback is a technical/forensic method of tracking an IP packet across the internet, permitting a victim of an attack to follow digital bread crumbs back to the initial attacker. Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the .mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter . . . active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81\nThe development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over .mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n182 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\n77 Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35.\n78 Id.\n79 David E.

The Third Strategic Initiative: Partner with Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies and the Private Sector to Enable a Whole-of-Government Cybersecurity Strategy\nA robust, defensible infrastructure will depend on shaping the technologies employed, the obligations of operators of key networks and infrastructures, and the ability to coordinate government-private sector investment and response to attacks.^[84]^\nThe cyber domain poses asymmetric and evolving threats to both the military and private sectors. According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^[85]^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the .mil, .gov and .com domains.^[86]^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^[87]^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^[88]^\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the .com and .gov domains while the DOD secures the .mil domain.^[89]^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^[90]^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be\nCyber 3.0 183\ndone in terms of cooperation and collaboration. A collaborative industry-government framework must be put in place where private sector strengths (such as innovation and new technologies) are also drawn upon during times of attack.⁹¹\nTraditionally, government responses to cyber threats depend on where the threat originates and the sector that is being targeted. These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated,\n&gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.⁹²\nGovernment agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated.⁹³ Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.⁹⁴\nThe question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.”⁹⁵ How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties? While outside the scope of this article, developing complete answers to these questions are at the forefront of policymaking concerns.\n184 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nD. The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity*\n*Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*⁹⁶\nCyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world.⁹⁷ According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.”⁹⁸ Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”⁹⁹\nBuilding a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.”¹⁰⁰ By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed.¹⁰¹ Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\nDistributed systems require distributed action.¹⁰² This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world.¹⁰³ Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies. In addition to providing better tracking capabilities of\n⁹⁶ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 21.\n⁹⁷ *Id.* at 3.\n⁹⁸ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n⁹⁹ Miller, *supra* note 34, at 7.\n¹⁰⁰ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 9.\n¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 7.\n¹⁰² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 11.\n¹⁰³ *Id.*\nCyber 3.0 185\nthreats, collective defenses may also be employed to create a cyber threat early warning system which will allow member states to alert one another to cross-border cyber threats.¹⁰⁴ Some commentators have recommended that a duty to assist (akin to a maritime SOS) be created to foster a more immediate and directed response to cyber attacks.¹⁰⁵ Despite the many benefits of international collaboration, collective defenses or the possibility of an international duty to assist, responding to a cyber attack still requires some level of attribution.\nE. The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation\nThe nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.¹⁰⁶\nThe United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.”¹⁰⁷ The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat.¹⁰⁸ According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.”¹⁰⁹ The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander:\nPurely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.¹¹⁰\nNot only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at 13.\n¹⁰⁵ Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n¹⁰⁶ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n¹⁰⁷ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n¹⁰⁸ *Id.* at 104-107.\n¹⁰⁹ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n¹¹⁰ Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n186 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\non developing a streamlined acquisition process to keep pace with the racing life cycle of technological development. “It currently takes the Department of Defense approximately eighty-one months to make new computing systems operational. This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”¹¹¹\nA cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace . . . we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.”¹¹² The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.”¹¹³ From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained.¹¹⁴ Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED)\nTo exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor. This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.¹¹⁵\nThe five strategic initiatives of Cyber 3.0 make clear that cyberspace is the emerging threat environment of the 21st century.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki,\nDeterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.¹¹⁶\nA narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation.¹¹⁷ This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy,¹¹⁸ deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.”¹¹⁹ He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.”¹²⁰ Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”¹²¹\nDeterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense . . . We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable\n¹¹⁶ W.W.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.¹²³\nUnfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”¹²⁴\nAttribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁵ To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?”¹²⁶ Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”¹²⁷\nThe traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n¹²² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n¹²³ Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n¹²⁴ Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66, (Spring 2011), available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n¹²⁵ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n¹²⁶ General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”¹²⁸ Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action . . . as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.”¹²⁹ Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”¹³⁰ Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force\n¹²⁸ U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n¹²⁹ U.N. Charter art. 42.\n¹³⁰ U.N. Charter art. 51.\n190 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nbut is short of an armed attack; or third, as conduct which equates to an armed attack.\"¹³¹ There is general consensus among legal and military scholars that, for a cyber attack to be considered an armed attack, the consequences of the conduct must be equivalent to the results of a traditional kinetic attack—typically death, destruction, or injury. According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.”¹³² This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.”¹³³ Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack.¹³⁴ Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”¹³⁵\nThe true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach.¹³⁶ Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force.¹³⁷ Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.”¹³⁸ In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force.¹³⁹ These criteria are:\n(1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\nCyber 3.0 191\n(3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate.\n(4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target’s borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have.¹⁴⁰ For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.¹⁴¹\nWhat limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack.¹⁴² Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51. Second, states must not deploy active\n¹⁴⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 91.\n¹⁴¹ *Id.* at 92.\n¹⁴² U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 42, 51.\n192 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ndefenses or cyber counterstrikes that violate the laws of war. It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems.¹⁴³ This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states.¹⁴⁴ Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.¹⁴⁵\nBefore a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders.¹⁴⁶ The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks.¹⁴⁸ Regardless, however, of what level\n¹⁴³ Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n¹⁴⁴ Hollis, supra note 46.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.”¹⁴⁹ It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.”¹⁵⁰ For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.”¹⁵¹ Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach:\nOur strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.¹⁵²\nWhile deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources . . . nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.”¹⁵³ In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace.¹⁵⁵ The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers.¹⁵⁶ One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.”¹⁵⁷ Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”¹⁵⁸\nWhile development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a\n¹⁵⁴ Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”¹⁶⁰\nOne such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks.¹⁶¹ What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework\nIt is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery)\n¹⁵⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n¹⁶⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n¹⁶¹ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E. Graham, *supra* note 79, at 92.\n196 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ninto the protocols.\"¹⁶² Despite these architectural conundrums, attribution remains an important part of the national response framework.\nWhile attribution and response are not warranted for every level of cyber incursion (to do so would be ineffective and inefficient) such concepts should be utilized for cyber attacks that pose significant threat or cause significant harm. Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.¹⁶³\nOn June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.”¹⁶⁴ The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?”¹⁶⁵ Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed:¹⁶⁶ These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation. The first and most prevalent\n¹⁶² Rosenzweig, *supra* note 75 at 31.\n¹⁶³ Katherine Stephens, *Cyberspace National Policy Considerations*, NATIONAL SECURITY CYBERSPACE INSTITUTE (Nov. 16, 2010), available at http://www.nsci-va.org/WhitePapers.htm.\n¹⁶⁴ Andrew Morse &amp; Ian Sherr, *Senate Website Gets Hacked*, WALL ST.

Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.”¹⁶⁸ For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive.¹⁶⁹ This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically.¹⁷⁰ Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks.¹⁷¹ An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.”¹⁷² For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.¹⁷³\nFinally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks.¹⁷⁴ For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory. While outside of the scope of this article, these problems of attribution can be resolved\n¹⁶⁷ *Id.* at 2.\n¹⁶⁸ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 77-78.\n¹⁶⁹ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2.\n¹⁷⁰ Robert Lemos, *NSA Attempting to Design Crack-Proof Computer*, ZDNET News (1 Feb 2001), available at http://www.zdnet.com/news/nsa-attempting-to-design-crack-proof-computer/114035; see also Oliver Rist, *Hack Tales: Air-gap Networking for the Price of a Pair of Sneakers*, Infoworld (29 May 2006), available at http://www.infoworld.com/d/networking/hack-tales-air-gap-networking-price-pair-sneakers-610.\n¹⁷¹ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 97.\n¹⁷² *Id.*\n¹⁷³ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2-3.\n¹⁷⁴ *Id.* at 3.\n198 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nby a more robust and secure acquisition process coupled with traditional criminal investigative techniques. For a visual depiction of the attribution problem refer to (Figure 1: “The Attribution Problem”).[175]\n(Figure 1: The \"Attribution Problem\")\nCyber 3.0 199\nAttribution on the Internet can be broken down into three distinct technological and practical levels. The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack.¹⁷⁶ This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack.¹⁷⁷ It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.¹⁷⁸\nUnderstanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin.¹⁷⁹ However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations.¹⁸⁰ Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated.¹⁸¹ According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations,\nAs with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks. Moreover, the resources, planning, and timeline for such attacks would provide many opportunities to identify and disrupt such attacks.¹⁸²\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nThis attack capability, however, will not remain static, as more and more actors will develop ever more sophisticated attack capabilities. The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance.¹⁸³ In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence.¹⁸⁴ Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁸⁵ Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code.¹⁸⁶ This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.”¹⁸⁷ In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity. This capability is in large part due to the architecture of the Internet and its transmission protocols.¹⁸⁸ A cyber attacker can launch a\n¹⁸³ *Id.*\n¹⁸⁴ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n¹⁸⁵ *Id.*\n¹⁸⁶ *Id.* at 33-34.\n¹⁸⁷ *Id.* at 37.\n¹⁸⁸ “Attributing an attack to a particular source or set of sources requires understanding what can happen to the packets used to perpetuate the attack as they traverse the network. The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W. Timothy Strayer et al., *An Integrated Architecture for Attack Attribution*, BNN TECHNOLOGIES 1 (Dec. 31 2003), available at http://www.ir.bbn.com/documents/techreports/TR8384.ps.\nCyber 3.0 201\nnew attack from the safety of an anonymous computer system from thousands of miles away with devastating effect. This combination of anonymity and distance makes attack via the Internet a lucrative and low-risk environment to conduct cyber operations.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous on the Internet during an attack is to obfuscate the original source of the attack by routing the attack through neutral or innocent intermediaries creating a “multi-stage” or “extended-connection” attack.¹⁸⁹ These intermediaries who constitute a multi-state attack are typically called “stepping stones” as demonstrated below in Figure 2.¹⁹⁰\n(Figure 2: Multi-stage Attack)\nSophisticated multi-stage attacks do not lend themselves to attribution and remain a substantial obstacle to the ability to respond directly against an attacker and impart any sort of deterrent effect. Despite these difficulties, attribution at the identity level is necessary to respond to, rather than merely defend against, cyber attacks.¹⁹¹ The continued evolution of the threat environment not only mandates that we ensure the resilience and defense of critical defense systems, but it also means the nation must continue to develop functional attribution technologies, policies, and strategies to deal with this challenge. According to Knake,\nAs the relevant technologies continue to evolve, it is important that the difficulty in carrying out significant attacks also increases. Our critical industries, military, and government agencies must\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ncontinue to raise their defense levels in order to keep the ability to cause destruction in the hands of a limited number of state actors.¹⁹²\nOther key elements in determining what technical level of attribution is required in any given situation are the concepts of *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁹³\n*Timing/Immediacy.* The timing/immediacy of a threat also influences what level of technical attribution is required. Timing can be broken down into four categories:¹⁹⁴ (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor.¹⁹⁵ Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker.¹⁹⁶ “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.”¹⁹⁷ This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology.¹⁹⁸ In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role.¹⁹⁹ When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists.²⁰⁰ Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks.²⁰¹ This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.²⁰²\n*Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction. Being able to distinguish between\n¹⁹² Knake, *supra* note 166, at 5.\n¹⁹³ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n¹⁹⁴ *Id.* at 34-35.\n¹⁹⁵ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 67.\n¹⁹⁶ *Id.* at 69.\n¹⁹⁷ *Id.*\n¹⁹⁸ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 34.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.* at 35.\n²⁰⁰ *Id.* at 39.\n²⁰¹ *Id.* at 25.\n²⁰² *Id.* at 35.\nCyber 3.0 203\nattacks on critical infrastructure versus espionage versus criminal misconduct, drives what technical level of attribution is required and sophistication of the response. “There are various sorts of deterrence that might be imagined; these have different implications for the needed quality and precision of the attribution. Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.”²⁰³ For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.²⁰⁴\n*Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”²⁰⁵\nA framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.”²⁰⁶ The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes,\n&gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely\n²⁰³ *Id.*\n²⁰⁴ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n²⁰⁵ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n²⁰⁶ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n204 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nto long dominate US security in cyberspace. But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.²⁰⁷\nWhile attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors.²⁰⁸ Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers.²⁰⁹ Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain.²¹⁰ Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWe must prepare. We must recognize the interconnectedness of cyber. And we must be mindful of the many ways cyberspace is used—as a peaceful instrument of\n²⁰⁷ *Id.* at 77.\n²⁰⁸ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, Section 934, at 4 (Nov. 2011).*\n²⁰⁹ *Id.*\n²¹⁰ Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 40. As Huntley notes, “The continued application of a law of armed conflict paradigm to modern conflict, one which is fundamentally different than that by which it was formed, will not only fail to protect the national security of the United States, but will also fail to protect the very interests it was designed to protect.”\nCyber 3.0 205\nglobal communications, as a tool of economic growth—and also as an instrument to threaten and sometimes cause harm. Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.²¹¹\nDeveloping a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.²¹²\nThere remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.”²¹³ Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect.²¹⁴ A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.”²¹⁵ In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now. One thing is for certain, reliance on cyberspace will not lessen, nor will the complexities of defending the nation’s freedom to operate in this dynamic domain.\n²¹¹ Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n²¹² THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 6.\n²¹³ LARRY GREENEMEIER, THE FOG OF CYBERWAR: WHAT ARE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (2011).\n²¹⁴ Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n²¹⁵ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 1.\n206 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68",

INTRODUCTION\nFirst I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.\n—Carl von Clausewitz\nZero-Day: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before. A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code. A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign. By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4 (May 2011), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR (April 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nStuxnet was designed not to steal information; rather it was designed to infiltrate Iranian industrial control systems (ICS), closed systems, specifically those that controlled nuclear centrifuges and take control. Once inside the operating system, Stuxnet had the ability to cause nuclear centrifuges to spin out of control by altering their rotational speed and causing the speed to fluctuate wildly. Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications. Experts warned:\n[T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage . . . . The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.\nThe advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace. He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers.

In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.” Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”\nThe danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth. These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities. Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful. It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful. To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment. Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease. Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence. Skilled attackers can hold military or national security systems at risk, but their activities can\n Arthur K.

The integration of U.S. military and civilian networks complicates defense efforts for U.S. military planners. U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the .mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure. As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes:\nThis near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.\nCyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks. Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work . . . from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”\nSecuring the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”). Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial. Cyber 3.0 proposes to make U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more robust, resilient, and redundant, thereby denying the benefit of\n Lynn, *supra* note 13.\n Lynn, *supra* note 10.\n Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks*, 88 TEX.

The strategy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities and acknowledges the growing cyber threat environment: “The Department and nation have vulnerabilities in cyberspace. Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”\nCyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace. The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain. As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains. The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs. The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks. Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks. Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.\nWhile the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues.

Hence, this article proposes that the U.S. pursue a sixth initiative as part of its cyber strategy—develop a framework of attribution capabilities.\nAfter discussing the five strategic initiatives, the current state of international law and the law of war in the context of the cyber domain, this article will explore the capabilities and technical limitations of attribution. Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n## II. THE FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF CYBER 3.0\n### A. The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential\nThe approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.\n#### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”\nThe importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as:\n Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H. Comm. on Armed Services*, 112th Cong. 4, (2011) (Statement of Dr. James N. Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy) (hereinafter *2012 Budget Request*), available at http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/hearings?ContentRecord_id=79ce7b4c-f88b-40bf-9540-efdb3a2d26b2.\nCyber 3.0 173\n[A] man-made domain, and is therefore unlike the natural domains of air, land, and maritime. It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.\nBy treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.” In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”\nWhile understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined\nThere has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*. Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself. That is, it should\n\nrecognize the means and manner in which networks communicate, not simply provide a description of the physical infrastructure and architecture.\nThis article offers a definition that builds on the concept of the behavior of the domain and how its distinct architecture makes it unique amongst the war-fighting domains. Cyberspace is:\nAn operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.\nThis definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n## 3. Internet Architecture\nA rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.\nAt its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world. The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services. By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and\nCyber 3.0 175\nservices on top of a variety of networking technologies. The Internet employs a packet-switched network as part of its fundamental architecture. Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices. Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction. Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”\nWhat was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”\nThe Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer). Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n*Physical Layer*. According to Lawrence Lessig, “The Internet is a communication system. It consists of three layers. At the bottom, the physical layer, are wires and computers, and wires linking computers.” The physical layer\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Duncan B. Hollis, *An e-SoS for Cyberspace*, 52 HARV. INT’L L.J. 374, 397 (2011).\n *Id.*\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n Bernard Benhamou, *Organizing Internet Architecture, ESPRIT 2* (May 2006), available at www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/0705-BENHAMOU-EN-2.pdf.\n Lawrence Lessig, Lecture given at the inaugural Meredith and Kip Frey Lecture in Intellectual Property at Duke University School of Law, 181 (Mar. 23, 2001), available at www.law.duke.edu/pd/papers/lessig.pdf.\n\nof the Internet comprises its hardware, its infrastructure—from the fiber wires, which transmit signals in bursts of light, to routers and the power grid. This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function. While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.” The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.” With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs. This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace\nThe emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event. One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains. This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as\n LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6 (Nov 2008), available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n Colonel Michael S. Simpson, *Cyber Domain Evolving in Concept, But Stymied by Slow Implementation*, U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE 2 (2010).\nCyber 3.0 177\na vector for attack—and much of the general public’s view of cyberspace as a benign daily companion.\nAccording to Dr. Daniel Kuehl, “In a very real sense cyberspace is a designed environment, created with the very specific intent of facilitating the use and exploitation of information, human interaction and intercommunication.” Dr. Martin Libicki, Senior Management Scientist of the RAND Corporation states,\nCyberspace is a thing of contrasts: It is a space and is thus similar to such other media of contention as the land and sea. It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct . . .\nSome commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated:\nThe United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.\nChanging the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nAny understanding of the cyber domain must account for its dynamic design, behavior, and the many technologies which constitute it. Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain\nBased on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n## B. The Second Strategic Initiative: Employ New Defense Operating Concepts to Protect DOD Networks and Systems\nProtecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and other attacks.66\nCyber 3.0 179\nIn cyberspace, the only “absolute” defense is an unrealistic one: that is, to unplug from networks completely, step out of the matrix, thereby forfeiting the innumerable benefits the cyber domain offers. Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic. Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design. Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks. Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic. Cyberspace is an offense dominant environment and therefore active defenses are required to address emerging security concerns.\nThe DOD’s new cyber operating concepts are based on performing four “steps”:\n(1) Enhancing cyber hygiene best practices to improve its cyber security;\n(2) Detering and mitigating insider threats, strengthening workforce communications, workforce accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities;\n(3) Developing new defense operating concepts and computing architectures;\n As the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, General Alexander noted, “There no longer remains the option to unplug from cyberspace as the information it provides has become the lifeblood of our society.” U.S. Cyber Command: Organizing For Cyberspace Operations: Hearing Before H. Comm. on Armed Services, 111th Cong. H.A.S.C. No. 111-179 (2010) (statement of General Keith B.

Kesan &amp; Carol M. Hayes, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence In Cyberspace*, HARV. J.L. &amp; TECH., 33 (forthcoming), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1805163.\n Id.\n Active defenses are electronic countermeasures designed to strike attacking computer systems and shut down cyber attacks midstream. They work by placing scanning technology at the interface of military networks and the open Internet to detect and stop malicious code before it passes into military networks. Active defenses now protect all defense and intelligence networks in the “.mil domain.” For the most part active defenses are classified though programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine have entered the public domain. See JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE: MAPPING THE CYBER UNDERWORLD 46 (2010). See also Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Skelrov, *Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent*, 201 MIL. L. REV 1, 2 (2009) (discussing active defenses).\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 6.\n\n(4) Employing an active cyber defense capability to prevent intrusions onto networks and systems.\nTo better understand the concept of active defense, it is essential to understand the limitations of passive defense commonly and derisively described as “patch &amp; pray.” Passive defense methods such as firewalls, patches, and antivirus software offer measures of security that often fall short as they cannot keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of cyber threats. General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75\nSo it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of\nCyber 3.0 181\nthree distinct phases: intrusion detection, traceback, and counterstrike capabilities.77 IP traceback is a technical/forensic method of tracking an IP packet across the internet, permitting a victim of an attack to follow digital bread crumbs back to the initial attacker. Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the .mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter . . . active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81\nThe development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over .mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n\nC. The Third Strategic Initiative: Partner with Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies and the Private Sector to Enable a Whole-of-Government Cybersecurity Strategy\nA robust, defensible infrastructure will depend on shaping the technologies employed, the obligations of operators of key networks and infrastructures, and the ability to coordinate government-private sector investment and response to attacks.^[84]^\nThe cyber domain poses asymmetric and evolving threats to both the military and private sectors. According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^[85]^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the .mil, .gov and .com domains.^[86]^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^[87]^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^[88]^\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the .com and .gov domains while the DOD secures the .mil domain.^[89]^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^[90]^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be\nCyber 3.0 183\ndone in terms of cooperation and collaboration. A collaborative industry-government framework must be put in place where private sector strengths (such as innovation and new technologies) are also drawn upon during times of attack.\nTraditionally, government responses to cyber threats depend on where the threat originates and the sector that is being targeted. These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated,\n&gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.\nGovernment agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated. Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.\nThe question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.” How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties? While outside the scope of this article, developing complete answers to these questions are at the forefront of policymaking concerns.\n\nD. The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity*\n*Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*\nCyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world. According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.” Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”\nBuilding a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.” By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed. Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\nDistributed systems require distributed action. This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world. Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies. In addition to providing better tracking capabilities of\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 21.\n *Id.* at 3.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n Miller, *supra* note 34, at 7.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 9.\n *Id.* at 7.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 11.\n *Id.*\nCyber 3.0 185\nthreats, collective defenses may also be employed to create a cyber threat early warning system which will allow member states to alert one another to cross-border cyber threats. Some commentators have recommended that a duty to assist (akin to a maritime SOS) be created to foster a more immediate and directed response to cyber attacks. Despite the many benefits of international collaboration, collective defenses or the possibility of an international duty to assist, responding to a cyber attack still requires some level of attribution.\nE. The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation\nThe nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.\nThe United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.” The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat. According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.” The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander:\nPurely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.\nNot only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses\n *Id.* at 13.\n Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n *Id.* at 104-107.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n\non developing a streamlined acquisition process to keep pace with the racing life cycle of technological development. “It currently takes the Department of Defense approximately eighty-one months to make new computing systems operational. This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”\nA cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace . . . we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.” The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.” From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained. Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED)\nTo exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor. This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.\nThe five strategic initiatives of Cyber 3.0 make clear that cyberspace is the emerging threat environment of the 21st century. Its five initiatives lend much\n\n Id. at 10.\n Rattray, supra note 84, at 274.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 11.\n Darren C.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki,\nDeterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.\nA narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation. This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy, deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.” He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.” Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”\nDeterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense . . . We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable\n W.W.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.\nUnfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”\nAttribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.” To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?” Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”\nThe traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66, (Spring 2011), available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action . . . as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.” Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force\n U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n U.N. Charter art. 42.\n U.N. Charter art. 51.\n\nbut is short of an armed attack; or third, as conduct which equates to an armed attack.\" There is general consensus among legal and military scholars that, for a cyber attack to be considered an armed attack, the consequences of the conduct must be equivalent to the results of a traditional kinetic attack—typically death, destruction, or injury. According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.” This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.” Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack. Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”\nThe true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force. Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.” In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force. These criteria are:\n(1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\nCyber 3.0 191\n(3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate.\n(4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target’s borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have. For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.\nWhat limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack. Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51. Second, states must not deploy active\n Graham, *supra* note 79, at 91.\n *Id.* at 92.\n U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 42, 51.\n\ndefenses or cyber counterstrikes that violate the laws of war. It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems. This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states. Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.\nBefore a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders. The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks. Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks. Regardless, however, of what level\n Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n Hollis, supra note 46. See also Lieutenant Colonel Joshua E.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.” It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.” For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.” Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach:\nOur strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.\nWhile deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources . . . nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.” In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace. The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers. One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.” Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”\nWhile development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a\n Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

According to David E. Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”\nOne such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks. What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework\nIt is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery)\n Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E. Graham, *supra* note 79, at 92.\n\ninto the protocols.\" Despite these architectural conundrums, attribution remains an important part of the national response framework.\nWhile attribution and response are not warranted for every level of cyber incursion (to do so would be ineffective and inefficient) such concepts should be utilized for cyber attacks that pose significant threat or cause significant harm. Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.\nOn June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.” The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?” Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed: These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation. The first and most prevalent\n Rosenzweig, *supra* note 75 at 31.\n Katherine Stephens, *Cyberspace National Policy Considerations*, NATIONAL SECURITY CYBERSPACE INSTITUTE (Nov. 16, 2010), available at http://www.nsci-va.org/WhitePapers.htm.\n Andrew Morse &amp; Ian Sherr, *Senate Website Gets Hacked*, WALL ST.

A traceback approach, where the attack sequence is traced to its source, is typically applied to such situations. Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.” For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive. This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically. Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks. An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.” For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.\nFinally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks. For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory. While outside of the scope of this article, these problems of attribution can be resolved\n *Id.* at 2.\n Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 77-78.\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2.\n Robert Lemos, *NSA Attempting to Design Crack-Proof Computer*, ZDNET News (1 Feb 2001), available at http://www.zdnet.com/news/nsa-attempting-to-design-crack-proof-computer/114035; see also Oliver Rist, *Hack Tales: Air-gap Networking for the Price of a Pair of Sneakers*, Infoworld (29 May 2006), available at http://www.infoworld.com/d/networking/hack-tales-air-gap-networking-price-pair-sneakers-610.\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 97.\n *Id.*\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2-3.\n *Id.* at 3.\n\nby a more robust and secure acquisition process coupled with traditional criminal investigative techniques. For a visual depiction of the attribution problem refer to (Figure 1: “The Attribution Problem”).[175]\n(Figure 1: The \"Attribution Problem\")\nCyber 3.0 199\nAttribution on the Internet can be broken down into three distinct technological and practical levels. The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack. This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack. It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.\nUnderstanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin. However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations. Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated. According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations,\nAs with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks. Moreover, the resources, planning, and timeline for such attacks would provide many opportunities to identify and disrupt such attacks.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nThis attack capability, however, will not remain static, as more and more actors will develop ever more sophisticated attack capabilities. The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance. In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence. Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*. Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code. This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.” In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity. This capability is in large part due to the architecture of the Internet and its transmission protocols. A cyber attacker can launch a\n *Id.*\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 33-34.\n *Id.* at 37.\n “Attributing an attack to a particular source or set of sources requires understanding what can happen to the packets used to perpetuate the attack as they traverse the network. The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W. Timothy Strayer et al., *An Integrated Architecture for Attack Attribution*, BNN TECHNOLOGIES 1 (Dec. 31 2003), available at http://www.ir.bbn.com/documents/techreports/TR8384.ps.\nCyber 3.0 201\nnew attack from the safety of an anonymous computer system from thousands of miles away with devastating effect. This combination of anonymity and distance makes attack via the Internet a lucrative and low-risk environment to conduct cyber operations.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous on the Internet during an attack is to obfuscate the original source of the attack by routing the attack through neutral or innocent intermediaries creating a “multi-stage” or “extended-connection” attack. These intermediaries who constitute a multi-state attack are typically called “stepping stones” as demonstrated below in Figure 2.\n(Figure 2: Multi-stage Attack)\nSophisticated multi-stage attacks do not lend themselves to attribution and remain a substantial obstacle to the ability to respond directly against an attacker and impart any sort of deterrent effect. Despite these difficulties, attribution at the identity level is necessary to respond to, rather than merely defend against, cyber attacks. The continued evolution of the threat environment not only mandates that we ensure the resilience and defense of critical defense systems, but it also means the nation must continue to develop functional attribution technologies, policies, and strategies to deal with this challenge. According to Knake,\nAs the relevant technologies continue to evolve, it is important that the difficulty in carrying out significant attacks also increases. Our critical industries, military, and government agencies must\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ncontinue to raise their defense levels in order to keep the ability to cause destruction in the hands of a limited number of state actors.\nOther key elements in determining what technical level of attribution is required in any given situation are the concepts of *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.\n*Timing/Immediacy.* The timing/immediacy of a threat also influences what level of technical attribution is required. Timing can be broken down into four categories: (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor. Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker. “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.” This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology. In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role. When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists. Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks. This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.\n*Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction. Being able to distinguish between\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 5.\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n *Id.* at 34-35.\n Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 67.\n *Id.* at 69.\n *Id.*\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 34.\n *Id.* at 35.\n *Id.* at 39.\n *Id.* at 25.\n *Id.* at 35.\nCyber 3.0 203\nattacks on critical infrastructure versus espionage versus criminal misconduct, drives what technical level of attribution is required and sophistication of the response. “There are various sorts of deterrence that might be imagined; these have different implications for the needed quality and precision of the attribution. Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.” For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.\n*Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”\nA framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.” The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes,\n&gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely\n *Id.*\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n\nto long dominate US security in cyberspace. But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.\nWhile attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors. Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers. Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain. Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWe must prepare. We must recognize the interconnectedness of cyber.

As Huntley notes, “The continued application of a law of armed conflict paradigm to modern conflict, one which is fundamentally different than that by which it was formed, will not only fail to protect the national security of the United States, but will also fail to protect the very interests it was designed to protect.”\nCyber 3.0 205\nglobal communications, as a tool of economic growth—and also as an instrument to threaten and sometimes cause harm. Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.\nDeveloping a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.\nThere remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.” Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect. A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.” In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now. One thing is for certain, reliance on cyberspace will not lessen, nor will the complexities of defending the nation’s freedom to operate in this dynamic domain.\n Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 6.\n LARRY GREENEMEIER, THE FOG OF CYBERWAR: WHAT ARE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (2011).\n Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 1.",

INTRODUCTION\nFirst I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.\n—Carl von Clausewitz\nZero-Day: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before. A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code. A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign. By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4 (May 2011), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR (April 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nStuxnet was designed not to steal information; rather it was designed to infiltrate Iranian industrial control systems (ICS), closed systems, specifically those that controlled nuclear centrifuges and take control. Once inside the operating system, Stuxnet had the ability to cause nuclear centrifuges to spin out of control by altering their rotational speed and causing the speed to fluctuate wildly. Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications. Experts warned:\n[T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage . . . . The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.\nThe advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace. He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers.

In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.” Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”\nThe danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth. These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities. Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful. It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful. To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment. Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease. Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence.

The integration of U.S. military and civilian networks complicates defense efforts for U.S. military planners. U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the .mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure. As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes:\nThis near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.\nCyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks. Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work . . . from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”\nSecuring the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”). Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial. Cyber 3.0 proposes to make U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more robust, resilient, and redundant, thereby denying the benefit of\n Lynn, *supra* note 13.\n Lynn, *supra* note 10.\n Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks*, 88 TEX.

The strategy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities and acknowledges the growing cyber threat environment: “The Department and nation have vulnerabilities in cyberspace. Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”\nCyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace. The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain. As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains. The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs. The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks. Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks. Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.\nWhile the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues.

Hence, this article proposes that the U.S. pursue a sixth initiative as part of its cyber strategy—develop a framework of attribution capabilities.\nAfter discussing the five strategic initiatives, the current state of international law and the law of war in the context of the cyber domain, this article will explore the capabilities and technical limitations of attribution. Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n## II. THE FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF CYBER 3.0\n### A. The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential\nThe approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.\n#### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”\nThe importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as:\n Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H. Comm. on Armed Services*, 112th Cong. 4, (2011) (Statement of Dr. James N. Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy) (hereinafter *2012 Budget Request*), available at http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/hearings?ContentRecord_id=79ce7b4c-f88b-40bf-9540-efdb3a2d26b2.\nCyber 3.0 173\n[A] man-made domain, and is therefore unlike the natural domains of air, land, and maritime. It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.\nBy treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.” In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”\nWhile understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined\nThere has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*. Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself. That is, it should\n\nrecognize the means and manner in which networks communicate, not simply provide a description of the physical infrastructure and architecture.\nThis article offers a definition that builds on the concept of the behavior of the domain and how its distinct architecture makes it unique amongst the war-fighting domains. Cyberspace is:\nAn operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.\nThis definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n## 3. Internet Architecture\nA rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.\nAt its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world. The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services. By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and\nCyber 3.0 175\nservices on top of a variety of networking technologies. The Internet employs a packet-switched network as part of its fundamental architecture. Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices. Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction. Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”\nWhat was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”\nThe Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer). Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n*Physical Layer*. According to Lawrence Lessig, “The Internet is a communication system. It consists of three layers. At the bottom, the physical layer, are wires and computers, and wires linking computers.” The physical layer\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Duncan B. Hollis, *An e-SoS for Cyberspace*, 52 HARV.

This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function. While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.” The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.” With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs. This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace\nThe emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event. One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains. This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as\n LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6 (Nov 2008), available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n Colonel Michael S.

It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct . . .\nSome commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated:\nThe United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.\nChanging the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nAny understanding of the cyber domain must account for its dynamic design, behavior, and the many technologies which constitute it. Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain\nBased on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n## B. The Second Strategic Initiative: Employ New Defense Operating Concepts to Protect DOD Networks and Systems\nProtecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and other attacks.66\nCyber 3.0 179\nIn cyberspace, the only “absolute” defense is an unrealistic one: that is, to unplug from networks completely, step out of the matrix, thereby forfeiting the innumerable benefits the cyber domain offers. Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic. Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design. Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks. Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic. Cyberspace is an offense dominant environment and therefore active defenses are required to address emerging security concerns.\nThe DOD’s new cyber operating concepts are based on performing four “steps”:\n(1) Enhancing cyber hygiene best practices to improve its cyber security;\n(2) Detering and mitigating insider threats, strengthening workforce communications, workforce accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities;\n(3) Developing new defense operating concepts and computing architectures;\n As the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, General Alexander noted, “There no longer remains the option to unplug from cyberspace as the information it provides has become the lifeblood of our society.” U.S. Cyber Command: Organizing For Cyberspace Operations: Hearing Before H. Comm. on Armed Services, 111th Cong. H.A.S.C. No. 111-179 (2010) (statement of General Keith B.

J.L. &amp; TECH., 33 (forthcoming), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1805163.\n Id.\n Active defenses are electronic countermeasures designed to strike attacking computer systems and shut down cyber attacks midstream. They work by placing scanning technology at the interface of military networks and the open Internet to detect and stop malicious code before it passes into military networks. Active defenses now protect all defense and intelligence networks in the “.mil domain.” For the most part active defenses are classified though programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine have entered the public domain. See JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE: MAPPING THE CYBER UNDERWORLD 46 (2010). See also Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Skelrov, *Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent*, 201 MIL. L. REV 1, 2 (2009) (discussing active defenses).\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 6.\n\n(4) Employing an active cyber defense capability to prevent intrusions onto networks and systems.\nTo better understand the concept of active defense, it is essential to understand the limitations of passive defense commonly and derisively described as “patch &amp; pray.” Passive defense methods such as firewalls, patches, and antivirus software offer measures of security that often fall short as they cannot keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of cyber threats. General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75\nSo it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of\nCyber 3.0 181\nthree distinct phases: intrusion detection, traceback, and counterstrike capabilities.77 IP traceback is a technical/forensic method of tracking an IP packet across the internet, permitting a victim of an attack to follow digital bread crumbs back to the initial attacker. Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the .mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter . . . active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81\nThe development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over .mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n\nC. The Third Strategic Initiative: Partner with Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies and the Private Sector to Enable a Whole-of-Government Cybersecurity Strategy\nA robust, defensible infrastructure will depend on shaping the technologies employed, the obligations of operators of key networks and infrastructures, and the ability to coordinate government-private sector investment and response to attacks.^[84]^\nThe cyber domain poses asymmetric and evolving threats to both the military and private sectors. According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^[85]^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the .mil, .gov and .com domains.^[86]^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^[87]^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^[88]^\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the .com and .gov domains while the DOD secures the .mil domain.^[89]^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^[90]^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be\nCyber 3.0 183\ndone in terms of cooperation and collaboration. A collaborative industry-government framework must be put in place where private sector strengths (such as innovation and new technologies) are also drawn upon during times of attack.\nTraditionally, government responses to cyber threats depend on where the threat originates and the sector that is being targeted. These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated,\n&gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.\nGovernment agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated. Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.\nThe question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.” How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties? While outside the scope of this article, developing complete answers to these questions are at the forefront of policymaking concerns.\n\nD. The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity*\n*Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*\nCyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world. According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.” Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”\nBuilding a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.” By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed. Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\nDistributed systems require distributed action. This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world. Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies. In addition to providing better tracking capabilities of\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 21.\n *Id.* at 3.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n Miller, *supra* note 34, at 7.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 9.\n *Id.* at 7.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 11.\n *Id.*\nCyber 3.0 185\nthreats, collective defenses may also be employed to create a cyber threat early warning system which will allow member states to alert one another to cross-border cyber threats. Some commentators have recommended that a duty to assist (akin to a maritime SOS) be created to foster a more immediate and directed response to cyber attacks. Despite the many benefits of international collaboration, collective defenses or the possibility of an international duty to assist, responding to a cyber attack still requires some level of attribution.\nE. The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation\nThe nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.\nThe United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.” The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat. According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.” The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander:\nPurely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.\nNot only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses\n *Id.* at 13.\n Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n *Id.* at 104-107.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n\non developing a streamlined acquisition process to keep pace with the racing life cycle of technological development. “It currently takes the Department of Defense approximately eighty-one months to make new computing systems operational. This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”\nA cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace . . . we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.” The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.” From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained. Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED)\nTo exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor. This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.\nThe five strategic initiatives of Cyber 3.0 make clear that cyberspace is the emerging threat environment of the 21st century. Its five initiatives lend much\n\n Id. at 10.\n Rattray, supra note 84, at 274.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 11.\n Darren C.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki,\nDeterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.\nA narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation. This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy, deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.” He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.” Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”\nDeterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense . . . We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable\n W.W.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.\nUnfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”\nAttribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.” To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?” Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”\nThe traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66, (Spring 2011), available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action . . . as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.” Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force\n U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n U.N. Charter art. 42.\n U.N. Charter art. 51.\n\nbut is short of an armed attack; or third, as conduct which equates to an armed attack.\" There is general consensus among legal and military scholars that, for a cyber attack to be considered an armed attack, the consequences of the conduct must be equivalent to the results of a traditional kinetic attack—typically death, destruction, or injury. According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.” This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.” Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack. Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”\nThe true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force. Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.” In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force. These criteria are:\n(1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\nCyber 3.0 191\n(3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate.\n(4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target’s borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have. For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.\nWhat limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack. Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51. Second, states must not deploy active\n Graham, *supra* note 79, at 91.\n *Id.* at 92.\n U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 42, 51.\n\ndefenses or cyber counterstrikes that violate the laws of war. It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems. This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states. Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.\nBefore a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders. The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks. Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks. Regardless, however, of what level\n Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n Hollis, supra note 46. See also Lieutenant Colonel Joshua E.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.” It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.” For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.” Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach:\nOur strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.\nWhile deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources . . . nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.” In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace. The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers. One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.” Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”\nWhile development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a\n Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

According to David E. Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”\nOne such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks. What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework\nIt is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery)\n Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E. Graham, *supra* note 79, at 92.\n\ninto the protocols.\" Despite these architectural conundrums, attribution remains an important part of the national response framework.\nWhile attribution and response are not warranted for every level of cyber incursion (to do so would be ineffective and inefficient) such concepts should be utilized for cyber attacks that pose significant threat or cause significant harm. Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.\nOn June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.” The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?” Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed: These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation. The first and most prevalent\n Rosenzweig, *supra* note 75 at 31.\n Katherine Stephens, *Cyberspace National Policy Considerations*, NATIONAL SECURITY CYBERSPACE INSTITUTE (Nov. 16, 2010), available at http://www.nsci-va.org/WhitePapers.htm.\n Andrew Morse &amp; Ian Sherr, *Senate Website Gets Hacked*, WALL ST. J., June 14, 2011, available at http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303848104576383970053018848.html.\n *Id.*\n *Untangling Attribution: Moving to Accountability In Cyberspace, Hearing on Planning for the Future of Cyber Attack Before the Subcomm. on Technology and Innovation of the Comm. on Science &amp; Technology*, 111th Cong. 2 (2010) (statement of Robert K. Knake, International Affairs Fellow in Residence, the Council on Foreign Relations), available at http://www.cfr.org/united-states/untangling-attribution-moving-accountability-cyberspace/p22630.\nCyber 3.0 197\nattribution problem deals with tracing attacks carried out over the Internet and its associated networks. A traceback approach, where the attack sequence is traced to its source, is typically applied to such situations. Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.” For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive. This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically. Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks. An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.” For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.\nFinally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks. For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory. While outside of the scope of this article, these problems of attribution can be resolved\n *Id.* at 2.\n Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 77-78.\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2.\n Robert Lemos, *NSA Attempting to Design Crack-Proof Computer*, ZDNET News (1 Feb 2001), available at http://www.zdnet.com/news/nsa-attempting-to-design-crack-proof-computer/114035; see also Oliver Rist, *Hack Tales: Air-gap Networking for the Price of a Pair of Sneakers*, Infoworld (29 May 2006), available at http://www.infoworld.com/d/networking/hack-tales-air-gap-networking-price-pair-sneakers-610.\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 97.\n *Id.*\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2-3.\n *Id.* at 3.\n\nby a more robust and secure acquisition process coupled with traditional criminal investigative techniques. For a visual depiction of the attribution problem refer to (Figure 1: “The Attribution Problem”).[175]\n(Figure 1: The \"Attribution Problem\")\nCyber 3.0 199\nAttribution on the Internet can be broken down into three distinct technological and practical levels. The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack. This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack. It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.\nUnderstanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin. However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations. Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated. According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations,\nAs with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks. Moreover, the resources, planning, and timeline for such attacks would provide many opportunities to identify and disrupt such attacks.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nThis attack capability, however, will not remain static, as more and more actors will develop ever more sophisticated attack capabilities. The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance. In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence. Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*. Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code. This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.” In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity. This capability is in large part due to the architecture of the Internet and its transmission protocols. A cyber attacker can launch a\n *Id.*\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 33-34.\n *Id.* at 37.\n “Attributing an attack to a particular source or set of sources requires understanding what can happen to the packets used to perpetuate the attack as they traverse the network. The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W. Timothy Strayer et al., *An Integrated Architecture for Attack Attribution*, BNN TECHNOLOGIES 1 (Dec. 31 2003), available at http://www.ir.bbn.com/documents/techreports/TR8384.ps.\nCyber 3.0 201\nnew attack from the safety of an anonymous computer system from thousands of miles away with devastating effect. This combination of anonymity and distance makes attack via the Internet a lucrative and low-risk environment to conduct cyber operations.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous on the Internet during an attack is to obfuscate the original source of the attack by routing the attack through neutral or innocent intermediaries creating a “multi-stage” or “extended-connection” attack. These intermediaries who constitute a multi-state attack are typically called “stepping stones” as demonstrated below in Figure 2.\n(Figure 2: Multi-stage Attack)\nSophisticated multi-stage attacks do not lend themselves to attribution and remain a substantial obstacle to the ability to respond directly against an attacker and impart any sort of deterrent effect. Despite these difficulties, attribution at the identity level is necessary to respond to, rather than merely defend against, cyber attacks. The continued evolution of the threat environment not only mandates that we ensure the resilience and defense of critical defense systems, but it also means the nation must continue to develop functional attribution technologies, policies, and strategies to deal with this challenge. According to Knake,\nAs the relevant technologies continue to evolve, it is important that the difficulty in carrying out significant attacks also increases. Our critical industries, military, and government agencies must\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ncontinue to raise their defense levels in order to keep the ability to cause destruction in the hands of a limited number of state actors.\nOther key elements in determining what technical level of attribution is required in any given situation are the concepts of *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.\n*Timing/Immediacy.* The timing/immediacy of a threat also influences what level of technical attribution is required. Timing can be broken down into four categories: (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor. Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker. “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.” This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology. In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role. When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists. Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks. This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.\n*Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction. Being able to distinguish between\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 5.\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n *Id.* at 34-35.\n Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 67.\n *Id.* at 69.\n *Id.*\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 34.\n *Id.* at 35.\n *Id.* at 39.\n *Id.* at 25.\n *Id.* at 35.\nCyber 3.0 203\nattacks on critical infrastructure versus espionage versus criminal misconduct, drives what technical level of attribution is required and sophistication of the response. “There are various sorts of deterrence that might be imagined; these have different implications for the needed quality and precision of the attribution. Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.” For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.\n*Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”\nA framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.” The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes,\n&gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely\n *Id.*\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n\nto long dominate US security in cyberspace. But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.\nWhile attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors. Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers. Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain. Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWe must prepare. We must recognize the interconnectedness of cyber. And we must be mindful of the many ways cyberspace is used—as a peaceful instrument of\n *Id.* at 77.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, Section 934, at 4 (Nov. 2011).*\n *Id.*\n Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 40. As Huntley notes, “The continued application of a law of armed conflict paradigm to modern conflict, one which is fundamentally different than that by which it was formed, will not only fail to protect the national security of the United States, but will also fail to protect the very interests it was designed to protect.”\nCyber 3.0 205\nglobal communications, as a tool of economic growth—and also as an instrument to threaten and sometimes cause harm. Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.\nDeveloping a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.\nThere remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.” Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect. A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.” In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now. One thing is for certain, reliance on cyberspace will not lessen, nor will the complexities of defending the nation’s freedom to operate in this dynamic domain.\n Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 6.\n LARRY GREENEMEIER, THE FOG OF CYBERWAR: WHAT ARE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (2011).\n Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 1.",

By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.",

We can either work together to realize their potential for greater prosperity and security or we can succumb to narrow interests and undue fears that limit progress. Cybersecurity is not an end unto itself; it is instead an obligation that our governments and societies must take on willingly, to ensure that innovation continues to flourish, drive markets and improve lives.\n—President Barack Obama\n## I. INTRODUCTION\nFirst I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.\n—Carl von Clausewitz\nZero-Day: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before. A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code. A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign. By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4 (May 2011), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR (April 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n Id.\n Id.\n\nStuxnet was designed not to steal information; rather it was designed to infiltrate Iranian industrial control systems (ICS), closed systems, specifically those that controlled nuclear centrifuges and take control. Once inside the operating system, Stuxnet had the ability to cause nuclear centrifuges to spin out of control by altering their rotational speed and causing the speed to fluctuate wildly. Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications. Experts warned:\n[T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage . . . . The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.\nThe advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace. He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers.

In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.” Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”\nThe danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth. These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities. Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful. It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful. To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment. Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease. Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence. Skilled attackers can hold military or national security systems at risk, but their activities can\n Arthur K.

The integration of U.S. military and civilian networks complicates defense efforts for U.S. military planners. U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the .mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure. As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes:\nThis near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.\nCyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks. Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work . . . from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”\nSecuring the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”). Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial. Cyber 3.0 proposes to make U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more robust, resilient, and redundant, thereby denying the benefit of\n Lynn, *supra* note 13.\n Lynn, *supra* note 10.\n Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks*, 88 TEX. L. REV. 1533 (2010).\n This article adopts and modifies Dr. Daniel Kuehl’s definition of cyberspace, defining it “as an operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks.” This definition largely draws from the definition presented by Daniel T. Kuehl in his article *From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem*, in *CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY* 28 (2009).\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 99.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STRATEGY FOR OPERATING IN CYBERSPACE* 1 (July 2011), available at http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2011/0411_cyberstrategy/docs/DOD_Strategy_for_Operating_in_Cyberspace_July_2011.pdf.\nCyber 3.0 171\nattack. The strategy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities and acknowledges the growing cyber threat environment: “The Department and nation have vulnerabilities in cyberspace. Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”\nCyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace. The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain. As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains. The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs. The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks. Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks. Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.\nWhile the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues. The absence of an attribution\n Id.\n Id. at 5.\n Lynn, supra note 14, at 101.\n Id.\n Id. at 103.\n As Deputy Secretary Lynn noted, “The best-laid defenses on military networks will matter little unless our civilian critical infrastructure is also able to withstand attacks.” Id. at 104.\n Id. at 104-105.\n Id. at 105-106.\n\ncapability in Cyber 3.0 is the document’s central weakness. Hence, this article proposes that the U.S. pursue a sixth initiative as part of its cyber strategy—develop a framework of attribution capabilities.\nAfter discussing the five strategic initiatives, the current state of international law and the law of war in the context of the cyber domain, this article will explore the capabilities and technical limitations of attribution. Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n## II.

The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential\nThe approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.\n#### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”\nThe importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as:\n Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H. Comm. on Armed Services*, 112th Cong. 4, (2011) (Statement of Dr. James N. Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy) (hereinafter *2012 Budget Request*), available at http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/hearings?ContentRecord_id=79ce7b4c-f88b-40bf-9540-efdb3a2d26b2.\nCyber 3.0 173\n[A] man-made domain, and is therefore unlike the natural domains of air, land, and maritime. It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.\nBy treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.” In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”\nWhile understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined\nThere has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*. Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.” This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself. That is, it should\n\nrecognize the means and manner in which networks communicate, not simply provide a description of the physical infrastructure and architecture.\nThis article offers a definition that builds on the concept of the behavior of the domain and how its distinct architecture makes it unique amongst the war-fighting domains. Cyberspace is:\nAn operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.\nThis definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n## 3. Internet Architecture\nA rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.\nAt its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world. The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services. By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and\nCyber 3.0 175\nservices on top of a variety of networking technologies. The Internet employs a packet-switched network as part of its fundamental architecture. Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices. Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction. Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”\nWhat was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”\nThe Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer). Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n*Physical Layer*. According to Lawrence Lessig, “The Internet is a communication system. It consists of three layers. At the bottom, the physical layer, are wires and computers, and wires linking computers.” The physical layer\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Duncan B. Hollis, *An e-SoS for Cyberspace*, 52 HARV. INT’L L.J. 374, 397 (2011).\n *Id.*\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n Bernard Benhamou, *Organizing Internet Architecture, ESPRIT 2* (May 2006), available at www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/0705-BENHAMOU-EN-2.pdf.\n Lawrence Lessig, Lecture given at the inaugural Meredith and Kip Frey Lecture in Intellectual Property at Duke University School of Law, 181 (Mar. 23, 2001), available at www.law.duke.edu/pd/papers/lessig.pdf.\n\nof the Internet comprises its hardware, its infrastructure—from the fiber wires, which transmit signals in bursts of light, to routers and the power grid. This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function. While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.” The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.” With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs. This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace\nThe emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event. One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains. This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as\n LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n *Id.*\n *Id.*\n Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6 (Nov 2008), available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n Colonel Michael S. Simpson, *Cyber Domain Evolving in Concept, But Stymied by Slow Implementation*, U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE 2 (2010).\nCyber 3.0 177\na vector for attack—and much of the general public’s view of cyberspace as a benign daily companion.\nAccording to Dr. Daniel Kuehl, “In a very real sense cyberspace is a designed environment, created with the very specific intent of facilitating the use and exploitation of information, human interaction and intercommunication.” Dr. Martin Libicki, Senior Management Scientist of the RAND Corporation states,\nCyberspace is a thing of contrasts: It is a space and is thus similar to such other media of contention as the land and sea. It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct . . .\nSome commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated:\nThe United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.\nChanging the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nAny understanding of the cyber domain must account for its dynamic design, behavior, and the many technologies which constitute it. Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain\nBased on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n## B. The Second Strategic Initiative: Employ New Defense Operating Concepts to Protect DOD Networks and Systems\nProtecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and other attacks.66\nCyber 3.0 179\nIn cyberspace, the only “absolute” defense is an unrealistic one: that is, to unplug from networks completely, step out of the matrix, thereby forfeiting the innumerable benefits the cyber domain offers. Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic. Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design. Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks. Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic. Cyberspace is an offense dominant environment and therefore active defenses are required to address emerging security concerns.\nThe DOD’s new cyber operating concepts are based on performing four “steps”:\n(1) Enhancing cyber hygiene best practices to improve its cyber security;\n(2) Detering and mitigating insider threats, strengthening workforce communications, workforce accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities;\n(3) Developing new defense operating concepts and computing architectures;\n As the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, General Alexander noted, “There no longer remains the option to unplug from cyberspace as the information it provides has become the lifeblood of our society.” U.S. Cyber Command: Organizing For Cyberspace Operations: Hearing Before H. Comm. on Armed Services, 111th Cong. H.A.S.C. No. 111-179 (2010) (statement of General Keith B. Alexander, United States Army, Commander United States Cyber Command), available at http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0410_cybersec/docs/USCC%20Command%20Posture%20Statement_HASC_22SEP10_FINAL%20_OMB%20Approved_.pdf.\n Jay P. Kesan &amp; Carol M. Hayes, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence In Cyberspace*, HARV. J.L. &amp; TECH., 33 (forthcoming), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1805163.\n Id.\n Active defenses are electronic countermeasures designed to strike attacking computer systems and shut down cyber attacks midstream. They work by placing scanning technology at the interface of military networks and the open Internet to detect and stop malicious code before it passes into military networks. Active defenses now protect all defense and intelligence networks in the “.mil domain.” For the most part active defenses are classified though programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine have entered the public domain. See JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE: MAPPING THE CYBER UNDERWORLD 46 (2010). See also Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Skelrov, *Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent*, 201 MIL. L. REV 1, 2 (2009) (discussing active defenses).\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 6.\n\n(4) Employing an active cyber defense capability to prevent intrusions onto networks and systems.\nTo better understand the concept of active defense, it is essential to understand the limitations of passive defense commonly and derisively described as “patch &amp; pray.” Passive defense methods such as firewalls, patches, and antivirus software offer measures of security that often fall short as they cannot keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of cyber threats. General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75\nSo it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of\nCyber 3.0 181\nthree distinct phases: intrusion detection, traceback, and counterstrike capabilities.77 IP traceback is a technical/forensic method of tracking an IP packet across the internet, permitting a victim of an attack to follow digital bread crumbs back to the initial attacker. Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the .mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter . . . active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81\nThe development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over .mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n\nC. The Third Strategic Initiative: Partner with Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies and the Private Sector to Enable a Whole-of-Government Cybersecurity Strategy\nA robust, defensible infrastructure will depend on shaping the technologies employed, the obligations of operators of key networks and infrastructures, and the ability to coordinate government-private sector investment and response to attacks.^[84]^\nThe cyber domain poses asymmetric and evolving threats to both the military and private sectors. According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^[85]^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the .mil, .gov and .com domains.^[86]^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^[87]^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^[88]^\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the .com and .gov domains while the DOD secures the .mil domain.^[89]^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^[90]^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be\nCyber 3.0 183\ndone in terms of cooperation and collaboration. A collaborative industry-government framework must be put in place where private sector strengths (such as innovation and new technologies) are also drawn upon during times of attack.\nTraditionally, government responses to cyber threats depend on where the threat originates and the sector that is being targeted. These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated,\n&gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.\nGovernment agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated. Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.\nThe question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.” How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties? While outside the scope of this article, developing complete answers to these questions are at the forefront of policymaking concerns.\n\nD. The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity*\n*Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*\nCyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world. According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.” Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”\nBuilding a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.” By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed. Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\nDistributed systems require distributed action. This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world. Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies. In addition to providing better tracking capabilities of\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 21.\n *Id.* at 3.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n Miller, *supra* note 34, at 7.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 9.\n *Id.* at 7.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 11.\n *Id.*\nCyber 3.0 185\nthreats, collective defenses may also be employed to create a cyber threat early warning system which will allow member states to alert one another to cross-border cyber threats. Some commentators have recommended that a duty to assist (akin to a maritime SOS) be created to foster a more immediate and directed response to cyber attacks. Despite the many benefits of international collaboration, collective defenses or the possibility of an international duty to assist, responding to a cyber attack still requires some level of attribution.\nE. The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation\nThe nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.\nThe United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.” The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat. According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.” The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander:\nPurely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.\nNot only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses\n *Id.* at 13.\n Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n *Id.* at 104-107.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n\non developing a streamlined acquisition process to keep pace with the racing life cycle of technological development. “It currently takes the Department of Defense approximately eighty-one months to make new computing systems operational. This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”\nA cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace . . . we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.” The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.” From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained. Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED)\nTo exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor. This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.\nThe five strategic initiatives of Cyber 3.0 make clear that cyberspace is the emerging threat environment of the 21st century. Its five initiatives lend much\n\n Id. at 10.\n Rattray, supra note 84, at 274.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 11.\n Darren C.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki,\nDeterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.\nA narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation. This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy, deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.” He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.” Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”\nDeterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense . . . We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable\n W.W.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.\nUnfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”\nAttribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.” To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?” Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”\nThe traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66, (Spring 2011), available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.” Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action . . . as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.” Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force\n U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n U.N. Charter art. 42.\n U.N. Charter art. 51.\n\nbut is short of an armed attack; or third, as conduct which equates to an armed attack.\" There is general consensus among legal and military scholars that, for a cyber attack to be considered an armed attack, the consequences of the conduct must be equivalent to the results of a traditional kinetic attack—typically death, destruction, or injury. According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.” This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.” Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack. Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”\nThe true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach. Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force. Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.” In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force. These criteria are:\n(1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\nCyber 3.0 191\n(3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate.\n(4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target’s borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have. For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.\nWhat limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack. Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51. Second, states must not deploy active\n Graham, *supra* note 79, at 91.\n *Id.* at 92.\n U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 42, 51.\n\ndefenses or cyber counterstrikes that violate the laws of war. It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems. This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states. Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.\nBefore a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders. The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks. Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks. Regardless, however, of what level\n Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n Hollis, supra note 46. See also Lieutenant Colonel Joshua E.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.” It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.” For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.” Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach:\nOur strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.\nWhile deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources . . . nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.” In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace. The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers. One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.” Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”\nWhile development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a\n Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

According to David E. Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”\nOne such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks. What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework\nIt is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery)\n Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E. Graham, *supra* note 79, at 92.\n\ninto the protocols.\" Despite these architectural conundrums, attribution remains an important part of the national response framework.\nWhile attribution and response are not warranted for every level of cyber incursion (to do so would be ineffective and inefficient) such concepts should be utilized for cyber attacks that pose significant threat or cause significant harm. Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.\nOn June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.” The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?” Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed: These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation. The first and most prevalent\n Rosenzweig, *supra* note 75 at 31.\n Katherine Stephens, *Cyberspace National Policy Considerations*, NATIONAL SECURITY CYBERSPACE INSTITUTE (Nov. 16, 2010), available at http://www.nsci-va.org/WhitePapers.htm.\n Andrew Morse &amp; Ian Sherr, *Senate Website Gets Hacked*, WALL ST.

A traceback approach, where the attack sequence is traced to its source, is typically applied to such situations. Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.” For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive. This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically. Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks. An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.” For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.\nFinally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks. For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory. While outside of the scope of this article, these problems of attribution can be resolved\n *Id.* at 2.\n Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 77-78.\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2.\n Robert Lemos, *NSA Attempting to Design Crack-Proof Computer*, ZDNET News (1 Feb 2001), available at http://www.zdnet.com/news/nsa-attempting-to-design-crack-proof-computer/114035; see also Oliver Rist, *Hack Tales: Air-gap Networking for the Price of a Pair of Sneakers*, Infoworld (29 May 2006), available at http://www.infoworld.com/d/networking/hack-tales-air-gap-networking-price-pair-sneakers-610.\n Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 97.\n *Id.*\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2-3.\n *Id.* at 3.\n\nby a more robust and secure acquisition process coupled with traditional criminal investigative techniques. For a visual depiction of the attribution problem refer to (Figure 1: “The Attribution Problem”).[175]\n(Figure 1: The \"Attribution Problem\")\nCyber 3.0 199\nAttribution on the Internet can be broken down into three distinct technological and practical levels. The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack. This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack. It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.\nUnderstanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin. However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations. Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated. According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations,\nAs with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks. Moreover, the resources, planning, and timeline for such attacks would provide many opportunities to identify and disrupt such attacks.\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nThis attack capability, however, will not remain static, as more and more actors will develop ever more sophisticated attack capabilities. The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance. In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence. Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*. Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code. This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.” In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity. This capability is in large part due to the architecture of the Internet and its transmission protocols. A cyber attacker can launch a\n *Id.*\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n *Id.*\n *Id.* at 33-34.\n *Id.* at 37.\n “Attributing an attack to a particular source or set of sources requires understanding what can happen to the packets used to perpetuate the attack as they traverse the network. The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W. Timothy Strayer et al., *An Integrated Architecture for Attack Attribution*, BNN TECHNOLOGIES 1 (Dec. 31 2003), available at http://www.ir.bbn.com/documents/techreports/TR8384.ps.\nCyber 3.0 201\nnew attack from the safety of an anonymous computer system from thousands of miles away with devastating effect. This combination of anonymity and distance makes attack via the Internet a lucrative and low-risk environment to conduct cyber operations.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous on the Internet during an attack is to obfuscate the original source of the attack by routing the attack through neutral or innocent intermediaries creating a “multi-stage” or “extended-connection” attack. These intermediaries who constitute a multi-state attack are typically called “stepping stones” as demonstrated below in Figure 2.\n(Figure 2: Multi-stage Attack)\nSophisticated multi-stage attacks do not lend themselves to attribution and remain a substantial obstacle to the ability to respond directly against an attacker and impart any sort of deterrent effect. Despite these difficulties, attribution at the identity level is necessary to respond to, rather than merely defend against, cyber attacks. The continued evolution of the threat environment not only mandates that we ensure the resilience and defense of critical defense systems, but it also means the nation must continue to develop functional attribution technologies, policies, and strategies to deal with this challenge. According to Knake,\nAs the relevant technologies continue to evolve, it is important that the difficulty in carrying out significant attacks also increases. Our critical industries, military, and government agencies must\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ncontinue to raise their defense levels in order to keep the ability to cause destruction in the hands of a limited number of state actors.\nOther key elements in determining what technical level of attribution is required in any given situation are the concepts of *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.\n*Timing/Immediacy.* The timing/immediacy of a threat also influences what level of technical attribution is required. Timing can be broken down into four categories: (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor. Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker. “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.” This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology. In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role. When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists. Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks. This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.\n*Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction. Being able to distinguish between\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 5.\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n *Id.* at 34-35.\n Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 67.\n *Id.* at 69.\n *Id.*\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 34.\n *Id.* at 35.\n *Id.* at 39.\n *Id.* at 25.\n *Id.* at 35.\nCyber 3.0 203\nattacks on critical infrastructure versus espionage versus criminal misconduct, drives what technical level of attribution is required and sophistication of the response. “There are various sorts of deterrence that might be imagined; these have different implications for the needed quality and precision of the attribution. Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.” For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.\n*Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”\nA framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.” The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes,\n&gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely\n *Id.*\n Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n\nto long dominate US security in cyberspace. But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.\nWhile attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors. Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers. Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain. Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWe must prepare. We must recognize the interconnectedness of cyber. And we must be mindful of the many ways cyberspace is used—as a peaceful instrument of\n *Id.* at 77.\n *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, Section 934, at 4 (Nov. 2011).*\n *Id.*\n Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 40. As Huntley notes, “The continued application of a law of armed conflict paradigm to modern conflict, one which is fundamentally different than that by which it was formed, will not only fail to protect the national security of the United States, but will also fail to protect the very interests it was designed to protect.”\nCyber 3.0 205\nglobal communications, as a tool of economic growth—and also as an instrument to threaten and sometimes cause harm. Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.\nDeveloping a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.\nThere remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.” Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect. A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.” In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now. One thing is for certain, reliance on cyberspace will not lessen, nor will the complexities of defending the nation’s freedom to operate in this dynamic domain.\n Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 6.\n LARRY GREENEMEIER, THE FOG OF CYBERWAR: WHAT ARE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (2011).\n Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 1."

INTRODUCTION\nFirst I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.²\n—Carl von Clausewitz\nZero-Day³: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before.⁴ A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code.⁵ A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign.⁶ By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n¹ THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4 (May 2011), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n² CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n³ See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n⁴ See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR (April 2011), http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n⁵ Id.\n⁶ Id.\n168 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nStuxnet was designed not to steal information; rather it was designed to infiltrate Iranian industrial control systems (ICS), closed systems, specifically those that controlled nuclear centrifuges and take control.⁷ Once inside the operating system, Stuxnet had the ability to cause nuclear centrifuges to spin out of control by altering their rotational speed and causing the speed to fluctuate wildly. Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications.⁸ Experts warned:\n[T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage . . . . The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.⁹\nThe advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace.¹⁰ He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers. U.S.\n⁷ Nicolas Falliere et al., *W32.Stuxnet Dossier, Version 1.1*, SYMANTEC (October 2010), http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/w32_stuxnet_dossier.pdf.\n⁸ Hari Sreenivasan, *Hunting an Industrial-Strength Computer Virus Around the Globe*, PBS NEWSHOUR, (October 1, 2010), http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec10/computervirus_10-01.html.\n⁹ Paul K.

Lynn III, Deputy Sec’y of Def., Remarks on Cyber at the RSA Conference, (Feb. 15, 2011), http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1535.\nCyber 3.0 169\npolicymakers have not adequately addressed this emerging threat environment and adapting a strategic vision to it should be made a top priority.\nCrafting the ways and means to achieve the desired security end state, however, is complicated. In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.”¹¹ Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”¹²\nThe danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth.¹³ These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities.¹⁴ Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful.¹⁵ It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful.¹⁶ To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment.¹⁷ Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease.¹⁸ Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence.

U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the .mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure.²⁰ As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes:\nThis near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.²¹\nCyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks.²² Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work . . . from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”²³\nSecuring the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”).²⁴ Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial. Cyber 3.0 proposes to make U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more robust, resilient, and redundant, thereby denying the benefit of\n¹⁹ Lynn, *supra* note 13.\n²⁰ Lynn, *supra* note 10.\n²¹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks*, 88 TEX.

The strategy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities and acknowledges the growing cyber threat environment: “The Department and nation have vulnerabilities in cyberspace. Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”²⁵\nCyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace.²⁶ The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain.²⁷ As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains.²⁸ The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs.²⁹ The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks.³⁰ Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks.³¹ Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.³²\nWhile the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues.

Hence, this article proposes that the U.S. pursue a sixth initiative as part of its cyber strategy—develop a framework of attribution capabilities.\nAfter discussing the five strategic initiatives, the current state of international law and the law of war in the context of the cyber domain, this article will explore the capabilities and technical limitations of attribution. Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n## II. THE FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF CYBER 3.0\n### A. The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential\nThe approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.³³\n#### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”³⁴\nThe importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as:\n³³ Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n³⁴ *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H. Comm. on Armed Services*, 112th Cong. 4, (2011) (Statement of Dr. James N. Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy) (hereinafter *2012 Budget Request*), available at http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/hearings?ContentRecord_id=79ce7b4c-f88b-40bf-9540-efdb3a2d26b2.\nCyber 3.0 173\n[A] man-made domain, and is therefore unlike the natural domains of air, land, and maritime. It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.³⁵\nBy treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.”³⁶ In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”³⁷\nWhile understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined\nThere has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*.³⁸ Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”³⁹ This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself. That is, it should\n174 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nrecognize the means and manner in which networks communicate, not simply provide a description of the physical infrastructure and architecture.\nThis article offers a definition that builds on the concept of the behavior of the domain and how its distinct architecture makes it unique amongst the war-fighting domains. Cyberspace is:\nAn operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.⁴⁰\nThis definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n## 3. Internet Architecture\nA rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.⁴¹\nAt its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world.⁴² The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services.⁴³ By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and\nCyber 3.0 175\nservices on top of a variety of networking technologies.⁴⁴ The Internet employs a packet-switched network as part of its fundamental architecture. Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices.⁴⁵ Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction.⁴⁶ Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”⁴⁷\nWhat was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”⁴⁸\nThe Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer).⁴⁹ Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n*Physical Layer*. According to Lawrence Lessig, “The Internet is a communication system. It consists of three layers. At the bottom, the physical layer, are wires and computers, and wires linking computers.”⁵⁰ The physical layer\n⁴⁴ *Id.*\n⁴⁵ *Id.*\n⁴⁶ Duncan B. Hollis, *An e-SoS for Cyberspace*, 52 HARV.

This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function.⁵¹ While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”⁵²—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.”⁵³ The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.”⁵⁴ With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs.⁵⁵ This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace\nThe emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event.⁵⁶ One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains.⁵⁷ This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as\n⁵¹ LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n⁵² Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n⁵³ *Id.*\n⁵⁴ *Id.*\n⁵⁵ Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n⁵⁶ See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6 (Nov 2008), available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n⁵⁷ Colonel Michael S. Simpson, *Cyber Domain Evolving in Concept, But Stymied by Slow Implementation*, U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE 2 (2010).\nCyber 3.0 177\na vector for attack—and much of the general public’s view of cyberspace as a benign daily companion.⁵⁸\nAccording to Dr. Daniel Kuehl, “In a very real sense cyberspace is a designed environment, created with the very specific intent of facilitating the use and exploitation of information, human interaction and intercommunication.”⁵⁹ Dr. Martin Libicki, Senior Management Scientist of the RAND Corporation states,\nCyberspace is a thing of contrasts: It is a space and is thus similar to such other media of contention as the land and sea. It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct . . .⁶⁰\nSome commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated:\nThe United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.⁶¹\nChanging the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.⁶²\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nAny understanding of the cyber domain must account for its dynamic design, behavior, and the many technologies which constitute it. Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain\nBased on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n## B. The Second Strategic Initiative: Employ New Defense Operating Concepts to Protect DOD Networks and Systems\nProtecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and other attacks.66\nCyber 3.0 179\nIn cyberspace, the only “absolute” defense is an unrealistic one: that is, to unplug from networks completely, step out of the matrix, thereby forfeiting the innumerable benefits the cyber domain offers. Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic.⁶⁷ Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design.⁶⁸ Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks.⁶⁹ Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic. Cyberspace is an offense dominant environment and therefore active defenses are required to address emerging security concerns.⁷⁰\nThe DOD’s new cyber operating concepts are based on performing four “steps”:⁷¹\n(1) Enhancing cyber hygiene best practices to improve its cyber security;\n(2) Detering and mitigating insider threats, strengthening workforce communications, workforce accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities;\n(3) Developing new defense operating concepts and computing architectures;\n⁶⁷ As the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, General Alexander noted, “There no longer remains the option to unplug from cyberspace as the information it provides has become the lifeblood of our society.” U.S. Cyber Command: Organizing For Cyberspace Operations: Hearing Before H.

They work by placing scanning technology at the interface of military networks and the open Internet to detect and stop malicious code before it passes into military networks. Active defenses now protect all defense and intelligence networks in the “.mil domain.” For the most part active defenses are classified though programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine have entered the public domain. See JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE: MAPPING THE CYBER UNDERWORLD 46 (2010). See also Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Skelrov, *Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent*, 201 MIL. L. REV 1, 2 (2009) (discussing active defenses).\n⁷¹ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 6.\n180 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\n(4) Employing an active cyber defense capability to prevent intrusions onto networks and systems.\nTo better understand the concept of active defense, it is essential to understand the limitations of passive defense commonly and derisively described as “patch &amp; pray.” Passive defense methods such as firewalls, patches, and antivirus software offer measures of security that often fall short as they cannot keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of cyber threats. General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75\nSo it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of\nCyber 3.0 181\nthree distinct phases: intrusion detection, traceback, and counterstrike capabilities.77 IP traceback is a technical/forensic method of tracking an IP packet across the internet, permitting a victim of an attack to follow digital bread crumbs back to the initial attacker. Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the .mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter . . . active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81\nThe development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over .mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n182 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\n77 Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35.\n78 Id.\n79 David E.

The Third Strategic Initiative: Partner with Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies and the Private Sector to Enable a Whole-of-Government Cybersecurity Strategy\nA robust, defensible infrastructure will depend on shaping the technologies employed, the obligations of operators of key networks and infrastructures, and the ability to coordinate government-private sector investment and response to attacks.^^\nThe cyber domain poses asymmetric and evolving threats to both the military and private sectors. According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the .mil, .gov and .com domains.^^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^^\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the .com and .gov domains while the DOD secures the .mil domain.^^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be\nCyber 3.0 183\ndone in terms of cooperation and collaboration. A collaborative industry-government framework must be put in place where private sector strengths (such as innovation and new technologies) are also drawn upon during times of attack.⁹¹\nTraditionally, government responses to cyber threats depend on where the threat originates and the sector that is being targeted. These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated,\n&gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.⁹²\nGovernment agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated.⁹³ Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.⁹⁴\nThe question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.”⁹⁵ How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties? While outside the scope of this article, developing complete answers to these questions are at the forefront of policymaking concerns.\n184 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nD. The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity*\n*Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*⁹⁶\nCyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world.⁹⁷ According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.”⁹⁸ Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”⁹⁹\nBuilding a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.”¹⁰⁰ By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed.¹⁰¹ Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\nDistributed systems require distributed action.¹⁰² This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world.¹⁰³ Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies. In addition to providing better tracking capabilities of\n⁹⁶ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 21.\n⁹⁷ *Id.* at 3.\n⁹⁸ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n⁹⁹ Miller, *supra* note 34, at 7.\n¹⁰⁰ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 9.\n¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 7.\n¹⁰² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 11.\n¹⁰³ *Id.*\nCyber 3.0 185\nthreats, collective defenses may also be employed to create a cyber threat early warning system which will allow member states to alert one another to cross-border cyber threats.¹⁰⁴ Some commentators have recommended that a duty to assist (akin to a maritime SOS) be created to foster a more immediate and directed response to cyber attacks.¹⁰⁵ Despite the many benefits of international collaboration, collective defenses or the possibility of an international duty to assist, responding to a cyber attack still requires some level of attribution.\nE. The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation\nThe nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.¹⁰⁶\nThe United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.”¹⁰⁷ The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat.¹⁰⁸ According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.”¹⁰⁹ The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander:\nPurely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.¹¹⁰\nNot only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses\n¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at 13.\n¹⁰⁵ Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n¹⁰⁶ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n¹⁰⁷ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n¹⁰⁸ *Id.* at 104-107.\n¹⁰⁹ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n¹¹⁰ Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n186 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\non developing a streamlined acquisition process to keep pace with the racing life cycle of technological development. “It currently takes the Department of Defense approximately eighty-one months to make new computing systems operational. This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”¹¹¹\nA cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace . . . we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.”¹¹² The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.”¹¹³ From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained.¹¹⁴ Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED)\nTo exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor. This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.¹¹⁵\nThe five strategic initiatives of Cyber 3.0 make clear that cyberspace is the emerging threat environment of the 21st century. Its five initiatives lend much\n¹¹¹ 2012 Budget Request, supra note 34, at 9.\n¹¹² Id. at 10.\n¹¹³ Rattray, supra note 84, at 274.\n¹¹⁴ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 11.\n¹¹⁵ Darren C.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki,\nDeterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.¹¹⁶\nA narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation.¹¹⁷ This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy,¹¹⁸ deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.”¹¹⁹ He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.”¹²⁰ Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”¹²¹\nDeterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011:\nWhen warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense . . . We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable\n¹¹⁶ W.W.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.¹²³\nUnfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”¹²⁴\nAttribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁵ To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?”¹²⁶ Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”¹²⁷\nThe traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n¹²² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n¹²³ Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n¹²⁴ Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66, (Spring 2011), available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n¹²⁵ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n¹²⁶ General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War\nThe Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”¹²⁸ Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action . . . as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.”¹²⁹ Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”¹³⁰ Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force\n¹²⁸ U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n¹²⁹ U.N. Charter art. 42.\n¹³⁰ U.N. Charter art. 51.\n190 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nbut is short of an armed attack; or third, as conduct which equates to an armed attack.\"¹³¹ There is general consensus among legal and military scholars that, for a cyber attack to be considered an armed attack, the consequences of the conduct must be equivalent to the results of a traditional kinetic attack—typically death, destruction, or injury. According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.”¹³² This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.”¹³³ Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack.¹³⁴ Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”¹³⁵\nThe true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach.¹³⁶ Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force.¹³⁷ Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.”¹³⁸ In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force.¹³⁹ These criteria are:\n(1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\nCyber 3.0 191\n(3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate.\n(4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target’s borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have.¹⁴⁰ For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.¹⁴¹\nWhat limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack.¹⁴² Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51. Second, states must not deploy active\n¹⁴⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 91.\n¹⁴¹ *Id.* at 92.\n¹⁴² U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 42, 51.\n192 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ndefenses or cyber counterstrikes that violate the laws of war. It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems.¹⁴³ This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states.¹⁴⁴ Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.¹⁴⁵\nBefore a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders.¹⁴⁶ The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks.¹⁴⁸ Regardless, however, of what level\n¹⁴³ Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n¹⁴⁴ Hollis, supra note 46.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.”¹⁴⁹ It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.”¹⁵⁰ For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.”¹⁵¹ Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach:\nOur strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.¹⁵²\nWhile deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources . . . nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.”¹⁵³ In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace.¹⁵⁵ The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers.¹⁵⁶ One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.”¹⁵⁷ Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”¹⁵⁸\nWhile development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a\n¹⁵⁴ Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”¹⁶⁰\nOne such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks.¹⁶¹ What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework\nIt is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery)\n¹⁵⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n¹⁶⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n¹⁶¹ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E. Graham, *supra* note 79, at 92.\n196 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ninto the protocols.\"¹⁶² Despite these architectural conundrums, attribution remains an important part of the national response framework.\nWhile attribution and response are not warranted for every level of cyber incursion (to do so would be ineffective and inefficient) such concepts should be utilized for cyber attacks that pose significant threat or cause significant harm. Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.¹⁶³\nOn June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.”¹⁶⁴ The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?”¹⁶⁵ Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed:¹⁶⁶ These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation. The first and most prevalent\n¹⁶² Rosenzweig, *supra* note 75 at 31.\n¹⁶³ Katherine Stephens, *Cyberspace National Policy Considerations*, NATIONAL SECURITY CYBERSPACE INSTITUTE (Nov. 16, 2010), available at http://www.nsci-va.org/WhitePapers.htm.\n¹⁶⁴ Andrew Morse &amp; Ian Sherr, *Senate Website Gets Hacked*, WALL ST.

Knake, International Affairs Fellow in Residence, the Council on Foreign Relations), available at http://www.cfr.org/united-states/untangling-attribution-moving-accountability-cyberspace/p22630.\nCyber 3.0 197\nattribution problem deals with tracing attacks carried out over the Internet and its associated networks.¹⁶⁷ A traceback approach, where the attack sequence is traced to its source, is typically applied to such situations. Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.”¹⁶⁸ For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive.¹⁶⁹ This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically.¹⁷⁰ Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks.¹⁷¹ An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.”¹⁷² For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.¹⁷³\nFinally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks.¹⁷⁴ For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory. While outside of the scope of this article, these problems of attribution can be resolved\n¹⁶⁷ *Id.* at 2.\n¹⁶⁸ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 77-78.\n¹⁶⁹ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2.\n¹⁷⁰ Robert Lemos, *NSA Attempting to Design Crack-Proof Computer*, ZDNET News (1 Feb 2001), available at http://www.zdnet.com/news/nsa-attempting-to-design-crack-proof-computer/114035; see also Oliver Rist, *Hack Tales: Air-gap Networking for the Price of a Pair of Sneakers*, Infoworld (29 May 2006), available at http://www.infoworld.com/d/networking/hack-tales-air-gap-networking-price-pair-sneakers-610.\n¹⁷¹ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 97.\n¹⁷² *Id.*\n¹⁷³ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2-3.\n¹⁷⁴ *Id.* at 3.\n198 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nby a more robust and secure acquisition process coupled with traditional criminal investigative techniques. For a visual depiction of the attribution problem refer to (Figure 1: “The Attribution Problem”).\n(Figure 1: The \"Attribution Problem\")\nCyber 3.0 199\nAttribution on the Internet can be broken down into three distinct technological and practical levels. The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack.¹⁷⁶ This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack.¹⁷⁷ It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.¹⁷⁸\nUnderstanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin.¹⁷⁹ However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations.¹⁸⁰ Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated.¹⁸¹ According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations,\nAs with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks. Moreover, the resources, planning, and timeline for such attacks would provide many opportunities to identify and disrupt such attacks.¹⁸²\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nThis attack capability, however, will not remain static, as more and more actors will develop ever more sophisticated attack capabilities. The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance.¹⁸³ In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence.¹⁸⁴ Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁸⁵ Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code.¹⁸⁶ This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.”¹⁸⁷ In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity. This capability is in large part due to the architecture of the Internet and its transmission protocols.¹⁸⁸ A cyber attacker can launch a\n¹⁸³ *Id.*\n¹⁸⁴ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n¹⁸⁵ *Id.*\n¹⁸⁶ *Id.* at 33-34.\n¹⁸⁷ *Id.* at 37.\n¹⁸⁸ “Attributing an attack to a particular source or set of sources requires understanding what can happen to the packets used to perpetuate the attack as they traverse the network. The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W.

This combination of anonymity and distance makes attack via the Internet a lucrative and low-risk environment to conduct cyber operations.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous on the Internet during an attack is to obfuscate the original source of the attack by routing the attack through neutral or innocent intermediaries creating a “multi-stage” or “extended-connection” attack.¹⁸⁹ These intermediaries who constitute a multi-state attack are typically called “stepping stones” as demonstrated below in Figure 2.¹⁹⁰\n(Figure 2: Multi-stage Attack)\nSophisticated multi-stage attacks do not lend themselves to attribution and remain a substantial obstacle to the ability to respond directly against an attacker and impart any sort of deterrent effect. Despite these difficulties, attribution at the identity level is necessary to respond to, rather than merely defend against, cyber attacks.¹⁹¹ The continued evolution of the threat environment not only mandates that we ensure the resilience and defense of critical defense systems, but it also means the nation must continue to develop functional attribution technologies, policies, and strategies to deal with this challenge. According to Knake,\nAs the relevant technologies continue to evolve, it is important that the difficulty in carrying out significant attacks also increases. Our critical industries, military, and government agencies must\nThe Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\ncontinue to raise their defense levels in order to keep the ability to cause destruction in the hands of a limited number of state actors.¹⁹²\nOther key elements in determining what technical level of attribution is required in any given situation are the concepts of *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁹³\n*Timing/Immediacy.* The timing/immediacy of a threat also influences what level of technical attribution is required. Timing can be broken down into four categories:¹⁹⁴ (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor.¹⁹⁵ Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker.¹⁹⁶ “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.”¹⁹⁷ This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology.¹⁹⁸ In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role.¹⁹⁹ When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists.²⁰⁰ Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks.²⁰¹ This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.²⁰²\n*Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction. Being able to distinguish between\n¹⁹² Knake, *supra* note 166, at 5.\n¹⁹³ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n¹⁹⁴ *Id.* at 34-35.\n¹⁹⁵ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 67.\n¹⁹⁶ *Id.* at 69.\n¹⁹⁷ *Id.*\n¹⁹⁸ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 34.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.* at 35.\n²⁰⁰ *Id.* at 39.\n²⁰¹ *Id.* at 25.\n²⁰² *Id.* at 35.\nCyber 3.0 203\nattacks on critical infrastructure versus espionage versus criminal misconduct, drives what technical level of attribution is required and sophistication of the response. “There are various sorts of deterrence that might be imagined; these have different implications for the needed quality and precision of the attribution. Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.”²⁰³ For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.²⁰⁴\n*Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”²⁰⁵\nA framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.”²⁰⁶ The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes,\n&gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely\n²⁰³ *Id.*\n²⁰⁴ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n²⁰⁵ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n²⁰⁶ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n204 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68\nto long dominate US security in cyberspace. But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.²⁰⁷\nWhile attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors.²⁰⁸ Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers.²⁰⁹ Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain.²¹⁰ Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n## IV. CONCLUSION\nWe must prepare. We must recognize the interconnectedness of cyber. And we must be mindful of the many ways cyberspace is used—as a peaceful instrument of\n²⁰⁷ *Id.* at 77.\n²⁰⁸ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CYBERSPACE POLICY REPORT: A REPORT TO CONGRESS PURSUANT TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011, Section 934, at 4 (Nov. 2011).*\n²⁰⁹ *Id.*\n²¹⁰ Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 40. As Huntley notes, “The continued application of a law of armed conflict paradigm to modern conflict, one which is fundamentally different than that by which it was formed, will not only fail to protect the national security of the United States, but will also fail to protect the very interests it was designed to protect.”\nCyber 3.0 205\nglobal communications, as a tool of economic growth—and also as an instrument to threaten and sometimes cause harm. Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.²¹¹\nDeveloping a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.²¹²\nThere remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.”²¹³ Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect.²¹⁴ A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.”²¹⁵ In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now. One thing is for certain, reliance on cyberspace will not lessen, nor will the complexities of defending the nation’s freedom to operate in this dynamic domain.\n²¹¹ Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n²¹² THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 6.\n²¹³ LARRY GREENEMEIER, THE FOG OF CYBERWAR: WHAT ARE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (2011).\n²¹⁴ Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n²¹⁵ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 1.\n206 The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68"

We can either work together to realize their potential for greater prosperity and security or we can succumb to narrow interests and undue fears that limit progress. Cybersecurity is not an end unto itself; it is instead an obligation that our governments and societies must take on willingly, to ensure that innovation continues to flourish, drive markets and improve lives.¹ —President Barack Obama ## I. INTRODUCTION First I shall proceed from the simple to the complex. But in war more than in any other subject we must begin by looking at the nature of the whole; for here more than elsewhere the part and the whole must always be thought of together.² —Carl von Clausewitz Zero-Day³: June 17, 2010. Sergey Ulasen, the head of the Anti-virus department of VirusBlokAda, a small Belarus IT security firm, uncovered a particularly sophisticated computer worm, one the likes the world had never seen before.⁴ A computer worm is malicious software that can self-replicate and can spread itself over a network to cause harm or take control. This particular worm was elaborately designed to spread itself within an operating system and then lay dormant, waiting for a signal to strike. It spread via an infected USB flash drive inserted into a computer’s USB port. Once inserted, software on the infected drive covertly uploaded two files into the target computer: a rootkit dropper (which allows the worm to take control of an operating system, manipulating it) and an injector for delivering a “payload” of encrypted code.⁵ A “payload” is software code designed within the worm to deliver a specified effect—from deleting critical files, to taking control of a system or installing a backdoor into the network. The worm’s name was Stuxnet. Most troubling was the fact that, by design, the Stuxnet worm hid itself as soon as it compromised the host system by using a digital signature—a signature that legitimate programs utilize to demonstrate they are authorized and benign.⁶ By the time Stuxnet had been detected it had Iran’s nuclear infrastructure in its cross-hairs.\n¹ THE WHITE HOUSE, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR CYBERSPACE, PROSPERITY, SECURITY AND OPENNESS IN A NETWORKED WORLD 4, http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/internationalstrategy_cyberspace.pdf.\n² CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, ON WAR: THE COMPLETE EDITION (2009).\n³ See Tony Bradley, Zero Day Exploits: Holy Grail of the Malicious Hacker, ABOUT.COM (2010), http://netsecurity.about.com/od/newsandeditorial1/a/aazeroday.htm. According to Bradley, “The Holy Grail for malicious program and virus writers is the ‘zero day exploit.’ A zero day exploit is when the exploit for the vulnerability is created before, or on the same day as the vulnerability is learned about by the vendor. By creating a virus or worm that takes advantage of vulnerability the vendor is not yet aware of and for which there is not currently a patch available, the attacker can wreak maximum havoc.” Id.\n⁴ See Michael Joseph Gross, Stuxnet Worm: A Declaration of Cyber-War, VANITY FAIR, http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2011/04/stuxnet-201104.\n⁵ Id.\n⁶ Id.\n\nStuxnet was designed not to steal information; rather it was designed to infiltrate Iranian industrial control systems (ICS), closed systems, specifically those that controlled nuclear centrifuges and take control.⁷ Once inside the operating system, Stuxnet had the ability to cause nuclear centrifuges to spin out of control by altering their rotational speed and causing the speed to fluctuate wildly. Stuxnet also had the ability to introduce fake data into the system to make it appear that the centrifuges were operating normally, when in fact they were being destroyed from within. Stuxnet has been described by some as “the world’s first precision guided cyber-munition” and its creation has far-ranging strategic and security implications.⁸ Experts warned: [T]he emergence of the Stuxnet worm is the type of risk that threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society. The Stuxnet worm covertly attempts to identify and exploit equipment that controls a nation’s critical infrastructure. A successful attack by a software application such as the Stuxnet worm could result in manipulation of control system code to the point of inoperability or long-term damage.... The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.⁹ The advent of worms like Stuxnet has demonstrated that actors within the global digital environment possess the capability to “weaponize” software code. By doing this they can seize control of systems and disrupt their operations throughout the world, unconstrained by political and territorial borders. Nations, their militaries, and their economies are vulnerable to ever sophisticated cyber threats. Cyber threats manipulate, alter, degrade or destroy information systems. A cyber threat can manifest itself in many forms from an attack from a foreign nation to espionage to cyber crime and computer viruses. Malicious cyber activities pose a very real and immediate security threat to national security and commerce. Therefore, an appropriate strategic foundation to counter this emerging threat is needed.\nIn developing a strategy responsive to the threat, policymakers and military strategists alike have focused on the central characteristics of the growing cyber environment. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed the Pentagon’s new strategy for securing cyberspace.¹⁰ He noted that cyber warfare by design is akin to asymmetric warfare, even when prosecuted by superpowers.

Lynn III, Deputy Sec’y of Def., Remarks on Cyber at the RSA Conference, (Feb. 15, 2011), http://www.defense.gov/Speeches/Speech.aspx?SpeechID=1535.\nCyber 3.0 169 policymakers have not adequately addressed this emerging threat environment and adapting a strategic vision to it should be made a top priority.\nCrafting the ways and means to achieve the desired security end state, however, is complicated. In the asymmetric environment of cyberspace, there are no simple solutions and there are typically more questions than answers. The late Arthur Cebrowski, retired Admiral, U.S. Navy, and a pioneer in cyber analysis agreed with this assessment when he observed, “There is no technology, government policy, law, treaty or program that can stop the acceleration of competition in cyberspace.”¹¹ Low entry costs, evolving technological capabilities, and ease of attack make operation in the cyber domain a basic capability that can be easily achieved by adversaries. As noted by Deputy Secretary William J. Lynn, “Advances in technology have created a situation in which extremely robust capabilities can be developed at considerably low cost.”¹² The danger and potency of the threat is exacerbated by the very nature of the system one wants to protect. For example, Internet architecture was designed to be open, collaborative, and rapidly expandable to support ease of use, innovation, and continued growth.¹³ These built-in dynamics of design allowed for a reliable and efficient means to connect disparate networks into a single global system, a “network of networks.” In shaping the system, security and identity management considerations were, and continue to be, low priorities.¹⁴ Confronted with an open architecture, network defenders must guard against all that is thrown against them while aggressors need only discover one breach in the digital armor for their attack to be successful.¹⁵ It is an overwhelming task. It only takes a scant amount of coding for malware to be successful.¹⁶ To defend against malware, anti-virus companies write millions of lines of code, and spend millions of dollars in research, to detect and counteract malicious script. Malware can be written in as little as twenty-five lines and the result can easily remain viable in the digital environment.¹⁷ Another unique feature of cyberspace is that it defies traditional sovereign borders with relative ease.¹⁸ Geographic and political boundaries are of little consequence. Skilled attackers can hold military or national security systems at risk, but their activities can ¹¹ Arthur K.

U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) networks are largely reliant on networks outside of the.mil domain, to include national critical infrastructure.²⁰ As Professor Eric Talbot Jensen notes: This near-complete intermixing of civilian and military computer infrastructures makes many of those civilian objects and providers legitimate targets under the law of armed conflict. The current integration of U.S. government assets with civilian systems makes segregation impossible and therefore creates a responsibility for the United States to protect those civilian networks, services, and communications.²¹ Cyberspace is a domain where information is created, stored, modified, and exploited via interconnected networks.²² Since it is relatively easy to seize the initiative and launch an attack against an information system, one can consider cyberspace an opportunistic and offense-dominant environment. In an offense-dominant cyber threat environment, a purely defensive or “bunker mentality” cannot keep pace. Static defenses can always be circumvented by ingenuity, tenacity, and technology—common virtues possessed by most skilled cyber operators. Deputy Secretary Lynn recognized this fact, stating, “A fortress mentality will not work... from a defense point of view it is difficult to protect every portal. What is needed is a strategy to deny the benefit to the attackers who need only a single point of entry to disrupt our systems.”²³ Securing the nation’s critical infrastructure, its networks and servers, should be an essential consideration of an effective cyber strategy. In order to respond to cyber threats, the DOD developed and announced its first strategy that provides for operational flexibility and adaptability in cyberspace. Released on July 14, 2011, this cyber strategy is entitled “Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace” (hereinafter “Cyber 3.0”).²⁴ Its central focus is one of deterrence by denial. Cyber 3.0 proposes to make U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more robust, resilient, and redundant, thereby denying the benefit of ¹⁹ Lynn, *supra* note 13.\n²⁰ Lynn, *supra* note 10.\n²¹ Eric Talbot Jensen, *Cyber Warfare and Precautions Against the Effects of Attacks*, 88 TEX. L. REV. 1533 (2010).\n²² This article adopts and modifies Dr. Daniel Kuehl’s definition of cyberspace, defining it “as an operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks.” This definition largely draws from the definition presented by Daniel T. Kuehl in his article *From Cyberspace to Cyberpower: Defining the Problem*, in *CYBERPOWER AND NATIONAL SECURITY* 28 (2009).\n²³ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 99.\n²⁴ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE STRATEGY FOR OPERATING IN CYBERSPACE* 1, available at http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2011/0411_cyberstrategy/docs/DOD_Strategy_for_Operating_in_Cyberspace_July_2011.pdf.\nCyber 3.0 171 attack. The strategy aims to mitigate vulnerabilities and acknowledges the growing cyber threat environment: “The Department and nation have vulnerabilities in cyberspace. Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”²⁵ Cyber 3.0 proposes to employ five initiatives to secure cyberspace.²⁶ The first is noteworthy for its recognition of cyberspace as an emergent war-fighting domain.²⁷ As mankind has evolved using first land, then sea, air and space to conduct commerce and compete for resources, conflict has also developed in these domains. As the only man-made and largely privately owned domain, cyberspace is as critical to national security as the other more traditional domains.²⁸ The first initiative proposes that the military must now be able to defend, deter, and operate within this domain. The second initiative predictably relies on the military developing the ability to respond to cyber attacks as they occur and to employ active defenses before serious damage occurs.²⁹ The third initiative seeks to ensure that the nation’s civilian critical infrastructure is secured and is also able to withstand attacks.³⁰ Collective defense and deterrence is the fourth initiative. Due to the global and interconnected nature of the Internet, U.S. global allies can offer real-time assistance in detecting, deterring, and responding to attacks.³¹ Finally, the fifth initiative proposes to leverage the U.S. technological base, banking on the nation’s “geek capital,” to assist in the development of cyber defense technologies and training to defeat threats.³² While the introductions of the Cyber 3.0 strategic initiatives are a welcome development, they are incomplete. The strategy’s overarching thrust is denying the benefit of an attack rather than penalizing attackers. While Cyber 3.0 discusses the role of the traditional instruments of power, it fails to address the DOD’s own core competency—direct military action. Simply put, the cyber strategy fails to address the application and appropriate use of force in cyberspace. Therefore, more is needed. To complicate this endeavor, the challenge of successfully attributing the sources of an attack is time-consuming and difficult. The legal and technical requirement of identifying the perpetrator of a cyber attack (attribution) is not addressed in the proffered strategy.\nWhile Cyber 3.0 does much to build the nation’s resiliency and survivability from cyber threats, it falls short of providing an actionable framework for response. Attribution technologies and policy must be developed if the U.S. hopes to successfully deter and respond to such attacks. Attribution is a key legal, tactical, and technical requirement, and must be performed before a nation executes active self-defense activities. Attribution is an essential consideration as part of the legal analysis of “armed attack” and “use of force” issues.

Hence, this article proposes that the U.S. pursue a sixth initiative as part of its cyber strategy—develop a framework of attribution capabilities.\nAfter discussing the five strategic initiatives, the current state of international law and the law of war in the context of the cyber domain, this article will explore the capabilities and technical limitations of attribution. Finally, it will discuss how a framework of attribution can be leveraged to provide situational awareness during a cyber attack and assist in framing an appropriate and lawful response.\n## II. THE FIVE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF CYBER 3.0 ### A. The First Initiative: Treat Cyberspace as an Operational Domain to Organize, Train, and Equip so that the DOD Can Take Full Advantage of Cyberspace’s Potential The approaches we develop towards this domain will shape how it interacts with other domains and affects relationships among the other elements and instruments of power, especially how humans and organizations we create use that power. The march of technology and progress guarantees that even while we debate this definition—regardless of exactly how we define it now and refine it in the future—our use of cyberspace has already reached the point where an increasingly wide range of our social, political, economic and military activities are dependent on it and thus vulnerable to both interruption of its use and usurpation of its capabilities.³³ #### 1. Cyberspace is a Domain?\nTo begin an analysis of cyberspace, it is important to understand why labeling cyberspace a war-fighting domain is even necessary. Military strategists, policymakers, and innovators have long dealt with the challenges found in the traditional domains of land, air, and sea. The many historical failures and successes in the traditional domains have shaped understanding and strategic vision; doctrine and technologies were then adjusted and developed accordingly. A new and complex domain has arisen—cyberspace. It “presents security challenges that are too novel and too serious for it to be treated as an add-on to our traditional operations on land, at sea, or in the air.”³⁴ The importance of treating cyberspace as an operational domain cannot be overstated. The DOD recognizes cyberspace as a domain carried forward from the traditional domains for the purposes of organizing, training, and equipping its forces. Air Force Doctrine 3-12, *Cyber Operations* characterizes cyberspace as: ³³ Kuehl, *supra* note 22, at 24.\n³⁴ *2012 Budget Request From U.S. Cyber Command Before the Subcomm. on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the H. Comm. on Armed Services*, 112th Cong. 4, (2011) (Statement of Dr. James N. Miller, Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy) (hereinafter *2012 Budget Request*), available at http://armedservices.house.gov/index.cfm/hearings?ContentRecord_id=79ce7b4c-f88b-40bf-9540-efdb3a2d26b2.\nCyber 3.0 173 [A] man-made domain, and is therefore unlike the natural domains of air, land, and maritime. It requires continued attention from humans to persist and encompass the features of specificity, global scope, and emphasis on the electromagnetic spectrum. Cyberspace nodes physically reside in all domains. Activities in cyberspace can enable freedom of action for activities in the other domains, and activities in the other domains can create effects in and through cyberspace.³⁵ By treating cyberspace as a war-fighting domain, it establishes the necessary organizational foundation to operate in a degraded cyber environment by setting the stage for DOD to ready its cyber forces accordingly. Cyber 3.0 recognizes that “degraded cyberspace operations for extended periods may be a reality and disruption may occur in the midst of a mission.”³⁶ In the case of a contingency involving network failure or significant compromise, Cyber 3.0 requires the U.S. organize, train, and equip within the domain so that it is “able to remain operationally effective by isolating and neutralizing the impact, using redundant capacity, or shifting its operations from one system to another.”³⁷ While understanding why labeling cyberspace as an operational domain is important, it is also important to understand the underlying theory, architecture, and typology of cyberspace for a more complete strategic context.\n## 2. Cyberspace Defined There has been much academic debate on how to define cyberspace as it has evolved into a recognized war-fighting domain. The writer William Gibson originally coined the term “cyberspace” as a term of art in his science fiction novel *Neuromancer*.³⁸ Since that time, an understanding of the cyber domain has grown, and its definition has evolved. In 2008, the DOD changed its definition of cyberspace to the currently accepted version stating that cyberspace is a “global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, including the internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.”³⁹ This definition, however, omits a key element—the behavior of the domain itself. That is, it should recognize the means and manner in which networks communicate, not simply provide a description of the physical infrastructure and architecture.\nThis article offers a definition that builds on the concept of the behavior of the domain and how its distinct architecture makes it unique amongst the war-fighting domains. Cyberspace is: An operational domain located simultaneously at logical and physical layers whose unique architecture is framed by the use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to create, store, modify, exchange, and exploit information via interconnected networks which seamlessly intersect other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.⁴⁰ This definition not only accounts for the architecture of cyberspace as explained in a later section, but also accounts for the way cyberspace disregards traditional geographic and political boundaries. In addition, this definition recognizes the manner cyberspace intersects the traditional domains of land, sea, and air. Now that the domain of cyberspace has been defined, we move to the architecture and typology that make this domain unique.\n## 3. Internet Architecture A rudimentary understanding of the architecture and the characteristics of the cyber domain are necessary to begin to understand cyberspace’s many unique challenges. While the definition of cyberspace has been in state of flux, for the purpose of this article, cyberspace will be examined as if it were analogous to the Internet, a digital core sample of sorts. Certainly, the Internet is only a small part of the whole, as cyberspace encompasses much more than the Internet alone. Internet architecture serves only as a starting point for explaining the complexity of this emergent domain; so an analysis of the Internet should suffice here.⁴¹ At its most basic level, the Internet can be characterized as an agglomeration of individual computing devices that are networked to one another and to the outside world.⁴² The Internet is built out of many components that provide services, and these services are designed so that they can be combined in myriad forms to create ever more complex services.⁴³ By design the Internet is not meant to support one specific application but rather provides a universal platform for applications and Cyber 3.0 175 services on top of a variety of networking technologies.⁴⁴ The Internet employs a packet-switched network as part of its fundamental architecture. Understanding this packet-switched architecture is vital for further understanding of the foundational workings of the Internet.\nIn a packet-switched network, data transmitted across the Internet is broken into manageable bits called Internet Protocol, or “IP,”-packets. Each IP-packet contains the data being sent across the network, as well as information on the destination where the data is designated to arrive. Network routers forward these IP-packets so the packets move from router to router until arriving at the final destination. The IP-packets are then reconstituted by various applications upon arrival such as desktop computers or mobile devices.⁴⁵ Although IP-packets may originate from the same source, there are many distinct paths they may take to a destination. Each packet can take a random and unique path, which enables the packets to be routed around areas of the network not functioning properly. For example, IP-packets constituting an email take distinct paths through a network before being reconstituted for the end user. This practical design allows the Internet to be resilient and redundant in the face of sporadic outages or failure. This built-in resiliency was part of the original design goals of the Internet to ensure transmission of data regardless of network malfunction.⁴⁶ Indeed, in his article, *An E-SOS for Cyberspace*, Professor Duncan B. Hollis describes the Internet as “a network of networks, originally designed with one particular type of security in mind—to ensure communication in the face of an external attack on U.S. infrastructure.”⁴⁷ What was left out of the original design of the Internet was an underlying architecture for identity and attribution. The Internet was designed around the core concept of functionality and not based on a design for identification (attribution) and security. It was designed to be collaborative, rapidly expandable, and easily adaptable to technological innovation. “Information flow took precedence over content integrity; identify authentication was less important than connectivity.”⁴⁸ The Internet can also be viewed as having three fundamental and distinct layers linked first to data transport (the physical infrastructure), then to application function (the logical layer), and finally to information exchange (the content layer).⁴⁹ Each layer is dependent on the other layers to operate; however, each layer can be influenced and affected independently of the other layers.\n*Physical Layer*. According to Lawrence Lessig, “The Internet is a communication system. It consists of three layers. At the bottom, the physical layer, are wires and computers, and wires linking computers.”⁵⁰ The physical layer ⁴⁴ *Id.* ⁴⁵ *Id.* ⁴⁶ Duncan B. Hollis, *An e-SoS for Cyberspace*, 52 HARV. INT’L L.J. 374, 397 (2011).\n⁴⁷ *Id.* ⁴⁸ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n⁴⁹ Bernard Benhamou, *Organizing Internet Architecture, ESPRIT 2*, available at www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/0705-BENHAMOU-EN-2.pdf.\n⁵⁰ Lawrence Lessig, Lecture given at the inaugural Meredith and Kip Frey Lecture in Intellectual Property at Duke University School of Law, 181 (Mar. 23, 2001), available at www.law.duke.edu/pd/papers/lessig.pdf.\n\nof the Internet comprises its hardware, its infrastructure—from the fiber wires, which transmit signals in bursts of light, to routers and the power grid. This physical infrastructure can be subject to control or kinetic attack, destroying or disabling its capacity to function.⁵¹ While the physical layer is the only layer subject to kinetic attack, the other layers, are subject to intrusion, exploitation and control.\n*Logical Layer.* The Internet’s basic architecture is one of interchangeability and development. “On top of the physical layer is a logical layer”⁵²—the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that is the foundational language of the internet. TCP/IP ensures a separation of the transport functions and information processing functions. This active separation of packets is one of the basic principles of Internet architecture known as the “end-to-end principle.” “At the core of the Internet’s design is an ideal called end-to-end.”⁵³ The “end-to-end principle” means the intelligence (applications) resides at the periphery of the network and the network itself remains a mere conduit for IP protocol—as Lessig put it, “simple networks, smart applications.”⁵⁴ With an end-to-end design, innovation on the Internet doesn’t depend upon the evolution of the network itself. The network serves as a universal conduit for IP-packet transit while new content and applications can function whether or not the IP-packets are recognized by the network. The design of the Internet not only determines its functionality, what it is used for, but also determines how and where it can be compromised.\n*Content Layer.* Above the logical layer is a content layer. The content layer is perhaps the most recognizable layer of Internet architecture. The content layer consists of information/content streamed across the network and readily consumed by the end-user. This content can include emails, streaming video, web pages, MP3 files as well as applications (apps) and other programs.⁵⁵ This layer is also subject to intrusion, exploitation, and control.\n## 4. The Typology of Cyberspace The emergence of a new war-fighting domain is a rare event.⁵⁶ One of the most significant characteristics of the cyber domain is that it has developed without the luxury of time, theory, and pontification afforded to the other domains.⁵⁷ This characteristic, combined with cyberspace’s exponential growth, has created a gap between the operation of cyberspace and the policies and laws that are needed to regulate it. Not only does a gap exist between technology and policy, but one also exists between the manner in which defense experts view cyberspace—as ⁵¹ LIBICKI, *supra* note 42, at 12.\n⁵² Lessig, *supra* note 50, at 181.\n⁵³ *Id.* ⁵⁴ *Id.* ⁵⁵ Lawrence Lessig, *The Internet Under Siege*, FOREIGN POLICY 4 (1 Nov. 2001), available at http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2001/11/01/the_internet_under_siege.\n⁵⁶ See Rebecca Grant, *Rise of Cyber War*, A MITCHELL INSTITUTE SPECIAL REPORT 6, available at www.afa.org/mitchell/reports/1108cyberwar.pdf.\n⁵⁷ Colonel Michael S. Simpson, *Cyber Domain Evolving in Concept, But Stymied by Slow Implementation*, U.S. ARMY WAR COLLEGE 2 (2010).\nCyber 3.0 177 a vector for attack—and much of the general public’s view of cyberspace as a benign daily companion.⁵⁸ According to Dr. Daniel Kuehl, “In a very real sense cyberspace is a designed environment, created with the very specific intent of facilitating the use and exploitation of information, human interaction and intercommunication.”⁵⁹ Dr. Martin Libicki, Senior Management Scientist of the RAND Corporation states, Cyberspace is a thing of contrasts: It is a space and is thus similar to such other media of contention as the land and sea. It is also a space unlike any other, making it dissimilar. Cyberspace has to be appreciated on its own merits; it is a man-made construct...⁶⁰ Some commentators believe that reengineering the Internet to build in virtual boundaries and identity technologies is the most viable option to securing this domain. In February 2010, Vice Admiral Mike McConnell, former Director the National Security Agency, stated: The United States must also translate our intent into capabilities. We need to develop an early-warning system to monitor cyberspace, identify intrusions and locate the source of attacks with a trail of evidence that can support diplomatic, military and legal options—and we must be able to do this in milliseconds. More specifically, we need to reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence analysis and impact assessment—who did it, from where, why and what was the result—more manageable. The technologies are already available from public and private sources and can be further developed if we have the will to build them into our systems and to work with our allies and trading partners so they will do the same.⁶¹ Changing the architecture of the Internet, however, would most likely impact its continued innovation, capabilities and speed of growth—putting unnecessary constraints on an already flourishing environment of commerce and culture. Also, attempting to “fence-off” cyberspace through the creation of virtual/nationalistic boarders would be contrary to the current vision of an open and interoperable global cyber environment.⁶² The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68 Any understanding of the cyber domain must account for its dynamic design, behavior, and the many technologies which constitute it. Rapid innovation and evolution are the defining characteristics of cyberspace. In his Air War College paper, *A Cyberspace Command and Control Model*, Colonel Joseph Scherrer stated, “It is important to understand that the cyberspace infrastructure, like the information that flows through it, does not remain static. The technologies and architectural approaches that comprise cyberspace will continue to change over time, meaning that the fabric of cyberspace itself will evolve.”63 Cyberspace will continue to evolve in scope and importance. As stated in the Cyber 3.0 strategy, “Our reliance on cyberspace stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cyber security—the security of the technologies that we use each day.”64 Cyberspace will continue to develop at an astounding pace, to be a key enabler of our society, and to be awash in a sea of exploits and malicious actors. The architecture and protocols, which have made cyberspace and the Internet so prolific, are also the source of its greatest vulnerabilities.\n## 5. Implications of Cyberspace as a Domain Based on its design and functionality (with the Internet being a core sample of the larger domain) one can see that cyberspace does not exist in the same sense as other traditional domains where distinct boundaries can be defined. Cyberspace is amorphous, malleable, and constantly evolving. As one commentator put it, “Every system and every network can hold its own cyberspace—indeed it can hold limitless number of quasi-independent space. Cyberspace can appear in multiple, almost infinite, manifestations and forms.”65 Cyberspace has been fully integrated in all of the traditional domains and the ability to successfully function in them has become wholly dependent on it. A modern society and military cannot effectively operate without cyberspace. If cyber capabilities are denied, we could descend quickly from a digital-age to a dark-age in a matter of moments. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this and attempts to develop a framework based on the unique architecture and challenges presented by the domain.\n## B. The Second Strategic Initiative: Employ New Defense Operating Concepts to Protect DOD Networks and Systems Protecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and other attacks.66 Cyber 3.0 179 In cyberspace, the only “absolute” defense is an unrealistic one: that is, to unplug from networks completely, step out of the matrix, thereby forfeiting the innumerable benefits the cyber domain offers. Based on the widespread dependence on cyberspace, disconnecting or unplugging completely is unrealistic.⁶⁷ Passive defenses can be employed, but are largely ineffective. They consist of several categories: controls over system access, controls over data access, security administration, and secure system design.⁶⁸ Purely defensive measures concerning access include technologies such as firewalls, encryption, and virus detection. There are several central approaches for cyber security: learn about the threat, harden the target, and respond to the attacks.⁶⁹ Passive defenses only harden the target and rarely provide for an adequate mechanism for attack response. Cyber 3.0 recognizes this reality and requires implementation of defenses that are adaptable and dynamic. Cyberspace is an offense dominant environment and therefore active defenses are required to address emerging security concerns.⁷⁰ The DOD’s new cyber operating concepts are based on performing four “steps”:⁷¹ (1) Enhancing cyber hygiene best practices to improve its cyber security; (2) Detering and mitigating insider threats, strengthening workforce communications, workforce accountability, internal monitoring, and information management capabilities; (3) Developing new defense operating concepts and computing architectures; ⁶⁷ As the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, General Alexander noted, “There no longer remains the option to unplug from cyberspace as the information it provides has become the lifeblood of our society.” U.S. Cyber Command: Organizing For Cyberspace Operations: Hearing Before H.

They work by placing scanning technology at the interface of military networks and the open Internet to detect and stop malicious code before it passes into military networks. Active defenses now protect all defense and intelligence networks in the “.mil domain.” For the most part active defenses are classified though programs that send destructive viruses back to the perpetrator’s machine or packet-flood the intruder’s machine have entered the public domain. See JEFFREY CARR, INSIDE CYBER WARFARE: MAPPING THE CYBER UNDERWORLD 46 (2010). See also Lieutenant Commander Matthew J. Skelrov, *Solving the Dilemma of State Responses to Cyberattacks: A Justification for the Use of Active Defenses Against States Who Neglect Their Duty to Prevent*, 201 MIL. L. REV 1, 2 (2009) (discussing active defenses).\n⁷¹ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 6.\n\n(4) Employing an active cyber defense capability to prevent intrusions onto networks and systems.\nTo better understand the concept of active defense, it is essential to understand the limitations of passive defense commonly and derisively described as “patch &amp; pray.” Passive defense methods such as firewalls, patches, and antivirus software offer measures of security that often fall short as they cannot keep pace with the rapid development and deployment of cyber threats. General Alexander concurs in this assessment, arguing: “We can no longer depend on static defenses.”72 While passive defenses add resiliency to our networks, such defenses offer incomplete protection. Passive defenses alone are ineffectual at best, offering a false sense of security and complacency. Passive defenses lull the end user into thinking that as long as the software is kept up to date and patched, the threat is negated.\nSimilarly, according to Professors Jay Kesan and Carol Hayes, “Passive defense methods are not used consistently enough to have perfect deterrent effect and are all but useless against attacks utilizing zero-day exploits.”73 The U.S. must now rely on active defense technology to be able to actually respond to a cyber attack rather than merely absorb it. According to Deputy Secretary Lynn, “The United States cannot retreat behind a Maginot Line of firewalls or it will risk being overrun.”74 Active defense then becomes essential to detecting and eradicating threats on our nation’s networks. One commentator noted, “In short, the offense is stronger than the defense and that means that U.S. reliance on passive defenses is as doomed as the French were in 1940.”75 So it is now well established that a fundamental premise of conflict in cyberspace is that in an offense-dominant operational environment a “bunker mentality” does not work.76 This means static defenses, firewalls, and the engineered security of the network only go so far as no static defense in cyberspace is or ever will be infallible. This basic truism of cyberspace has been demonstrated time and time again. On a regular basis one reads about hackers penetrating firewalls and the passive defenses of private sector and government systems. Hackers exist to circumvent, undermine and breach static digital defenses. To a tenacious hacker, static defenses are viewed as nothing more than a new challenge—a problem to be solved, a trophy to be taken.\nGenerally, active defenses can be defined as countermeasures, which are employed to detect, neutralize, and mitigate cyber attacks. In their article, *Mitigative Counterstriking: Self-Defense and Deterrence in Cyberspace*, Kesan and Hayes proposed the concept that active defense begins at the detection state and consists of Cyber 3.0 181 three distinct phases: intrusion detection, traceback, and counterstrike capabilities.77 IP traceback is a technical/forensic method of tracking an IP packet across the internet, permitting a victim of an attack to follow digital bread crumbs back to the initial attacker. Counterstrike capabilities typically involve disrupting or disabling the attacker by sending countermeasures back to the source of the attack.78 Active defenses consist of electronic countermeasures that attack an aggressor computer system, disabling or immobilizing that system and thereby stopping the attack.79 This type of defense includes perimeter defense of the.mil domain as well as “intelligent” automated hunting on government networks searching for anomalies and security risks.80 Active defense technologies needed to engage in this fight are described by Deputy Secretary Lynn as, “Part sensor, part sentry, part sharpshooter... active defenses systems represent a fundamental shift in the U.S. approach to network defense.”81 The development and utilization of active defenses is vital to securing the nation’s military networks and in the near future, the nation’s commercial networks as well. It is important to note that the majority of government network traffic travels over commercial networks. “Many of DOD’s critical functions and operations rely on commercial assets, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and global supply chains, over, which DOD has no direct authority to mitigate risk.”82 With this in mind, active defenses deployed over.mil networks only protect a small fraction of government and critical networks. “As a corollary to the idea of active defenses (and to the conception that the cyber domain is pervasive) any policy needs to recognize that huge swaths of essential government activity involve communications via networks that are predominantly operated by the private sector.”83 Simply put, for active defenses to be effective, such defenses must be deployed on commercial networks in addition to government networks. This is a controversial proposition, as the private sector is concerned about further government intrusion, regulation and interference.\nClearly, the imposition and use of active defenses create numerous legal, technical, and political implications that need to be adequately addressed before wide-scale implementation. First among them is the issue of adequate attribution, which will be discussed at length in section III of this article.\n\nC. The Third Strategic Initiative: Partner with Other U.S. Government Departments and Agencies and the Private Sector to Enable a Whole-of-Government Cybersecurity Strategy A robust, defensible infrastructure will depend on shaping the technologies employed, the obligations of operators of key networks and infrastructures, and the ability to coordinate government-private sector investment and response to attacks.^[84]^ The cyber domain poses asymmetric and evolving threats to both the military and private sectors. According to Cyber 3.0, “The challenges of cyberspace cross sectors, industries, and U.S. government departments and agencies; they extend across national boundaries and through multiple components of the global economy.”^[85]^ To meet this asymmetric threat, the DOD created its third strategic initiative in an attempt to create a unified and collective approach to cyber security. Deputy Secretary Lynn contends that the DOD must develop a common operational picture, a shared intelligence process and establish collaborative bonds across the.mil,.gov and.com domains.^[86]^ This is easier said than done, since a large majority of the critical cyber infrastructure is in the hands of the private sector. The federal government, including the DOD, depends on this critical infrastructure to operate. Emphasizing this point, Mr. Riley Repko, a senior adviser in Cyber Operations and Transformation with the United States Air Force, observes: “The private sector influences the composition and operation of cyberspace more than it influences any other war-fighting domain. The military and federal mission in cyberspace is inextricably linked to private and commercial technology stakeholders.”^[87]^ No matter how secure or resilient military networks are, it will matter little if private networks are left vulnerable to attack. “Due to the shared risk and mutual vulnerability for both the private and public sectors in cyberspace, the private sector must be an integral partner in any response.”^[88]^ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been charged with securing the.com and.gov domains while the DOD secures the.mil domain.^[89]^ To allow DHS to draw upon the NSA’s cyber capabilities in securing these domains, a memorandum of agreement (MOA) was created in September 2010 establishing a framework for cooperation. Under this MOA, the DHS and DOD each provide personnel, equipment, and facilities in order to increase interdepartmental collaboration, as well as to provide for mutual support in the area of cybersecurity capabilities.^[90]^ This MOA is a step in the right direction but much more has to be Cyber 3.0 183 done in terms of cooperation and collaboration. A collaborative industry-government framework must be put in place where private sector strengths (such as innovation and new technologies) are also drawn upon during times of attack.⁹¹ Traditionally, government responses to cyber threats depend on where the threat originates and the sector that is being targeted. These responder, threat source, and target ambiguities are often difficult to delineate in the cyber domain. FBI Director Robert Muller stated, &gt; The problem from our perspective is we tend to think of it (attack) in particular categories—crime vesus government involvement—and yet at the outset you do not know whether it may be a state actor, a group of individuals operating at the behest of a state actor, or a high school kid across the street.⁹² Government agencies need a collaborative framework to determine the nature of the threat, from where the threat originated and who inevitably directed the attack, so an appropriate response can be formulated.⁹³ Distinct lines of responsibility are not only imperative for a timely government response, but such lines also need to be drawn demarking the responsibility between the government and the private sector. Currently, clear delineation of responsibility between the military and the private sector is lacking.⁹⁴ The question then becomes how to facilitate collaboration and delineation of responsibility. How much overlap between the government and the private sector is required for an effective policy? “The U.S. government has only begun to broach the larger question of whether it is necessary and appropriate to use national resources, such as the defenses that now guard military networks, to protect civilian infrastructure.”⁹⁵ How should this partnership be structured? Where should the boundaries between government and the private sector be drawn to not only protect our critical infrastructure but also protect our civil liberties? While outside the scope of this article, developing complete answers to these questions are at the forefront of policymaking concerns.\n\nD. The Fourth Strategic Initiative: *Build Robust Relationships with U.S. Allies and International Partners to Strengthen Collective Cybersecurity* *Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt and exploit our networks.*⁹⁶ Cyberspace exists on an integrated and global scale. It does not simply reside within the confines of U.S. borders or national sovereignty. Almost a third of the world’s population uses the Internet and there are more than four billion digital wireless devices in the world.⁹⁷ According to Cyber 3.0, “Given the dynamism of cyberspace, nations must work together to defend their common interests and promote security.”⁹⁸ Because cyberspace has the ability to permeate international borders, a collective defense is needed to secure it. “The Internet is a network of networks comprised of thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and billions of end users across the globe. No single state or agency can maintain effective cyber defenses on its own.”⁹⁹ Building a collective defense with our allies and international partners in the area of cybersecurity facilitates information sharing, response to, and the tracking of cyber threats. In cyberspace, as in any domain, operational situational awareness is indispensable. To gain situational awareness in this complex environment, the implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies is essential. Cyber 3.0 provides that the “... DOD will seek increasingly robust international relationships to reflect our core commitments and common interests in cyberspace. The development of international shared situational awareness and warning capabilities will enable collective self-defense and collective deterrence.”¹⁰⁰ By sharing information, intelligence, and cyber capabilities with our allies, the U.S. will be better equipped to mitigate cyber threats and respond to cyber attacks in real time. By fostering partnerships and collaboration on a global scale, a global forensics capability to identify those responsible for attacks can be developed.¹⁰¹ Establishing some measure of accountability in addition to developing the resiliency of national networks requires international cooperation.\nDistributed systems require distributed action.¹⁰² This reflects the reality that no single institution or government is capable to meet the needs of the networked world.¹⁰³ Just as cyberspace can seamlessly flow across national boundaries, so must the situational awareness and capabilities garnered from implementation of collective defenses with U.S. allies. In addition to providing better tracking capabilities of ⁹⁶ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 21.\n⁹⁷ *Id.* at 3.\n⁹⁸ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 2.\n⁹⁹ Miller, *supra* note 34, at 7.\n¹⁰⁰ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 9.\n¹⁰¹ *Id.* at 7.\n¹⁰² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 11.\n¹⁰³ *Id.* Cyber 3.0 185 threats, collective defenses may also be employed to create a cyber threat early warning system which will allow member states to alert one another to cross-border cyber threats.¹⁰⁴ Some commentators have recommended that a duty to assist (akin to a maritime SOS) be created to foster a more immediate and directed response to cyber attacks.¹⁰⁵ Despite the many benefits of international collaboration, collective defenses or the possibility of an international duty to assist, responding to a cyber attack still requires some level of attribution.\nE. The Fifth Strategic Initiative: Leverage the Nation’s Ingenuity Through an Exceptional Cyber Workforce and Rapid Technological Innovation The nation’s people, technology and dynamism provide the DOD with a strong foundation on which to build its military and civilian workforce and advance its technological capabilities.¹⁰⁶ The United States enjoys unparalleled technological resources, which may be brought to bear on the issues of cybersecurity and cyber warfare, by leveraging the nation’s human technological base—the nation’s “geek capital.”¹⁰⁷ The DOD is aware of this fact and is taking steps to explore how U.S. companies and innovators can help mitigate the cyber threat.¹⁰⁸ According to Cyber 3.0 strategy, “The defense of U.S. national security interests in cyberspace depends on the talent and ingenuity of the American people. DOD will catalyze U.S. scientific, academic and economic resources to build a pool of talented civilian and military personnel to operate in cyberspace and achieve DOD objectives.”¹⁰⁹ The strategy recognizes the fact that the United States did much of the ground-breaking research and development in the creation of the Internet and its foundational protocols. A combination of technological innovation, trained cyber personnel, and ingenuity must be leveraged in the cyber domain. According to General Alexander: Purely technological advantages are likely to be fewer and less lasting in our networked world. Our advantage has to lie in how we put these tools together in systems, especially systems of people, protocols and machines that can operate reliably together at high speeds to identify vulnerabilities, share information, assess risks, devise countermeasures and apply new solutions.¹¹⁰ Not only does the fifth initiative focus on the development of specialized personnel to lead in the areas of cyber innovation and cyber security, it also focuses ¹⁰⁴ *Id.* at 13.\n¹⁰⁵ Hollis, *supra* note 46.\n¹⁰⁶ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n¹⁰⁷ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 105.\n¹⁰⁸ *Id.* at 104-107.\n¹⁰⁹ *THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE*, *supra* note 24, at 12.\n¹¹⁰ Alexander, *supra* note 67, at 8.\n\non developing a streamlined acquisition process to keep pace with the racing life cycle of technological development. “It currently takes the Department of Defense approximately eighty-one months to make new computing systems operational. This means that, by the time Department of Defense has fielded its computing systems, they are already three to four generations behind state of the art.”¹¹¹ A cumbersome and bureaucratic acquisition process not only fails to work in this dynamic environment, but it severely limits the nation’s ability to respond to emerging cyber threats. The Department struggles with its acquisition systems. According to Miller, “In a field as dynamic and fluid as cyberspace... we need a much more responsive approach, one that will allow for modular, adaptive investments and technological enhancements.”¹¹² The development and education of skilled cyber operators, as well as a streamlined government acquisition process, is central for the future of national cyber security.\nIt has been effectively argued that insights from other complex systems may serve as guiding principles when dealing with an adaptive response to cyber threats. One commentator suggested that we can best learn from the insights offered from adaption in the field of biology, stating, “The lesson of biology is that survival is not necessarily the reward for the biggest, strongest, or meanest but rather for the most adaptable. The ability to learn, to cooperate when fruitful, and to compete when necessary, will provide the fundamental strengths of those actors seeking cyber power.”¹¹³ From this lesson of biology, it becomes clear that the ability to adapt in the cyber domain is central to the ability to operate effectively. Technology alone does not carry the day, rather, the development and education of highly trained cyber operators will allow competitive edge to be maintained.¹¹⁴ Leveraging the nation’s “geek capital” is where this ability to adapt in this ever-changing environment begins. Other nations, to include China and Iran, have realized this fact and have already begun the race to educate, train and equip their cyber operators. The United States should be doing the same with a renewed sense of urgency and vigor.\n## III. A SIXTH STRATEGIC INITIATIVE: DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ATTRIBUTION AND RESPONSE (PROPOSED) To exercise its right of self-defense against a hostile actor, the United States must attribute the attack to that hostile actor. This ability to detect, and thus attribute, an attack is critical for both the operational response to the attack and in dealing with the diplomatic and legal fallout.¹¹⁵ The five strategic initiatives of Cyber 3.0 make clear that cyberspace is the emerging threat environment of the 21st century. Its five initiatives lend much ¹¹¹ 2012 Budget Request, supra note 34, at 9.\n¹¹² Id. at 10.\n¹¹³ Rattray, supra note 84, at 274.\n¹¹⁴ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, supra note 24, at 11.\n¹¹⁵ Darren C.

But what the strategy does not offer is a sound foundation for deterrence through retaliation or a clearly stated strategic intention to change an attacker’s cost/benefit analysis before launching an attack. According to Dr. Libecki, Deterrence consists of essentially two basic components: first, the expressed intention to defend a certain interest; secondly, the demonstrated capability actually to achieve the defense of the interest in question, or to inflict such a cost on the attacker that, even if he should be able to gain his end, the undertaking would not seem worth the effort to him.¹¹⁶ A narrower definition of deterrence is the ability to persuade others not to attack you because doing so would result in retaliation.¹¹⁷ This article refers to this traditional model of deterrence as “deterrence by threat of retaliation.”\nWhile deterrence through denial or “peace through preventive defense” is the cornerstone of the Cyber 3.0 strategy,¹¹⁸ deterrence by threat of retaliation must not be left out of the strategic picture. General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees with this criticism and has even commented that the new strategy is “way too predictable.”¹¹⁹ He went on to say, “It’s purely defensive. There is no penalty for attacking us now. We’ve got to figure out a way to change that.”¹²⁰ Stewart Baker, former National Security Agency general counsel, went a step further, offering his critique: “This is at best a partial strategy. The plan as described fails to engage on the hard issues, such as offense and attribution and, well, winning.”¹²¹ Deterrence by threat of retaliation, while difficult to implement in the cyber domain, remains a useful and necessary part of the U.S. national cyber strategy. According to the White House’s International Strategy for Cyberspace, released in May 2011: When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states possess an inherent right to self-defense... We reserve the right to use all necessary means—diplomatic, informational, military and economic—as appropriate and consistent with applicable ¹¹⁶ W.W.

It would be irresponsible, and a failure of the Defense Department’s mission, to leave the nation vulnerable to a known threat. Just as the military defends against hostile acts from land, air, and sea it must also be prepared to respond to hostile acts in cyberspace. Accordingly, the United States reserves the right, under the law of armed conflict, to respond to serious cyberattacks with appropriate, proportional, and justified military response.¹²³ Unfortunately, without the capabilities of attribution, the threat of effective retaliation in the cyber domain is an empty one. Without solid attribution, those who would attack us suffer little fear of reprisal and will continue to declare open season on the testing, breaching and compromise of U.S. networks. The ability to respond in cyberspace, through conventional or nonconventional means, however, does not precisely fall in the traditional deterrence framework of having an easily identifiable adversary. As Steiner put it, “If one is to retaliate against a cyberspace actor in the physical domain—where retaliatory options historically lie—by legal, political, economic or military means, one must first establish connections between the cyberspace actor and his or her physical-world counterpart.”¹²⁴ Attribution is important for other strategic reasons. The *International Strategy for Cyberspace*, recognizes this by stating that “[t]he United States will ensure the risks associated with attacking or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits.”¹²⁵ To accomplish this, deterrence by retaliation must become a realistic option. The challenge becomes as General Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency, put it, “How do we deal with the unprecedented?”¹²⁶ Hayden explains, “Part of our cyber policy is that its newness and our familiar experience in physical space do not easily transfer to cyberspace. Casually applying well-known concepts from physical space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure.”¹²⁷ The traditional construct of deterrence, the promise of assured retaliation, for all intents and purposes has been rendered conceptually ineffectual in Cyber 3.0.\n¹²² THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 14.\n¹²³ Lynn, *supra* note 118.\n¹²⁴ Eric Sterner, *Retaliatory Deterrence in Cyberspace*, STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY (SSQ), AU Press. 62, 66,, available at www.au.af.mil/au/ssq/2011/spring/sterner.pdf.\n¹²⁵ THE WHITE HOUSE, *supra* note 1, at 13.\n¹²⁶ General Michael V.

Despite the difficulty in effectively identifying an attacker, it is clear that the current administration does not intend to abandon this traditional model of deterrence completely. A lack of adequate attribution, however, could be the Achilles heel of Cyber 3.0. While Cyber 3.0 is a step in the right direction by recognizing the many challenges of cyberspace and its continuing evolution, it must also confront the technical limitations of attribution and embrace the value of developing a framework for threat response. Following this notion, a *sixth strategic initiative*, one grounded on a viable framework of attribution and response, is a logical addition to the Cyber 3.0 strategy.\n## A. Attribution and the Law of War The Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), various U.N. Treaties, and customary international law provide much of the legal constraints on the use of active defense and offensive cyber operations. Before discussing the law that applies to active defense and offensive cyber operations, it is important to understand the basic international norms that apply to the use of force.\nThe United Nations Charter provides the framework for the use of force under international law. Specifically Article 2(4) states “all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”¹²⁸ Article 2(4) is viewed as a basic principle from which states are not allowed to deviate with two exceptions. The Charter authorizes the use of force in situations set out in Article 42, which states, “If peaceful means have not succeeded in obtaining adherence to Security Council decisions, the Security Council may take such action... as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.”¹²⁹ Article 51 is the second exception to Article 2(4)’s prohibition on the threat or use of force, codifying the customary international right to use force in self-defence. Article 51 provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.”¹³⁰ Through this language, Article 51 preserves the long-standing principle that a nation has the inherent right to defend itself. The key question then becomes what is considered an “armed attack” in the cyber domain and how is this conduct delineated from other conduct which falls below the use of force threshold?\nCentral to the question of how a nation can respond to an attack is whether the intrusion constitutes a “use of force.” Typically, a computer network attack (CNA) can be characterized in three ways: “First, as an action which falls below the threshold of use of force; second, as conduct that is equivalent to a use of force ¹²⁸ U.N. Charter art. 2(4).\n¹²⁹ U.N. Charter art. 42.\n¹³⁰ U.N. Charter art. 51.\n\nbut is short of an armed attack; or third, as conduct which equates to an armed attack.\"¹³¹ There is general consensus among legal and military scholars that, for a cyber attack to be considered an armed attack, the consequences of the conduct must be equivalent to the results of a traditional kinetic attack—typically death, destruction, or injury. According to Professor Michael Schmitt, “There is little debate that conduct which specifically intends to cause physical damage/destruction to tangible property or injury or death to human beings is reasonably characterized as a use of armed force.”¹³² This approach is known as an “instrument-based approach.”¹³³ Under this model, an assessment is made as to whether the damage caused by the attack is comparable to damage which previously could have only been achieved through kinetic attack.¹³⁴ Walker Gary Sharp, Sr. argues for an even broader standard stating, “Any computer network attack that intentionally causes any destructive effect within the sovereign territory of another state is an unlawful use of force that may constitute an armed attack prompting the right to self-defense.”¹³⁵ The true dilemma, however, is how to characterize conduct which does not cause physical damage or injury, and how to respond to such conduct. An analytical model which attempts to answer this question was developed by Professor Schmitt and is known as the “effects-based” or “consequence-based” approach.¹³⁶ Schmitt focuses on the consequences of an attack rather than the target or the intentions of the attacker. Under this approach, no attempt is made to assess whether the damage caused by the attack is akin to damage caused by a kinetic use of force.¹³⁷ Here, the consideration is placed on the overall effect of the attack on the victim state. Schmitt believes that a use of force is not confined to traditional “physical or kinetic force applied by conventional weapons.”¹³⁸ In attempting to delineate the level of an attack in the space and cyber domains, the “Schmitt Test” as outlined in Schmitt’s article on computer network attack is particularly relevant. In his article, Schmitt puts forth six criteria to delimit conduct which does not rise to the use of armed force.¹³⁹ These criteria are: (1) Severity: Armed attacks threaten physical injury or destruction of property to a much greater degree than other forms of coercion.\n(2) Immediacy: The negative consequences of armed coercion, or threat thereof, usually occur with great immediacy, while those of other forms of coercion develop more slowly.\nCyber 3.0 191 (3) Directness: The consequences of armed coercion are more directly tied to the actus reus than in other forms of coercion, which often depend on numerous contributory factors to operate.\n(4) Invasiveness: In armed coercion, the act causing the harm usually crosses into the target state, whereas in economic warfare the acts generally occur beyond the target’s borders. As a result, even though armed and economic acts may have roughly similar consequences, the former represents a greater intrusion on the rights of the target state and, therefore, is more likely to disrupt international stability.\n(5) Measurability: While the consequences of armed coercion are usually easy to ascertain (e.g., a certain level of destruction), the actual negative consequences of other forms of coercion are harder to measure.\n(6) Presumptive Legitimacy: In most cases, whether under domestic or international law, the application of violence is deemed illegitimate absent some specific exception such as self-defense.\nBy applying this “consequence-based” approach to conduct in the cyber domain, it allows the military to identify conduct that would constitute an armed attack.\nThe final analytical model is one based on the notion of “strict liability” which would automatically label any cyber attack against critical national infrastructure to be an armed attack based on the dire consequences such an attack would have.¹⁴⁰ For instance a cyber attack launched against the nation’s power grid, crippling it, would be considered an armed attack based on the damage/national paralysis it would cause. Under the “strict liability” analytical model, this category of cyber attack would automatically constitute an armed attack.\nOnce conduct has been found to constitute an armed attack, the next step in the analysis is to determine whether the attack can be attributed to the appropriate actor. Establishing another state’s responsibility is a critical next step to enable the victim state to use force to respond to a cyber attack as a legitimate exercise of its right to self-defense under the U.N. Charter.¹⁴¹ What limitations apply to the implementation and use of active defense or to the use of force to respond to cyber attacks? First, states must not launch retaliatory actions that qualify as a use of force absent U.N. Security Council authorization unless it is exercising its inherent right of self-defense in response to an armed attack.¹⁴² Typically, active defenses and cyber counterstrikes are predicated on the principle of self-defense under Article 51. Second, states must not deploy active ¹⁴⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 91.\n¹⁴¹ *Id.* at 92.\n¹⁴² U.N. Charter arts. 2(4), 42, 51.\n\ndefenses or cyber counterstrikes that violate the laws of war. It is important to note that cyber attacks can be routed through third parties or neutral states, which may be harmed by a counterstrike running through their systems.¹⁴³ This implicates well-known legal principles of war such as necessity, distinction, and proportionality. Military necessity authorizes the use of force required to accomplish the mission. Distinction requires that military combatants and targets be distinguished from protected civilian parties and property. The concept of proportionality, under the law of war, dictates that the damage inflicted while responding to an attack must not be excessive in relation to the military objective or advantage.\nThese key principles of the law of war apply to active defense and cyber counterstrikes just as they would to more traditional forms of combat. In sum, states must avoid cyber operations which target civilians, cause indiscriminate harm, or violate the neutrality of neutral states.¹⁴⁴ Finally, states must respect the sovereignty of other states in responding to cyber attacks that do not constitute a use of force or do not constitute an armed attack.¹⁴⁵ Before a victim state may legitimately use force the state must possess the ability to adequately attribute responsibility for such attack to another state or group of actors. A victim state cannot lawfully launch a response without knowing the identity of the attacker. The response cannot be indiscriminate. If the appropriate framework of attribution and response is not in place, those who aim to attack the U.S. may act with impunity and with little fear of reprisal.\nThe problem then becomes the capability to attribute the original cyber attack directly and conclusively to another state or agents under that state’s direct control. This attribution would be viewed as a precursor to any sort of cyber counterstrike in order to avoid collateral damage or injury of innocents/neutrals. Given the inherent anonymity of the technology involved, attribution of a cyber attack can be time-consuming and difficult to conclusively identify the entity initiating or directing the attack.\nOne potential solution to the attribution problem is the use of imputed state responsibility. Imputed attribution can be used against states that harbor or allow attacks from within their borders.¹⁴⁶ The concept of imputed state responsibility for cyber attacks is based on a state’s violation of what is viewed as an established duty to prevent one’s territory from being used as a haven or sanctuary for those launching terrorist or cyber attacks.¹⁴⁷ Consistent with this approach, a state is said to have breached this duty when it consistently fails to undertake measures to prevent or legally respond to these attacks.¹⁴⁸ Regardless, however, of what level ¹⁴³ Kesan &amp; Hayes, supra note 68, at 35-39.\n¹⁴⁴ Hollis, supra note 46.

According to Libecki, “The medium is fraught with ambiguities about who attacked and why, about what they achieved and whether they can do it again.”¹⁴⁹ It has been stated that attributing cyber attacks is untenable and because of this fact, deterrence by threat of response in the cyber domain is unrealistic. According to Commander Todd Huntley, “Cyberattacks are not accompanied by calling cards. Perhaps the single greatest challenge to the application of the law of armed conflict to cyber activity is the challenge of attribution.”¹⁵⁰ For this reason it has been suggested that the thorn of attribution should be left to fester. It has been further argued that developing a solution to the attribution problem is just a waste of time and resources—instead, the nation should focus on network resiliency and redundancy. By accepting this shortsighted approach, however, national cyber defenses remain exposed, and operators can only determine how many direct hits our networks can absorb before slipping under the vast sea of ones and zeros. As Eric Sterner, a fellow at the George C. Marshall Institute put it, “Left with few retaliatory options, the defender can only hope to ensure that its defenses are better than the challenger’s offenses and take steps to manage the risks and consequences of losing the offense-defense equation.”¹⁵¹ Secretary Lynn has defended the deterrence by denial approach: Our strategy’s overriding emphasis is on denying the benefits of an attack. Rather than rely on the threat of retaliation alone to deter attacks in cyberspace, we aim to change our adversaries’ incentives in a more fundamental way. If an attack will not have its intended effect, those who would wish us harm will have less reason to target us thorough cyberspace in the first place.¹⁵² While deterrence by denial is the primary strategy of deterrence considered by Cyber 3.0, it should not be the only one. Sterner posits, “In the end, risk management and consequence-management policies will help allocate resources... nevertheless, their limitation lies in the fact that they divorce cybersecurity from cyber conflict and the attack from the attacker.”¹⁵³ In determining whether the U.S. can employ active defense technology and cyber counterstrikes to neutralize cyber threats, the concept of attribution remains central to the response equation. If the U.S. desires the ability to respond to a cyber attack with retaliatory or employ ¹⁴⁹ LIBECKI, supra note 42, at Preface.\n¹⁵⁰ Commander Todd C.

First and foremost, there is architectural anonymity in cyberspace.¹⁵⁵ The Internet lacks a solid identity system, demonstrating that an attacker may easily spoof their IP address or obfuscate their identity. IP address spoofing software is readily available to even amateur users of the Internet and novice hackers.¹⁵⁶ One can only imagine the level of sophisticated techniques and technologies that can be employed by state-sponsored operators. These techniques and technologies not only cloak attackers in a veil of anonymity but also add a virtual distance between the victim of an attack and the perpetrator of the attack. This virtual distance, coupled with the ability to cloak one’s identity, makes cyberspace a digital proving ground for new technologies of intrusion, exploitation and attack. Second, neutral, third-party, or compromised intermediary systems are often left to blame while the original attackers remain unknown and untouched.\nDespite its many difficulties, ascertaining the nature (target) of an attack, along with the source of the attack should be part of the equation in the formulation of an appropriate response. Without this initial undertaking of attribution, deterrence by threat of retaliation is left impotent. “Attribution is necessary before a group can take any action including offensive computer attacks, arrests, lawsuits or kinetic attack.”¹⁵⁷ Unfortunately, cyber attacks, like the Internet packets that carry them, easily cross jurisdictional lines. When this happens, successful attribution becomes dependent not only on the available technology and forensic digital evidence left behind from an attack, but also upon international cooperation between allies. “Cyber attackers are taking advantage of the fact that routing an attack through countries that are not on the best of terms with the target country will effectively conceal their identity and location.”¹⁵⁸ While development of new technologies or inference from the target/nature of the attack may narrow the field of usual suspects, it is also likely that a technologically-savvy adversary will be able to cloak its attack as coming from a ¹⁵⁴ Attribution can be direct or indirect, however, the governing principle of state responsibility under international law has been that the conduct of private actors is not attributable to the state unless the state has directly and explicitly delegated a part of its tasks and functions to the private entity.

Graham, former Chief of the International/Operations Division of the Judge Advocate General of the Army, given the difficulties raised by the traditional requirement to attribute attacks conclusively and directly to a state, there has been a growing effort to formulate acceptable legal alternatives to the notion of “conclusive attribution.”¹⁶⁰ One such alternative, as previously mentioned, is imputing state responsibility for cyber attacks.¹⁶¹ What becomes apparent, however, is that some level of attribution remains central to our capability to respond, even with the option of imputing state responsibility. Having a framework of attribution in place, based on foresight and preparation, will provide the necessary situational awareness to determine a legal and appropriate course of action.\nSituational awareness in cyberspace begins with being aware that an attack is occurring, which systems are being attacked, and what options are available to marshal an appropriate response. In order to accomplish sufficient attribution, the U.S. must depend on technological innovation, better intelligence, and international cooperation. If attribution is to have any value in the deterrence process, the intelligence and situational awareness it provides must be accurate, timely, and actionable. It also must be made clear to the attacker that they have been exposed to have any deterrent effect. This can be accomplished by establishing clear and unambiguous response policies. Implementing these policies puts attackers on notice that there will be serious consequences for their conduct. Having unambiguous policies of threat response makes it apparent to those who attempt to attack the U.S., or to states harboring those who would attack the U.S., that they will be held responsible for conduct arising from within their borders or sphere of control. To do this effectively, attribution technologies must be able to peel back the digital layers of obfuscation to hone in on attackers, and must be able to do so in an efficient manner. While Cyber 3.0 deals with making U.S. networks and critical infrastructure more resilient to attacks, it also must recognize the value of situational awareness provided by the often-maligned concept of attribution.\n## B. Proposed Attribution Framework It is largely agreed upon that attribution in cyberspace is not a perfect science nor is it a minor undertaking. After all, a measure of anonymity is inherent in the basic structure of the Internet. The Internet was originally designed to ensure communication lines remained open despite a kinetic (read: nuclear) attack on U.S. Infrastructure. The Internet’s original design did not account for the asymmetric cyber attacks that are being utilized today nor was it designed to make attribution and identification a priority. According to Paul Rosenzweig, a visiting fellow at Heritage Foundation, “As originally conceived, the cyber domain serves simply as a giant switching system, routing data around the globe using general internet protocols. It embeds no other function (like identity or verification of delivery) ¹⁵⁹ Huntley, *supra* note 150, at 38.\n¹⁶⁰ Graham, *supra* note 79, at 93.\n¹⁶¹ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 1; David E. Graham, *supra* note 79, at 92.\n\ninto the protocols.\"¹⁶² Despite these architectural conundrums, attribution remains an important part of the national response framework.\nWhile attribution and response are not warranted for every level of cyber incursion (to do so would be ineffective and inefficient) such concepts should be utilized for cyber attacks that pose significant threat or cause significant harm. Attribution is necessary in these cases as a response to a cyber attack is often contingent on the nature of the attack and the attacker. For instance, the response would be different in scope and execution if the attack came from a terrorist group, or a foreign national power, than if it came from a teenage hacker in a darkened basement.¹⁶³ On June 14, 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Senate’s website, Senate.gov, was hacked by a group calling themselves “LulzSec.”¹⁶⁴ The LulzSec hackers posted a configuration file for the Senate’s website online. Interestingly, the hackers stated in a news release, “This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from Senate.gov. Is this an act of war, gentlemen?”¹⁶⁵ Certainly, this “just-for-kicks” release of data would not rise to an act of war and would likely only necessitate a criminal investigation. In this example, the who—LulzSec—and the what—hacked Senate.gov—are clear. Unfortunately, in the cyber domain this is not always the case. This is why the concept of attribution is important to the response equation.\nDetermining the original source of the attack, while not a critical factor in the success of passive defenses, is central to determining if a retaliatory response is possible. Attribution also identifies the appropriate entity to respond to an attack. The roles, combinations, and responsibilities of government agencies, and the private sector need to be defined. To do this attribution must be made a part of the deliberative process. If deterrence by retaliation is to be a part of the nation’s cyber security strategy, several key issues must be addressed:¹⁶⁶ These key issues include: What level of certainty/attribution is required to respond to an attack? What are the practical and technical limitations of attribution? And how can deterrence by retaliation be effective in cyberspace? To answer these questions, a realistic framework for attribution needs to be developed and implemented.\nTo understand how a framework for attribution would be useful as a *sixth initiative* of Cyber 3.0, we must first note the different kinds of environments where attack attribution can be made and then discuss the different technical levels of attribution that are required in each given situation. The first and most prevalent ¹⁶² Rosenzweig, *supra* note 75 at 31.\n¹⁶³ Katherine Stephens, *Cyberspace National Policy Considerations*, NATIONAL SECURITY CYBERSPACE INSTITUTE (Nov. 16, 2010), available at http://www.nsci-va.org/WhitePapers.htm.\n¹⁶⁴ Andrew Morse &amp; Ian Sherr, *Senate Website Gets Hacked*, WALL ST.

Knake, International Affairs Fellow in Residence, the Council on Foreign Relations), available at http://www.cfr.org/united-states/untangling-attribution-moving-accountability-cyberspace/p22630.\nCyber 3.0 197 attribution problem deals with tracing attacks carried out over the Internet and its associated networks.¹⁶⁷ A traceback approach, where the attack sequence is traced to its source, is typically applied to such situations. Traceback, however, is often difficult to achieve due to the underlying architecture of the Internet, use of anonymity technologies, obfuscation, and the use of multi-stage attacks. “Cyberattacks are frequently conducted though intermediate computer systems to disguise the true identity of an attacker.”¹⁶⁸ For example, Iranian nationalistic hackers may route their attack through intermediate servers in Hong Kong making it appear that the attack originated from Hong Kong rather than Tehran.\nThe second attribution problem deals with cyberattacks that are not carried out via the Internet. Rather, the attacks are carried out against networks which exist independently (air-gapped) by infiltrating these networks using a removable device such as a USB flash drive.¹⁶⁹ This variety of attack bridges the “air-gap” of secure systems and compromises them. An “air-gapped” network is a measure undertaken to create a secure computer network by isolating it from insecure networks (such as the public internet) both physically and electromagnetically.¹⁷⁰ Classified networks are often “air-gapped” to prevent malicious software from spreading. An example of this sort of attack on an “air-gapped” network occurred in 2008 when the DOD suffered a significant compromise of its classified military computer networks.¹⁷¹ An infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop, which delivered malicious code placed there by a foreign intelligence agency. The malicious code then uploaded itself onto a secure network managed by U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). The Pentagon’s operation to counter this effective attack was known as “Operation Buckshot Yankee.”¹⁷² For attacks such as the Buckshot Yankee incident, attribution takes on the guise of a criminal computer forensic criminal case, using digital and real-world evidence to build a case against a particular perpetrator. In cases where malicious code is introduced into secure or classified networks, computer forensic techniques, criminal investigative techniques, and intelligence-gathering techniques can be used to traceback the origin of the attack.¹⁷³ Finally, there is the problem of attribution for the introduction of malicious code via the material supply chain where “back-doors” are built into the system via hardware and software applications that we utilize to construct our networks.¹⁷⁴ For instance, malicious code pre-loaded in computer hardware or memory. While outside of the scope of this article, these problems of attribution can be resolved ¹⁶⁷ *Id.* at 2.\n¹⁶⁸ Skelrov, *supra* note 70, at 77-78.\n¹⁶⁹ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2.\n¹⁷⁰ Robert Lemos, *NSA Attempting to Design Crack-Proof Computer*, ZDNET News (1 Feb 2001), available at http://www.zdnet.com/news/nsa-attempting-to-design-crack-proof-computer/114035; see also Oliver Rist, *Hack Tales: Air-gap Networking for the Price of a Pair of Sneakers*, Infoworld (29 May 2006), available at http://www.infoworld.com/d/networking/hack-tales-air-gap-networking-price-pair-sneakers-610.\n¹⁷¹ Lynn, *supra* note 14, at 97.\n¹⁷² *Id.* ¹⁷³ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 2-3.\n¹⁷⁴ *Id.* at 3.\n\nby a more robust and secure acquisition process coupled with traditional criminal investigative techniques. For a visual depiction of the attribution problem refer to (Figure 1: “The Attribution Problem”).[175] (Figure 1: The\"Attribution Problem\") Cyber 3.0 199 Attribution on the Internet can be broken down into three distinct technological and practical levels. The first level of attribution is determining the physical location of the machine which is transmitting the attack.¹⁷⁶ This typically entails identification/location of the offending IP address. The second level of attribution on the Internet is determining the owner of the machine as opposed to the actual operator responsible for the attack.¹⁷⁷ It is important to note that the owner of the machine may not be the individual or entities originating the attack as attacks are often routed though neutral or innocent compromised systems. Finally, the third level of attribution on the Internet, and the most technologically challenging level of attribution, is attempting to determine the original individual or entity that is responsible for launching the attack.¹⁷⁸ Understanding the various levels of attribution and their intrinsic values is the initial step in constructing a response framework. Once the technical level of attribution has been settled, it must be determined what sort of attribution is required based on the nature of the intrusion or attack. To accomplish this, it must be determined what sort of cyber threat is being encountered and what aspects of attribution are required to adequately address each threat.\nAcademics in the area have proposed attributing responsibility for an attack based on various factors including (1) the type of the attack used, (2) the target of the attack, or (3) the country of origin.¹⁷⁹ However, none of these are dependable indicators for sourcing an attack. The fact that an attack has occurred often reveals little about its creators or their motivations.¹⁸⁰ Other commentators, however, have noted that for the most serious of cyber threats, the “Cyber Pearl Harbors,” the technical attribution problem at this time is largely overstated.¹⁸¹ According to Robert Knake, former International Affairs Fellow in Residence at the Council on Foreign Relations, As with other Internet-based attacks, technical attribution may be difficult and the forensic work will take time, but at present there are a limited number of actors that are capable of carrying out such attacks. Moreover, the resources, planning, and timeline for such attacks would provide many opportunities to identify and disrupt such attacks.¹⁸² The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68 This attack capability, however, will not remain static, as more and more actors will develop ever more sophisticated attack capabilities. The continued development of sophisticated attack capabilities demonstrates the need for an attribution framework and application of the appropriate technical level of attribution to a particular threat category.\nIn addition to the technical levels of attribution, there are distinct threat categories that require different applications of attribution. Threats can be divided into the following categories: cyber warfare, cyber espionage, brute force attacks, cyber crime, and cyber nuisance.¹⁸³ In their article, *Untangling Attribution*, David D. Clark and Susan Landau submit that different types of cyber attacks and cyber exploitations raise different options for prevention and deterrence.¹⁸⁴ Clark and Landau aptly apply four aspects of attribution to determine what technical level of attribution is required. These aspects include attribution *type*, *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁸⁵ Application of these four aspects of attribution provides a sound foundation for a framework of attribution.\n*Type*. The most typical form of attribution is IP identification, which is identifying the IP address of the offending machine. While this form of attribution is readily available and provides some measure of identification, it is useful only for a topical level of identifying the machine that is transmitting malicious code.¹⁸⁶ This level of attribution is useful for an emergent or immediate response—for example, blocking a machine from further access to the network—but does little in providing a legal basis for a retaliatory response. “During an attack, when the goal is mitigation, it is not generally useful to identify the responsible person; what is needed is to deal with the machines that are the source of the attack. This sort of attribution is usually associated with IP address.”¹⁸⁷ In order for attribution to lend itself to the concept of deterrence by retaliation, this initial level of attribution—that of machine level attribution is of little assistance.\nCertainly the aggressor in the cyber domain carries the tactical advantage of speed, surprise, and anonymity. This capability is in large part due to the architecture of the Internet and its transmission protocols.¹⁸⁸ A cyber attacker can launch a ¹⁸³ *Id.* ¹⁸⁴ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n¹⁸⁵ *Id.* ¹⁸⁶ *Id.* at 33-34.\n¹⁸⁷ *Id.* at 37.\n¹⁸⁸ “Attributing an attack to a particular source or set of sources requires understanding what can happen to the packets used to perpetuate the attack as they traverse the network. The IP routing infrastructure is stateless and based largely on destination addresses; the source address plays virtually no role in the forwarding of a packet to its destination other than providing a return address in the case of bidirectional communication. In this respect, IP packets are essentially fire-and-forget types of delivery mechanisms; once a packet is introduced into the network, there is no need for the packet to maintain any relationship with its source. The source IP address carries no semantic of trust, but it is the only clue built into the network infrastructure as to the proper source. Attackers take advantage of this property of the IP protocol by manipulating—either directly or indirectly—the source address of attack packets to obscure their true origin.” W. Timothy Strayer et al., *An Integrated Architecture for Attack Attribution*, BNN TECHNOLOGIES 1 (Dec. 31 2003), available at http://www.ir.bbn.com/documents/techreports/TR8384.ps.\nCyber 3.0 201 new attack from the safety of an anonymous computer system from thousands of miles away with devastating effect. This combination of anonymity and distance makes attack via the Internet a lucrative and low-risk environment to conduct cyber operations.\nOne of the most effective ways to remain anonymous on the Internet during an attack is to obfuscate the original source of the attack by routing the attack through neutral or innocent intermediaries creating a “multi-stage” or “extended-connection” attack.¹⁸⁹ These intermediaries who constitute a multi-state attack are typically called “stepping stones” as demonstrated below in Figure 2.¹⁹⁰ (Figure 2: Multi-stage Attack) Sophisticated multi-stage attacks do not lend themselves to attribution and remain a substantial obstacle to the ability to respond directly against an attacker and impart any sort of deterrent effect. Despite these difficulties, attribution at the identity level is necessary to respond to, rather than merely defend against, cyber attacks.¹⁹¹ The continued evolution of the threat environment not only mandates that we ensure the resilience and defense of critical defense systems, but it also means the nation must continue to develop functional attribution technologies, policies, and strategies to deal with this challenge. According to Knake, As the relevant technologies continue to evolve, it is important that the difficulty in carrying out significant attacks also increases. Our critical industries, military, and government agencies must The Air Force Law Review • Volume 68 continue to raise their defense levels in order to keep the ability to cause destruction in the hands of a limited number of state actors.¹⁹² Other key elements in determining what technical level of attribution is required in any given situation are the concepts of *timing/immediacy*, *investigation* and *jurisdiction*.¹⁹³ *Timing/Immediacy.* The timing/immediacy of a threat also influences what level of technical attribution is required. Timing can be broken down into four categories:¹⁹⁴ (1) Before the fact: prevention or degradation; (2) During the fact: mitigation; (3) After the fact: retribution and retaliation; and (4) Ongoing: attribution as part of routine activity. Deterrence by denial typically does not require attribution to a particular malicious actor.¹⁹⁵ Rather, these defenses rely on passive defense, network hygiene, and computer security. It is important to note, however, that by relying on only a risk-management or deterrence by denial framework, the initiative is always ceded to an attacker.¹⁹⁶ “Without imposing the consequences of a counterattack—strategic, operational, or tactical—on an attacker, the defender is merely taking a beating.”¹⁹⁷ This purely defensive posture is not optimal in the cyber domain.\nAttribution at the machine level is typically required during a cyber attack. During a cyber attack, the primary objective is to stop or mitigate the attack through the use of active defense technology.¹⁹⁸ In this situation, attribution is focused on the immediate threat to the system, the machine attacking, or point of network vulnerability. Knowing who directed the attack is not as important at this stage. After the attack is complete, however, technical attribution takes on a critical role.¹⁹⁹ When retribution or deterrence by retaliation is desired, it is important to take the time, intention, and due diligence to ensure the correct actor has been identified and targeted. This level of attribution is by far the most technically complicated and convoluted due to the dynamics of multi-stage attacks as previously discussed. According to Clark and Landau, attribution in this area should be a primary focus of the research community and military strategists.²⁰⁰ Finally, a measure of attribution may be required for the normal operation of secure networks.²⁰¹ This level of attribution is usually based on identification/authentication of users and technologies on a given network and ensures conduct can be logged and traced on that network.²⁰² *Investigation.* When dealing with an attribution framework it is also important to be able to identify what type of threat has presented itself, who will be investigating the incident, and who has jurisdiction. Being able to distinguish between ¹⁹² Knake, *supra* note 166, at 5.\n¹⁹³ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 32.\n¹⁹⁴ *Id.* at 34-35.\n¹⁹⁵ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 67.\n¹⁹⁶ *Id.* at 69.\n¹⁹⁷ *Id.* ¹⁹⁸ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 34.\n¹⁹⁹ *Id.* at 35.\n²⁰⁰ *Id.* at 39.\n²⁰¹ *Id.* at 25.\n²⁰² *Id.* at 35.\nCyber 3.0 203 attacks on critical infrastructure versus espionage versus criminal misconduct, drives what technical level of attribution is required and sophistication of the response. “There are various sorts of deterrence that might be imagined; these have different implications for the needed quality and precision of the attribution. Different actors—police, intelligence services, and the military will benefit from different sorts of attribution.”²⁰³ For example, in the area of cyber crime, attribution is utilized to aid in criminal investigation and prosecution. In criminal investigations, attribution needs only to rise to the level of “probable cause” to initiate the investigation and would likely begin at the machine level.²⁰⁴ *Jurisdiction.* A determination of who has jurisdiction also implicates what level of attribution is required. The architecture and the infrastructure of the Internet do not reside in one locale, one territory, or one jurisdiction, nor does the data that flows across its networks. As noted in Section II, cyberspace “seamlessly intersects other domains as well as geographic and recognized political boundaries.” Jurisdictional issues abound in cyberspace and with these issues arise numerous technical and legal implications. “Different parts of the Internet operate within different jurisdictions, different countries, different legal systems, and (within these jurisdictions) both as public and as private-sector activities. Any discussion of attribution must consider jurisdictional issues.”²⁰⁵ A framework of attribution must be malleable enough to provide a legal basis when needed, technological certainty when required, and reliable evidence when warranted. There is no comparable “silver-bullet” when applying the concept and constraints of attribution to cyberspace. There is, however, the fundamental notion that attribution should not be abandoned because of the many challenges it presents. Certainly the problems and complexities of attribution are many. By recognizing its relevance in the context of Cyber 3.0, the U.S. can continue to develop its capability to respond to future cyber threats.\nWhile deterrence by retaliation should not be the U.S.’s primary means of securing its networks (making systems more resilient to attack is more feasible) it should become a part of the response equation. According to Eric Sterner, “It will take a series of visible retaliatory actions—political, economic, military, and cyber—over time to create a reasonable, if not certain, expectation of the risk of punishment for potential attackers.”²⁰⁶ The key here is to understand the strategic benefits and technical limitations of attribution as outlined in this article and move beyond the quest for absolute or perfect attribution. As Sterner further notes, &gt; Given the stakes involved for the United States, policymakers must explore all measures available to improve US security. Attribution and deterrence in cyberspace will not become a first, second, or even third line of defense. Risk and consequence management and the improvement of defenses at the point of attack are likely ²⁰³ *Id.* ²⁰⁴ Knake, *supra* note 166, at 6.\n²⁰⁵ Clark &amp; Landau, *supra* note 176, at 35.\n²⁰⁶ Sterner, *supra* note 124, at 62, 76.\n\nto long dominate US security in cyberspace. But, deterrence may yet contribute to security by helping contain the severity and frequency of attacks and focusing attention on cyber conflict as the interaction of conscious actors whose decision-making processes can be influenced.²⁰⁷ While attribution at its best should positively identify an attacker (state or state agent), a more realistic approach is that a reasonable technical level of attribution is obtained, for example, identification of the location of an attacking server or machine. Once identified, countermeasures and active defense could be employed to interrupt or counter the malicious signal in real time, providing for an immediate response. If further, more aggressive response is required, more complete technical/forensic attribution can then be pursued. A recent DOD report to Congress provides that the Department recognizes that deterring malicious actors is complicated by the difficulty of verifying the location from which an attack is launched and by the need to identify the attacker among many potential actors.²⁰⁸ Taking this into consideration, the DOD is actively seeking to increase its attribution capabilities by supporting research and development in both the DOD and private sector. According to the report, this research focuses on two primary areas: developing new trace capabilities and utilization of behavior-based algorithms to assist in identifying attackers.²⁰⁹ Both initiatives are based on further technological innovation to improve cyber forensic capabilities.\nIt is important to note, however, that pure technological innovation alone is ineffectual. While technology may be developed to increase domain situational awareness to assist in the attribution of an attack, it is also likely that other technologies will also be developed by our adversaries to cloak their activities and counter this situational awareness. Policy, law, and strategy then dictate how a response to an attack will be justified and what level of attribution is required. As stated before, applying old modalities and antiquated strategy from the traditional domains does not translate well in the cyber domain.²¹⁰ Therefore, a balance of technology, law, and policy is required to facilitate not only security in the cyber domain but also continued growth, innovation, and freedom.\n## IV.

Given this broad landscape of activity in cyberspace, we must both protect its peaceful, shared uses as well as prepare for hostile cyber acts that threaten our national security.²¹¹ Developing a workable framework of attribution and response should be considered in the Cyber 3.0 strategy as a sixth strategic initiative. This recommended framework of attribution both recognizes the technological, legal, and practical limitations of attribution in cyberspace while at the same time demonstrates that attribution and deterrence by retaliation should remain important elements of the U.S.’s cybersecurity vision. It is clear that national security is being redefined by cyberspace and that Cyber 3.0’s five strategic initiatives provide a road map for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace, defend national interests, and achieve national security objectives.²¹² There remain, however, significant technological barriers to overcome and complex issues to be resolved. First among them is the problem of attribution. This is why a sixth strategic initiative dealing with attribution is necessary. As one cybersecurity expert put it, “The threat of cyber war is like any great security problem; the key is not to either overreact or under react but to have a calibrated response based on the knowledge we hold.”²¹³ Developing a calibrated response is crucial to ensure that the measures the U.S. implements to prevent hostile actions do not negate the very benefits we seek to protect.²¹⁴ A calibrated and calculated response must include a framework for attribution. Cyber 3.0 is an important first step in securing the nation’s cyber domain, one that will continue to evolve in innovation, importance, and complexity. As stated in the strategy “How the Department leverages the opportunities of cyberspace while managing the inherent uncertainties and reducing vulnerabilities will significantly impact U.S. defensive readiness and national security for years to come.”²¹⁵ In other words, the stakes are high and the time to act is now. One thing is for certain, reliance on cyberspace will not lessen, nor will the complexities of defending the nation’s freedom to operate in this dynamic domain.\n²¹¹ Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n²¹² THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 6.\n²¹³ LARRY GREENEMEIER, THE FOG OF CYBERWAR: WHAT ARE THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT (2011).\n²¹⁴ Lynn, *supra* note 152.\n²¹⁵ THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, *supra* note 24, at 1."
